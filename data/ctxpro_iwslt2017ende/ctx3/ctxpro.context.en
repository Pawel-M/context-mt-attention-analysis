Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things.
was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America.
It was printed in Monterey, I checked.
Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit.
Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit.
The sign is wrong.
Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people.
It is easier than you think. It really is.
A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy.
Become a catalyst of change.
Teach others, learn about it, talk about it.
The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining.
Teach others, learn about it, talk about it.
The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining.
And it comes out in May.
Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well.
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean.
And it's how they link together.
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean.
And it's how they link together.
And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge.
We need Republicans as well.
This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is.
Become politically active.
They know perfectly well, but they have no other choice.
Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared.
And so this is what they do.
So it was a little discouraging to the students.
And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see it says, "US Peace Corps."
As it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village.
It has no other use.
It has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals.
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it.
What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with, something like charcoal.
So over the next couple of years, students and I worked to develop a process.
So you start with the bagasse, and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.
So you start with the bagasse, and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.
After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln, and then you end up with this carbonized material here.
However, you can't burn this.
After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln, and then you end up with this carbonized material here.
However, you can't burn this.
It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking.
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes.
And conveniently, one of my students was from Ghana, and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called "kokonte," which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root.
And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of "manioc."
And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking.
So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti.
So we went back to MIT, we took out the Instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces you needed in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it?
And in terms of experience of capitalism, there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences.
First, extractive industry.
Blood diamonds, smuggled emeralds, timber, that is cut right from under the poorest. Second is technical assistance.
Now in order to do this -- and this brings this group -- we have to rethink the notion of capital.
The least important form of capital, in this project, is financial capital -- money.
Money is not capital in most of the developing countries.

Money is not capital in most of the developing countries.
It's just cash.
AG: No. It's not that it didn't work.
It's that a dollar of private investment, in my judgment, is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid, in terms of the dynamic that it generates.
Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents; it could be 20 cents; or it could be four dollars.
Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.
We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?
The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon, take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys -- that's kind of cool.
Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles if the government develops and the government uses it.
You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.
Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.

And in it also brings up another point, right here.
There's a group of people that have come forward -- and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age, by us going to orbit and going to the moon here, right in this time period.
Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family, which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.
I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost, or less -- this is going to be very profitable.
I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it, the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars, will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight.
And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars, is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it, with soul. You know how strong this is.
Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me, are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story.
I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.
The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them, and they put their presentation together.
Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.
And they hadn't done anything because -- kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems, and we were asking them to create a problem.
And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know, did she fly out with me or something?
I said, "No," and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife.
And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married, the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.
We started in Bermuda for our test project, then moved up to Halifax, working down the U.S. East Coast, the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal, through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific, and we're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean.
It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel, in part to help excite young people about going into science.
The experiments are incredibly simple.
But it turns out the environment is very critical for this, and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what's in the environment.
We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms, and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.
And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms.
I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence.
I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned.
I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold.
Ok, so why is the problem accelerating? And part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use.
I'll show you what I mean.
This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS.
Uh-uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD.
Which they do.
And I have a copy.
She says, "All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder, the faster I move it across the screen."
And the technician's like, "Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?"
She goes, "Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'"  Well, if you like that one -- how much time have we got?
and every year, they say, "We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99."
I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years.
And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades.
I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.
If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address, and you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok?
There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village.

I'm sorry; it's not one yet.
When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer?
Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around.
Either one, you're going to lose.
Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around.
Either one, you're going to lose.
What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts.
And I'll just -- you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous.
Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly; period.
Like, I get hundreds of them a day; period.
Be aware in life of good design and bad design.
And if you're among the people who create this stuff: Easy is hard.
Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps.
And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this.
There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero.
They moved to an abandoned school.
So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan.
There was a way -- there had to be a way -- to get people to move around the site.
KA: But then you've got to figure out a way -- we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing.

And I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used, having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter, I think makes it a more powerful dialogue.
And that's what we were interested in.
So that, very much, is in the realm of things I've been interested in before.
And that's what we were interested in.

KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.
But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first, it would be that from the time we started building this, the big idea wasn't the technology.
It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community.
The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation.
And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.
What I don't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied.
For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns.

For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns.
So, the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.
For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns.
So, the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.
It was half as long.
It was half as long.
And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance, in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan, because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses, and a million of them urinating and doing other things, and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.
So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.
We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things, and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.
So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.
And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.
And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.
That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine; this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.
This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.
It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this, which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world, as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out, can run computers and a light bulb.
But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say, you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.
It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity, you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.
We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.
We need water.
And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it, or watching their kids die.
Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country, but also worldwide -- than everything else combined, and yet it's completely preventable for almost everybody.
It's not only preventable; it's actually reversible. And for the last almost 29 years, we've been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech, expensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost interventions can be like -- quantitative arteriography, before and after a year, and cardiac PET scans.
We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group.
But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 -- I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday -- the first time, when I was going through the vegetation, the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part, although some were a little bit acclimatized -- and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound, and I peered with my binoculars.
It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard -- and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps; they should all have numbers; that was more scientific.
Anyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest.
This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is, in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need for themselves and their families -- now, suddenly, because of the roads, the hunters can go in from the towns.
They shoot everything, every single thing that moves that's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it.
And now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it.

And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called, than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred.
It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished.
It's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in.
We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York.
Now that we know what the problems are around the world, human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems.
And we've talked a lot about that.
Secondly, the resilience of nature.

We can destroy a river, and we can bring it back to life.
I found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old.
My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon.
And I had never been a reader when I was young -- my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew; I tried all that -- and I just didn't like reading books.
If you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs.
And it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating if you have a bone fracture, and then bone cancer arises.
Because what stem cells are -- they're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue.

So, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response.
And the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged, we need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair -- because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue.

But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response, but can't quite control it.
It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated.
So this really, really fascinated me.
And I really think that we can't think about cancer -- let alone any disease -- in such black-and-white terms.
Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue is resistant to cancer, and furthermore, not only to cancer, but of metastases going to skeletal muscle.
And what metastases are is when the tumor -- when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream and goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is.
It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous.

It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous.
If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it, or somehow -- you know, it's contained. It's very contained.
And the first thing that makes me think is that blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells.
Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels.
And you think, the more highways there are in a tissue, the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases.
16 percent! Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle, but only .16 percent of actual metastases -- suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis, is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels.
We use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body -- our heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles.
Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply? It needs to be constantly contracting, so therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself.
And what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate into muscle cells. So this compound, MyoD, has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells.
So, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue, but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue, MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells?
Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells, and this is why it seems as if it is so rare.
And I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell, possibly because of all its use, has adapted faster than other body tissues to respond to injury, to fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process which the body wants to finish. I really believe that the human body is very, very smart, and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do.
It's different when a bacteria comes into the body -- that's a foreign object -- we want that out.
But when the body is actually initiating a process and we're calling it a disease, it doesn't seem as though elimination is the right solution. So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched, that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy.
I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer, out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.
He's building this huge concrete place.
And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink.
So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.
He gets up there and then he ... comes back up.
They're still talking about it.
And so to find one, a guy like that, you hang on to him.
He's become the head of Art Center, and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.
I knew Craig and respected him.
Richard Koshalek: [Unclear] starts from 2004.
FG: 2004.
You can come to the opening. I'll invite you.
And I think that's the issue, you know; it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects -- most clients aren't hiring architects for that.
They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget, be polite, and they're missing out on the real value of an architect.
RSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people -- when Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ...

And we get a lot of that.
Luckily, I'm old enough that I can complain I can't travel.
I don't have my own plane yet.
And then you just focus on this person.
You can list what you don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.
As Chaucer said, "Love is blind."
And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat.
And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.
"I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat.
But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.
The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win that promotion at work.
The motor of the brain. It's a drive.
But even at menstruation, they're better than the average man.

For one of my books, I looked at divorce data in 58 societies.
And as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce.
So the divorce rate right now is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline.
But I want to tell you a story, to illustrate.
I've been carrying on here about the biology of love.
I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too, the magic of it.
And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing.
And so we're in a skull, and we're moving really, really quickly.
And this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect, and started to run along the water next to us, in a courtship dance -- for miles.
And its shape is what gives it the function of being able to tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape.
Life adds information to matter.
In other words: structure.
Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings, if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing.
Color without pigments: this peacock is creating color with shape.
Light comes through, it bounces back off the layers; it's called thin-film interference. Imagine being able to self-assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color.
See that up-close picture?
That's a ball of water, and those are dirt particles.
And that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf.
Here are two organisms that pull water.
The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog.
The one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air, does not drink fresh water.
That is, those organisms that have not been able to figure out how to enhance or sweeten their places, are not around to tell us about it.
That's the twelfth one.
Life -- and this is the secret trick; this is the magic trick -- life creates conditions conducive to life.

I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life.
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.
Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?
Should I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing.
But at the other hand, a couple of years ago I gave up all of my possessions, sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle -- and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body, fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.

And I've since then tried to keep technology at arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life.
At the same time, I run a website on cool tools, where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology.
Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that, I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations.
And I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.
So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.
So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.
And I'm applying a similar trick to say, what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology? What does technology want?
Obviously, this in an incomplete question, just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it.
And if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say, what does evolution want? There's several things that we see.
One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we don't find life.
We find life at the bottom of every long-term, long-distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.
And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive.
And actually, we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.
And the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.
And thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say, I was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident.
So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization, towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor, you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.
I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.

I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.
This is his chart, which is not quite published yet.
But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom, those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.
When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.
And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts for the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked is sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button --  -- for buying steam valves. I mean, it was just -- it was really there.
And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample.
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.
Be it corn shellers -- you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills; all these things -- and these are not, again, antiques. These are -- you can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now, brand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don't die.
In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago.
It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact, what's important is that this information actually never died out.
So we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars.
We've heard about the Japanese giving up guns.
We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and took what I could find, the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology, and then I tried to find out when they came back in, because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time, the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited, is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology,
We've heard about this and that.

And it turns out that the time, the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited, is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology,
but you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.
That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out.
So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically, the evolution of evolvability.
So what's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks, are increasing. And the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring.
And then what we see in the singularity, that prophesized by Kurzweil and others -- his idea that technology is accelerating evolution.
We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals.
That's what technology really wants.
I'm going to skip through some of the objections because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.

I'm going to skip through some of the objections because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.
I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies. I don't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about, maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.
All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game.
That's what we're talking about.
You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.
That recursive nature is the infinite game.
And if you play that well, you'll have other people involved, so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.
That is the infinite game. And what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game.

I think I was supposed to talk about my new book, which is called "Blink," and it's about snap judgments and first impressions.
And it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.
Instead, he looked at the data, and he said, let's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters.
Let's see if they congregate around certain ideas.
And sure enough, if you sit down, and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce, you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups.
Which were thin, you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta.
That's what it was. And why were we attached to that?
Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce, A.
And when I started my blog, it was really this one goal -- I said, "I am not going to be famous to the world, but I could be famous to people on the Internet."
And I set a goal. I said, "I'm going to win an award," because I had never won an award in my entire life.
And I said, "I'm going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award."
We are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there -- well, we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas,  trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas.
I'll show you an example of a bad idea.
I brought this with me, this was given to us by NBC Dateline to test.

It's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.
This was being sold to high-school administrators for $900 apiece.

It's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it.
You could dowse for all sorts of things, but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers.
So the way it works is you go down the hallway, and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker, and then you open the locker.
So it looks something like this.
I'll show you.
Here's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo.
Here's when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich -- which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino -- of course, this being America.
This casino paid $28,500 on eBay for the cheese sandwich.
And in England, there's a pop singer.
One of the top popular singers in England today, Katie Melua.
And she wrote a beautiful song.

It was in the top five in 2005, called, "Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing."
Has anyone here ever been to school?
OK, does anybody realize there's a crisis in our schools, around the world?
I'm not going to spend too much time on that, but what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects that appear when an author publishes a book.
"Burn" is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation of one of these courses.
And I think a lot of you received -- I think all of you received one of these music books in your gift pack.
A little present for you.

Just to tell you quickly about it: this is an engineering textbook.
Just to tell you quickly about it: this is an engineering textbook.
It's about 300 pages long, hardbound.
This costs -- anybody guess?
Richard Baraniuk: OK. This costs 22 dollars to the student.
Why does it cost 22 dollars?
Because it's published on demand and it's developed from this repository of open materials.
And people who are teachers out here -- whoever taught, you know this -- it's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about.
OK, back to math. Imagine -- this is possible: that every single equation that you click on in one of your new e-texts is something that you're going to be able to explore and experiment with.
So imagine your kid's algebra textbook in seventh grade.

The same type of mark-up, like MathML, for chemistry.
Imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed.

If you have not, you must learn about it.
At the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions and in lots of other projects, you can find their logo.
Clicking on that logo takes you to an absolute no-nonsense, human-readable document, a deed, that tells you exactly what you can do with this content.
Behind that is the legal code, very carefully constructed.
And Creative Commons is taking off -- over 43 million things out there, licensed with a Creative Commons license.
Not just text, but music, images, video.
This is the final product. When they sent it to me, I thought I'd failed.
It felt like nothing. It has to feel like nothing.
It was when I put the water in that I realized that I'd put a skin on water itself.
It's mass individualism from a single product. It fits the hand.
It fits arthritic hands. It fits children's hands.
It makes the product strong, the tessellation.
How that flows through me and how that comes out is what I'm trying to understand.
This is a scan through the human forearm. It's then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure. I have these in my office.
My office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab.
All the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand.
Anyway -- this is a meringue. This is another sample I have.
A meringue is made exactly the same way, in my estimation, as a bone.

It's made from polysaccharides and proteins.
I make organic things which are essential.
And they look funky, too -- but I don't set out to make funky things because I think that's an absolute disgrace.
I set out to look at natural forms.
If he was a car designer, phew, we'd all be driving one.
In his day, he was the highest taxpayer in Britain.
That is the power of organic design.
What a waste. Anyway.  No, it's true. Fuck them. You know, I mean --  I'm delivering; they're not taking. I've had this image 20 years.
I've had this image of a water droplet for 20 years, sitting on a hot bed.
That is an image of a car for me.
You see that thing. You do. You do.
And not anesthetized, separated from life.
There's a hole at the front and there's a reason for that.
I can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages, floating around on the ground, driven by AI.
When I showed this in South Africa, everybody afterwards was going, "Hey, car on a stick. Like this."
Can you imagine? A car on a stick.

And it has an internal handrail which gives it its strength.
It's this holistic integration. That's my studio. It's subterranean.
It's this holistic integration. That's my studio. It's subterranean.
It's in Notting Hill, next to all the crap -- the prostitutes and all that stuff.
It's next to David Hockney's original studio.
I bought that last year. They're very difficult to find.
If anybody's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me, I'll put it in the studio.
So I'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you'll see in the video.

That thing on the top is the world's first solar-powered garden lamp -- the first produced. Giles Revell should be talking here today -- amazing photography of things you can't see.
The first sculptural model I made for that thing in Tokyo.
Lots of stuff. There's a little leaf chair -- that golden looking thing is called "Leaf."
Before I can do that I've got to tell you about sliced bread, and a guy named Otto Rohwedder.
Now, before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s I wonder what they said? Like the greatest invention since the telegraph or something.
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread, and he focused, like most inventors did, on the patent part and the making part.

I mean, all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren't expecting, in a way they didn't necessarily want, with an ad, over and over again until they bought it.
And the thing that's happened is, they canceled the TV-industrial complex.
That just over the last few years, what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it's not working the way that it used to.
He lived in Paris. Last year, he sold 10 million dollars' worth of French bread.
Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned, by one baker at a time, in a wood-fired oven.
And when Lionel started his bakery, the French pooh-pooh-ed it.
Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned, by one baker at a time, in a wood-fired oven.
And when Lionel started his bakery, the French pooh-pooh-ed it.
They didn't want to buy his bread. It didn't look like "French bread."

It wasn't what they expected.
Not everybody wants it but they don't care.
They want to talk to the people who do, and maybe it'll spread.
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world.
They only sell them on their website.
Those people who buy them have the otaku, and then they tell their friends, and it spreads and it spreads.
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars, 10 times the standard.

But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model.
Oh, you like my ring? It's my grandmother.
Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry.
But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne -- you don't have to be super-outrageous to do this.
What can we build here?" And like most committees, they were going to build something pretty safe.
And then an artist came to them -- this is a true artist's rendering -- he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town.
That's a purple cow; that's something worth noticing.
And for the worse -- not for the better, but for the worse.
It had a huge impact on life.
So what was it about crack cocaine?
So what was it about crack cocaine?
It was a brilliant way of getting the brain high.
Because you could smoke crack cocaine -- you can't smoke powdered cocaine -- and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism of delivering a high than snorting it.
So if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have what the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is, it's that, if I had to draw a parallel between the gang and any other organization, it would be that the gang is just like McDonald's, in a lot of different respects -- the restaurant McDonald's.
which isn't maybe the most interesting way, but it's a good way to start -- is in the way it's organized, the hierarchy of the gang, the way it looks.
So here's what the org chart of the gang looks like.
which isn't maybe the most interesting way, but it's a good way to start -- is in the way it's organized, the hierarchy of the gang, the way it looks.
So here's what the org chart of the gang looks like.
I don't know if you know much about org charts, but if you were to assign a stripped-down and simplified McDonald's org chart, this is exactly what it would look like.
Often, our theories fail quite miserably when we over the data, but what's kind of interesting is that in this setting, it turned out that some of the economic theories that worked not so well in the real economy in some sense, because it's unfettered capitalism.
Here's an economic principle.
This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics, called a "compensating differential."
Once upon a time, there was a dread disease that afflicted children.
And in fact, among all the diseases that existed in this land, it was the worst. It killed the most children.
And along came a brilliant inventor, a scientist, who came up with a partial cure for that disease.
And in fact, among all the diseases that existed in this land, it was the worst. It killed the most children.
And along came a brilliant inventor, a scientist, who came up with a partial cure for that disease.
And it wasn't perfect. Many children still died, but it was certainly better than what they had before.
And along came a brilliant inventor, a scientist, who came up with a partial cure for that disease.
And it wasn't perfect. Many children still died, but it was certainly better than what they had before.
And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free, virtually free, and was very easy to use.
Anyway, it turns out that those two crashes, that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse. So, he gets about a 500 out of -- you know, on this range -- relative to a 400 and something.
But still, if you just took that data from that crash to the federal government, and said, "I have invented a new car seat.
I would like you to approve it for selling," then they would say, "This is a fantastic new car seat, it works great.
No matter what I've done, what I've tried to do, everybody says it can't be done.
And it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of realities that you confront with your ideas.
And to be an architect, somehow you have to negotiate between left and right, and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place and the outside world, and then make it understood.
And the idea was the relationship of the space, which was made up of the fold of the image, and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration, and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space, which were in dialog.
And it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things, and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces, and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations.
And this was the first prototype in Korea, as we're dealing with a dynamic envelope, and then the same characteristic of the fabric.
This is a building in San Francisco which is under construction.
And now it turned into something much, much broader as a problem, and it has to do with performance.
This will be the first building in the United States that took -- well, I can't say it took the air conditioning out. It's a hybrid.
It's a wrong attitude, actually, because the hybrid is probably more interesting.
But we took the air conditioning out of the tower.
There's some air conditioning left in the base, but the skin now moves on hydraulics.
But we took the air conditioning out of the tower.
There's some air conditioning left in the base, but the skin now moves on hydraulics.
It forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind.
This is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona -- well, whatever it is, a model, a conceptual, kind of idea.
And it's the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable.
So it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that Earth.
And this is how they see the world.
They have 22 satellites zipping around at plus or minus 100 miles, and the site's in red.
And what we really want to do -- well, the architects, if there are architects out there, this is the Laugier Hut; this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long -- and what we wanted to do is really build this, because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world, and we wanted them to look down at their satellite, how they see their own site, that eight-acre site,
We put one piece directly north-south, and it holds the dishes at the ears, right?
And then right below that the processing, and the mission lift, and the mission control room, and all the other spaces are underground.
And what you look at is an aircraft carrier that's performance-driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes.
The new capital competition for Berlin, four years ago.
And again we just finished the ECB -- actually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project, where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue of a park, which is parallel to the river, and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric -- the social, cultural and the landscape, recreational fabric of the city.
And the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing, but something that's only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time.
And a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank, which again used this idea of connecting typology, the traditional buildings, and morphology, or the relationship of the development of land as an idea, into a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting, this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it,
and other parts are much more energetic and intense.
And talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together, and then where part of it is in the ground, part of it is oppositional lifts.
One enters the building as it lifts off the ground, and it becomes part of the idea.
And then the skin -- the edges of this -- all promote the dynamic, the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts, geologic shifts. Right?
And it makes for event space and then it breaks in places that allow you to peer into the interior, and those interiors, again, are promoting transparency for the workplace, which has been a continual interest of ours.
And I'm a character that's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there's no such thing as nature any more. Nature is gone.
Nature in the 19th-century sense, alright?
Nature is only a cultural edifice today, right?
"Valicia."
"Jacynthe."
But another layer of representation was still introduced.
That's how distant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours.
So that overmatched capability creates problems -- catastrophic successes the White House calls them.
And we're trying to figure that out, because it is an amazing capability.
It's not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him.
I knew we'd kick ass in the war with the Leviathan Force.
I knew we'd have a hard time with what followed.
And they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau, way in the western part of the country.
This is at 17,000 feet.
And they had just come down from the high pastures, at 18,000 feet.
Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA.
And since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it.
But it slightly bores me.
And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major, and thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough, maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology.
Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book called "What is Life?" by the great physicist, Schrodinger.
And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know.
I went there without knowing him. He was 35. I was 23.
And within a day, we had decided that maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA.
Not solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model, an electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know, length, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs.
So we built a three-stranded model.
The people from London came up.
Wilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator, Rosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model.
And boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped.
I have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything.
And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.
And boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped.

And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.
I have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything.
And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.
And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap.
But, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right.
So think about it. The next five years, there were essentially something like five references to our work in "Nature" -- none.
And so we were left by ourselves, and trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you -- what does this genetic information do?
So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call "DNA biopsies." Before you get treated for cancer, you should really look at this technique, and get a feeling of the face of the enemy.
It's not a -- it's only a partial look, but it's a -- I think it's going to be very, very useful.
So, we started with breast cancer because there's lots of money for it, no government money.
And I was thinking this morning of the good life, and before I show you the rest of my presentation, I'm going to violate TED rules here, and I'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can.
Because I think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is.
So -- "The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad.
Because I think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is.
So -- "The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad.
It was a 10 by 10 cell.



And that's essentially our main cost.
We could actually do without the employee.
We hired Brian because he was working part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia, so we actually hired him, so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes.
We could actually do without the employee.
We hired Brian because he was working part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia, so we actually hired him, so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes.
So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is, why isn't it all rubbish? Why is the website as good as it is?
The reason for this is if we say we're only going to write the "truth" about some topic, that doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write, because I don't agree with you about what's the truth.
But we have this jargon term of neutrality, which has its own long history within the community, which basically says, any time there's a controversial issue, Wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue.
We should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it.
If you engage in that type of behavior, you'll be asked to leave the community.
So, real-time peer review.
Every single change on the site goes to the "Recent changes" page.
That recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel, which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools.
And people can get RSS feeds -- they can get email notifications of changes.
And then users can set up their own personal watch list.
And then users can set up their own personal watch list.
So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists, because it is sometimes vandalized.
And therefore, what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly, and then they'll just simply revert the change.
And so, as long as people trust me in my role, then that's a valid place for me.
Of course, because of the free licensing, if I do a bad job, the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave -- I can't tell anyone what to do.
So the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works, it's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work, but we are not fanatical web anarchists.
Jimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia.
There's a media storyline about Wikipedia, which I think is false.
It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers.
If we could convert 0.03 percent of the sunlight that falls on the earth into energy, we could meet all of our projected needs for 2030.
We can't do that today because solar panels are heavy, expensive and very inefficient.
There are nano-engineered designs, which at least have been analyzed theoretically, that show the potential to be very lightweight, very inexpensive, very efficient, and we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way.
A personal experience, when I was at MIT -- computer taking up about the size of this room, less powerful than the computer in your cell phone.
But Moore's Law, which is very often identified with this exponential growth, is just one example of many, because it's basically a property of the evolutionary process of technology.
I put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph -- by the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth -- that's another exponential.
These things have already been done in animals.
There's one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes. It's blood cell-sized.
They put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell -- they tried this in rats -- it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion, and actually cures type 1 diabetes.
Wall Street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology, which it was, but then six months later, when it hadn't revolutionized all business models, they figured, well, that was wrong, and then we had this bust.
All right, this is a technology that we put together using some of the technologies we're involved in.
This will be a routine feature in a cell phone.
Images will be written directly to our retina, providing full-immersion virtual reality, augmented real reality. We'll be interacting with virtual personalities.
But if we go to 2029, we really have the full maturity of these trends, and you have to appreciate how many turns of the screw in terms of generations of technology, which are getting faster and faster, we'll have at that point.
I mean, we will have two-to-the-25th-power greater price performance, capacity and bandwidth of these technologies, which is pretty phenomenal.
You can plug in and experience what it's like to be someone else.
But most importantly, it'll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology, which in some sense we're doing already.
We routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology.
OK. Hands up: anyone in the audience who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?
OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.
But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end, because the majority of the British public, and certainly the majority of members of Parliament, came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society.
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades.
What part of this do people not understand?
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades.
What part of this do people not understand?
It's not just about life, of course --  -- it's about healthy life, you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun.
What part of this do people not understand?
It's not just about life, of course --  -- it's about healthy life, you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun.
So really, this is how I would like to describe it.
There are some good points to be made here, things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.
But these are completely crazy, when you actually remember your sense of proportion.
You know, these are arguments; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about.
Right. So the next thing is, now why should we get a little bit more active on this?
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.
Right. So the next thing is, now why should we get a little bit more active on this?
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.
Just suppose, as I said, that we do acquire -- let's say we do it today for the sake of argument -- the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55.
I'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK.
What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -- or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -- would actually live?
Which we can now, as I've explained, equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.
Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things, starting from the time we get the mice?
And thirdly, the question is, what will it do to actually how much people want it?
So they'll probably think it's five years away.
They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology.
And the reason it's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.
So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.
So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.
We can call it the "engineering approach," and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.
Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it.
The point about this slide is actually the bottom.
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging, we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another.
AG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158.
Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.
However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die, so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.


Nature's my muse and it's been my passion.
But there were also revelations.
And one of those I'd like to share with you today.
I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago, back before the sky turned blue.
And they changed the atmosphere.
A breath that's fossilized now as iron.
Meteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too.
Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate.
These are diatoms, single-celled phytoplankton with skeletons of silicon ...
circuit boards of the future.
We're molded by the same life force.
The blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the Earth.
And our brains -- our celebrated brains -- reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.
The blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the Earth.
And our brains -- our celebrated brains -- reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.
Life is a force in its own right. It is a new element.

And it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin.
And it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin.
And where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter, Mars is still not very far.
But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again.

And that is that we all in this room learned how to walk, how to talk, not by being taught how to talk, or taught how to walk, but by interacting with the world, by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something, or being able to stand up and reach it.
Whereas at about the age six, we were told to stop learning that way, and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching, whether it's people standing up, like I'm doing now, or a book, or something.
But it was really through teaching.
So, One Laptop Per Child was formed about a year and a half ago.
It's a nonprofit association. It raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built, and then have it produced afterwards.
Scale is truly important.
Scale is truly important.
And it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price, OK?
It's because you can go to a manufacturer -- and I will leave the name out -- but we wanted a small display, doesn't have to have perfect color uniformity.
People clap, sometimes you even get standing ovations, and I say, "What the hell's wrong with you? Why are we all sitting there?"
And somebody -- to remain nameless -- called our laptop a "gadget" recently.
And I said, "God, our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell.
It'll be just like it was in 1985, when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512.
It worked really well.
And we've been going steadily downhill.
It worked really well.
And we've been going steadily downhill.
Now, people ask all the time what it is.
And we've been going steadily downhill.

That's what it is.
So you really can bring into a village, and then the villages can connect themselves, and you really can do it quite well.
The dual mode display -- the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors -- isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight?
Well, you can't see it.
So that's another project for NASA.
That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.
This artist's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.
Well, most of you anyway.
The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all, greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right.
And it's this science, which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world, but also transforming our world faster than ever.
And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable when the downside could be of global consequence.
In fact, some years ago, Bill Joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over, etc.
I don't go along with all that, but it's interesting that he had a simple solution.
It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.
It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.
So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.
So, again, this idea of workarounds.
We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot, sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I've been here.
This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life -- and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential -- is something that we look at a lot.

We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it, called "Thoughtless Acts?"
We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street, that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.
It's there for our use, on some level.
So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment to do all these different things.
Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh.
A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA, and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children.
This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
It's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes -- it's turning them into entrepreneurs.
These guys are using this very successfully.
And for us, it's been great because it's won loads of design awards.
The annual death rate, then, becomes 56 million.
If we just look at the single, biggest cause of death -- aging -- it accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die.
That adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of Canada.
If we just look at the single, biggest cause of death -- aging -- it accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die.

Sometimes, we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big.

Can't see it because it's too big.
Existential risk is a threat to human survival, or to the long-term potential of our species.
Now, why do I say that this is a big problem?
Well, let's first look at the probability -- and this is very, very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years, which is surprising.
So if you take into account future generations as much as our own, every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant.
The only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve.
And even if you just look at the current people, and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct, it should still have a high priority.
Or when you understood something you had never done before.
Or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love.
Or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a great piece of art.
You just want to cling onto this.
And then, of course, it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades.
And it's really difficult to recall, in a normal frame of mind, just how good life can be at its best.
And then, of course, it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades.
And it's really difficult to recall, in a normal frame of mind, just how good life can be at its best.
Or how bad it can be at its worst.
That's probably not all that difficult.
It might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this.
It's been done in voles.
Now, why is that a good thing to do?
Well, we know already that in this little human circle there, there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being -- human life at its best is wonderful.
We have no reason to believe that within this much, much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being, perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about.
Well, this is what I found.
Of course, I hope I can memorize it.
The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings.
It's called "Kaleidoscope."
And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century, and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time.
I have another piece that I'd like to play for you.
That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.
But he wrote that for his wife.
So actually, if you listen carefully, there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.

Language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets.
It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion, but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time.  And yet, that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later, on the other side of the universe, some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain, above all -- there's your reference -- what was happening there, in reality.
The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model of the other, the quasar.
Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist.
In regard to global warming, I'm just a layman. And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory.
And according to that theory, it's already too late to avoid a disaster, because if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol, with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars, or whatever it is, then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.
Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance.
And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure, but that's only if we know what to prevent.
If you've been punched on the nose, then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches.
So, this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future.
Now, TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker about "do this, do that" and you fill out all these forms, and you don't actually know how they're going to describe you, and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist.
And I've always been nervous about the term "futurist," because you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it.
And I've always been nervous about the term "futurist," because you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it.
And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have, and said, "You know, well, if I have to talk about the future, what is it?"
And George Homsey, a great guy, said, "Oh, the future is amazing.
The feature side is -- you know, people will say, [unclear] down around about 65 nanometers now.
On the right, that's a radiolara.
That's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans.
That's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans.
And that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers, and it's a complex 3D structure.
We could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way.
So, Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday, I believe, but I'll show you again.
This is literally the colored sequence of those tiles.
Each different color has a different magnetic polarity, and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out.

And then literally, you now pour on a monomer.
You know, I'll do a Julia Childs here.
This is three minutes of UV light.
And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you've cooked it. Pop it out.
I've seen this video, but I still don't know if it's going to end right.
So you reverse this. This is a very old movie, so with the new prototypes, actually both surfaces are flexible, but this will show you the point.
And as I rotate it against this side shot, you'll see that that has cylinder, and that was programmed in -- literally into the physics of the system.
So, this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things, like this.
This is something that my people at SQUID Labs are working on at the moment, called "electronic rope."

And it turned out that -- I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.
But I actually walked away with a great job offer.
And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags, and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking, "Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up, I'm going to have a good time working here.
And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags, and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking, "Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up, I'm going to have a good time working here.
But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful."
So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it.
and, I think, particularly, the Swiss , don't seem to be doing all that well.
Last November, a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum, in a skyscraper, up on the 56th floor.
And their inaugural exhibit was called "Happiness."




The old story about climate protection is that it's costly, or it would have been done already.
So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it.
It could well be enough to double the oil price, for example.
And one of the worst of these is what it does to our standing in the world if other countries think that everything we do is about oil, if we have to treat countries that have oil differently than countries that don't have oil.
And our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in Far-off-istan when what they actually signed up for was to protect American citizens.
This muscle car from Toyota: 408 horsepower in an ultra-light that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds, and still gets 32 miles a gallon. I'll say more later about this.
And in the upper left, a pioneering effort 14 years ago by GM -- 84 miles a gallon without even using a hybrid, in a four-seater.
Well, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon.
Maybe you ought to buy efficiency at 26 bucks instead of 12.
Or wait to capture the second half of it.
Or we could, of course, just get this little bit by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil, or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us.
Or wait to capture the second half of it.
Or we could, of course, just get this little bit by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil, or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us.
But they'll sell it to Japan and China instead, because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers, and they don't.
Those part inefficient planes are worth more to society dead than alive.
We ought to take them out back and shoot them, and put bounty hunters after them.
Then there's an important military role.
Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump.
There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river.
I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving.
Think bike shops, juice stands.
We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects.
This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.
The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway.
We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development.
We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices.
We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce, innovative, sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives.
So I started my life as an architect, or training as an architect, and I was always interested in socially responsible design, and how you can really make an impact.
But when I went to architecture school, it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family.
So I started my life as an architect, or training as an architect, and I was always interested in socially responsible design, and how you can really make an impact.
But when I went to architecture school, it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family.
Many architects seemed to think that when you design, you design a jewel, and it's a jewel that you try and crave for; whereas I felt that when you design, you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing.
So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change, we build that change.
So here's a select number of projects.
This is Kosovo in '99. We did an open design competition, like I said.
Using straw bale construction, creating heat walls.
And then something remarkable happened in '99.
We went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue.
And so again, we had a whole variety of ideas that came in.
This one I personally love, because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions, but about raising awareness.
This is a kenaf clinic. You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land, and it grows 14 feet in a month.
And so we decided to look at the idea of sports, and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV/AIDS outreach center, and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors.
So that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care.
And we picked nine finalists, and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region, and then the community picked their design.
And we met, literally, a couple of months ago. We've already developed a design.
The team is over there, working in partnership.
This was a matchmaking, thanks to a couple of TEDsters -- Sun [Microsystems], Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli, who connected me with this amazing African woman.
And to me the whole notion -- the things I'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress.
And as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems, I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect.
And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world, but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down -- but there's a growing footprint that's happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate, and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy, I think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution,
And they're going to push that up, from the bottom -- up into, I believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it, and trying to help them with the projects.
And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way, and starts to teach them. They know about recycling now, but they don't really, I think, get sustainability in all the things, and the energy footprint, and how that matters.
And to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish, and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.
And to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish, and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.
And again, in "In My World," the competition -- we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it.
And I like the words, "in my world," because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it.
Look at the difference there. It doesn't take much -- every layperson could see that difference, and computers can be programmed to easily detect it.
Then, look at that after three minutes.
We see that the signal that's actually in the heart, we can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack even before they have symptoms so we can save their life.
And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table.
It'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because, if you don't, you're in deep doo-doo.
And then, finally, a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation, which is the level which says you are having a heart attack.
Then it goes to a diagnostic center, and within one minute of your heart attack, your signal appears on the screen of a computer and the computer analyzes what your problem is.
And the person who's there, the medical practitioner, calls you -- this is also a cell phone -- and says, "Mr. Smith, you're in deep doo-doo; you have a problem.
We've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way.
And the person who's there, the medical practitioner, calls you -- this is also a cell phone -- and says, "Mr. Smith, you're in deep doo-doo; you have a problem.
We've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way.
It'll pick you up, and then we're going to call your doctor, tell him about it.
So here's a picture of what we're doing.
The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura have a band of excited neurons -- that's shown in red -- that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain.
And when it hits the mid-brain, that's when the headache begins.
It's sort of funny dancing lights, shown there on the left and right side.
And that's a fully developed visual aura, as we see on top.
In the middle, our experimentalist, the neurologist, who said, "I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura."
It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse, but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper, say it is scientifically sound -- that, in fact, when the average person gets a migraine, it's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse.
The zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that.
Yousef Mohammed: In other words, we're treating electricity with electricity, rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays.
Now, unfortunately, us technical people, unlike Mr. Bono, have to get into all these technical words.
Well, "responsive electrical stimulation" means that we sense, at a place in your brain which is called an "epileptic focus," which is where the epileptic seizure begins -- we sense there, that it's going to happen, and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot, which erases the errant signal so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache.
We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart.

We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart.
We thought we could adapt it for the brain.
If that's the source of the epilepsy, we can attack that as well.
The comprehensive solution: this is the device; it's about one inches by two inches and, oddly enough, just the thickness of most cranial bones.
The advantages of responsive neurostimulation: It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur, provide stimulation only when needed, can be turned off if seizures disappear; it has minimal side effects -- as a matter of fact, in all our clinical trials to date, we've seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it's been implanted -- and it's invisible, cosmetically hidden, so, if you have epilepsy and you have the device,
I have three wishes. Well, I can't do much about Africa.
I'm a tech; I'm into medical gadgetry, which is mostly high-tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about.
The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator, called RNS, for Responsive NeuroStimulator -- that's a brilliant acronym -- for the treatment of other brain disorders.
The second wish is, at the present time, the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators -- that's what TMS means, device to treat migraine headaches -- appears to be quite successful.
Well, that's the good news.
The present portable device is far from optimally designed, both as to human factors as appearance.
Can you say that?
Audience: Early detection, early response.
Larry Brilliant: Smallpox was the worst disease in history.

It killed more people than all the wars in history.
The Seva Foundation was started by a group of alumni of the Smallpox Eradication Programme, who, having climbed the highest mountain, tasted the elixir of the success of eradicating a disease, wanted to do it again.
And over the last 27 years, Seva's programs in 15 countries have given back sight to more than two million blind people.
Seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue: blindness, which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease.

Seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue: blindness, which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease.
This year, that one hospital will give back sight to more than 300,000 people in Tamil Nadu, India.
Bird flu. I stand here as a representative of all terrible things -- this might be the worst.
The key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response.
It initially goes quite slowly.
You get two or three discrete locations.
Then there'll be secondary outbreaks, and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you.

Within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world.
"The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty."
And I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that.
Now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone, maybe we should listen.
You see, if this is true, and I believe it is, that the digital world you all created has uncoupled the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter, this should be a piece of piss.
I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes.
Most of them impossible, some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral.
Please visit ONE at this address.
We're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice.
Bono: All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information, its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives, by connecting every hospital, health clinic and school in one African country.
That would be the second best investment that we could do.
And the very best project would be to focus on HIV/AIDS.
Basically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years, we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS.
Or did you get close to what we came up with here?
Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again.
I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.

What I'm going to do, in the spirit of collaborative creativity, is simply repeat many of the points that the three people before me have already made, but do them -- this is called "creative collaboration;" it's actually called "borrowing" -- but do it through a particular perspective, and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers in this emerging world of collaborative creativity that Jimmy and others have talked about.
Let me just ask you, to start with, this simple question: who invented the mountain bike?

Let me just ask you, to start with, this simple question: who invented the mountain bike?
Because traditional economic theory would say, well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big R&D lab where they were thinking up new projects, and it came out of there. It didn't come from there.
Build creative clusters in cities; create more R&D parks, so on and so forth.
Expand the pipeline down to the consumers.
Well this view, I think, is increasingly wrong.
Take astronomy as an example, which Yochai has already mentioned.
Twenty years ago, 30 years ago, only big professional astronomers with very big telescopes could see far into space.
And there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank, and when I was a kid, it was amazing, because the moon shots would take off, and this thing would move on rails.
I was worried. That's why I began this piece.
I was worried about vaginas. I was worried what we think about vaginas and even more worried that we don't think about them.
I was worried about my own vagina.
There is so much darkness and secrecy surrounding them.
Like the Bermuda Triangle, nobody ever reports back from there.
In the first place, it's not so easy to even find your vagina.
Women love to talk about their vaginas, they do.
Mainly because no one's ever asked them before.
Let's just start with the word "vagina" -- vagina, vagina.
Let's just start with the word "vagina" -- vagina, vagina.
It sounds like an infection, at best. Maybe a medical instrument.
"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina!"
It sounds like an infection, at best. Maybe a medical instrument.
"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina!"
Vagina, vagina, vagina. It doesn't matter how many times you say the word, it never sounds like a word you want to say.
"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina!"
Vagina, vagina, vagina. It doesn't matter how many times you say the word, it never sounds like a word you want to say.
It's a completely ridiculous, totally un-sexy word.
This is how the "Vagina Monologues" begins.
But it really didn't begin there. It began with a conversation with a woman.
We were having a conversation about menopause, and we got onto the subject of her vagina, which you'll do if you're talking about menopause.
And that woman said something more amazing, and then the next woman said something more amazing, and before I knew it, every woman was telling me I had to talk to somebody about their vagina because they had an amazing story, and I was sucked down the vagina trail.
And I really haven't gotten off of it. I think if you had told me when I was younger that I was going to grow up, and be in shoe stores, and people would scream out, "There she is, the Vagina Lady!"
I don't know that that would have been my life ambition.
There are three qualities I want to talk about.
One is seeing what's right in front of you, and talking about it, and stating it.
I think what I learned from talking about the vagina and speaking about the vagina, is it was the most obvious thing -- it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world -- and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about.
And women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream.
And I don't think I ever understood pleasure until that moment, and how women have found a way to keep their pleasure alive.
It has taken me, this journey, to Islamabad, where I have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off.
I have met these women everywhere on the planet, and I want to tell a few stories, because I believe that stories are the way that we transmit information, where it goes into our bodies. And I think one of the things about being at TED that's been very interesting is that I live in my body a lot, and I don't live in my head very much anymore.
And this is a very heady place.
And it's been really interesting to be in my head for the last two days; I've been very disoriented --  because I think the world, the V-world, is very much in your body.
There's another woman, named Agnes.
And Agnes, for me, epitomizes what a vagina warrior is.
I met her three years ago in Kenya. And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl; she was circumcised against her will when she was 10 years old, and she really made a decision that she didn't want this practice to continue anymore in her community.
It was a gorgeous day in the African sun, and the dust was flying and the girls were dancing, and there was this house, and it said, "V-Day Safe House for the Girls."
And it hit me in that moment that it had taken 47 years, but that Mr. Alligator had finally shown up.
And he had shown up, obviously, in a form that it took me a long time to understand, which is that when we give in the world what we want the most, we heal the broken part inside each of us.
Google should have something like this in their lobby.  I'll show you a little more of a concrete example here, This is a photographer's light-box application.
Again, I can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around.
But what's even cooler is that if I have two fingers, I can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily.
It's just so much fun playing around with it, too.  And so the last thing I want to show you is -- I'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps that you can do with this thing.
I'm more interested in the creative applications we can do with this.
Now, here's a simple application here -- I can draw out a curve.
And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents.
And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.
So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity.
And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.
So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity.
My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.
And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.
Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists.
The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up.
And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet.
We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence.
We know three things about intelligence.
If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in I get annoyed.
I say, "Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here."  Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it, did it happen?
Remember that old chestnut?
Take her to a dance school."
I said, "What happened?"
She said, "She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was.
The other half of the audience doesn't like head-tail-tail -- they think, for deep cultural reasons, that's boring -- and they're much more interested in a different pattern -- head-tail-head.
So, on this side, you get out your coins, and you toss and toss and toss.
And you count the number of times until the pattern head-tail-head appears and you average them. OK?
Don't think you don't trust me anymore.
Well, you're right to be a bit skeptical, because that's not the answer.
That's what you might think.
It actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is.
So let me try and illustrate that.
Here's a little caricature of a million individuals.
And we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial that that's unlikely, because of the presumption of innocence.
And then if she were trying to kill the children, she succeeded.
So the chance that she's innocent isn't one in 73 million.



And amazingly, that evolution sustains the trajectory that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity.
By cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas.
A lot of you have heard the term "memes." The evolution of technology, I pay a lot of attention to, so, you know, one of the first things you got was a little hand axe.
Now, this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way, because when you think of non-zero, you think win-win, you know, that's good. Well, there are a few reasons that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat.
First of all, it can accommodate; it doesn't deny the existence of inequality exploitation war.
But there's a more fundamental reason that it's not intrinsically upbeat, because a non-zero-sum game, all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse.
Now, the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter.
I mean, if you've got to have an enemy, do make it Ann Coulter.
But it's not a crazy concern, OK, because understanding behavior can lead to a kind of empathy, and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love, and so on.


I'm often asked, "What surprised you about the book?"
So, everybody's betting their life on something.
And when I, you know, made a bet, I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was.
And I believe in a pluralistic society, everybody's betting on something.
And when I, you know, made a bet, I happened to believe that Jesus was who he said he was.
And I believe in a pluralistic society, everybody's betting on something.
And when I started the church, you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now.
You are a steward of it.
For instance, that's why I believe in protecting the environment.
This is not my planet.
And I asked this guy, I said, "Well, do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation?
Do you think we have a stewardship here, to take the environment seriously?"
And he said, "No."
codify it or qualify it or quantify it, and say, "This is what I believe in. This is why I believe what I believe."
I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist.
But you may, you may.
I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist.
But you may, you may.
Your worldview, though, does determine everything else in your life, because it determines your decisions; it determines your relationships; it determines your level of confidence.
So all of this money started pouring in, and all of this fame started pouring in.
And I'm going, what do I do with this?
My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money.
We just said, we're not going to use it on us.
The second thing was, I stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor.
Third thing is, I added up all that the church had paid me over the last 25 years, and I gave it back.
Or your net worth.
And, by the way, your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth.
Your value is not based on your valuables.
They're just not in my pathway.
Now, they're 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana.
So I had to say, ok, I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got to help those who don't have either of those.
And God says, "Throw it down."
And if you saw the movie, you know, he throws it down and it becomes a snake.
And then God says, "Pick it up."
And God says, "Throw it down."
And if you saw the movie, you know, he throws it down and it becomes a snake.

Well, it was a shepherd's staff. Now, follow me on this.
This staff represented three things about Moses' life.
First, it represented his identity; he was a shepherd.
This staff represented three things about Moses' life.
First, it represented his identity; he was a shepherd.
It's the symbol of his own occupation: I am a shepherd. It's a symbol of his identity, his career, his job.
In those days, nobody had bank accounts, or American Express cards, or hedge funds.
Your assets are tied up in your flocks.
So it's a symbol of his identity, and it's a symbol of his income.
And I asked them, I said, "What's in your hand?
So, what's in your hand?" I said, "It's a basketball.
And that basketball represents your identity, who you are: you're an NBA player. It represents your income: you're making a lot of money off that little ball.
We have to plan issues many months in advance; we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months, nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.
We also, like a lot of companies, create a product that's based on technology trends.
In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky, some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.
But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.
And then it's time to do it again. Last year.
And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.
And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision -- a collision with something else -- for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.
And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be, and maybe how you can do something about it.
The first is the critical price.
And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be, and maybe how you can do something about it.
The first is the critical price.
The first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price.
Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it; it's an opportunity for the technology to change.
And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi -- you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass, but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet -- there's still more opportunity in that.
I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD, which is a technology which has done all of these.

I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD, which is a technology which has done all of these.
The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998, it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.

And it started to take off. And you can see that the units started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them, and bring the rest of your entertainment in.
What's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999.
Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment, that was an inflection point that he could do something with.

The next phase it hit was displacement.
They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there -- they're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods.
But I think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.
Start with gene sequencing.
Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about.
Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere; it's a little hard to use right now.
There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.



You think of, you know, urbanization, consumerism, the workplace, technology.
But I think if you cut through those forces, you get to what might be the deeper driver, the nub of the question, which is how we think about time itself.
In other cultures, time is cyclical.

And, in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration, lie what a lot of people now refer to as the "International Slow Movement."
Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy, I'll just give you a very quick overview of what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food, many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement.
Started in Italy, but has spread across the world, and now has 100,000 members in 50 countries.

And good slow is, you know, taking the time to eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off.
Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life.
Now, one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out, is the reaction to it.
And what that means is that I no longer overload myself gratuitously.
My default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic.
I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near, or at least not as much as I did before.
I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near, or at least not as much as I did before.
I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off.
And the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier, healthier, more productive than I ever have.
They need you to move at their rhythm.
I find that 10 minutes into a story, you know, my son will suddenly say, "You know, something happened in the playground today that really bothered me."
And we'll go off and have a conversation on that.
Right? Picture a little Earth, circling around the sun.
You know, about a million years ago, a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees, got a little clever, harnessed fire, invented the printing press, made, you know, luggage with wheels on it.
And, you know, built the society that we now live in.
And, you know, built the society that we now live in.
Unfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt, the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created, it's got some major, major flaws.
One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint.
It's doing something new. There's new things happening.
There's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things.
Like, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie "City of God?"
Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight.
Here's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area, will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable.
Here's a way of transporting water.
I just love this, you know -- I mean carrying water is such a drag, and somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right?
I mean, that's a great design.
This is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw.
And I want to offer you a deal.
Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months, because I have elections -- there are elections coming up in nine months.
I will not run, but it's very important for me who is going to succeed me.
So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you.
I have no interest in being in media business.
How much would that cost?
Now ours is just one story.
I'm sure that in this room there are, like, 15 other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work.
Here is where the problem is, and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.
Their sexual behavior is too human-like for most of us to be comfortable with.
But --  actually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside.
But --  actually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.

It permeates their entire life.
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside.

And it's used for communication.
I hope I have a lighter.
You can use the lighter to start the fire.
SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.
Video: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram.
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar."
Once you have that capacity, the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely.
So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos, like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting -- we want to create an environment in which they have fun, and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them.
Narrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha.
So, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit, this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species -- recorded at 1,000 frames a second, played back at 15 frames per second.
And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs, exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it.
Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod, and these guys open up snails for a living.
Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod, and these guys open up snails for a living.
And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack.
So, I'll play it one more time.
So, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end, or it can smash with the heel.
And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike.
And so the first question that came to mind was, well, how fast does this limb move?
And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department, looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology.
And so we struck up a deal.
I said, "Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system that could capture these movements, you guys can film us collecting the data."
So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb, whether it's a spearer or a smasher, is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here.
It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse.
It's a very beautiful structure.
And this is very well known to engineers and architects, because it's a very strong surface in compression.
It has curves in two directions, one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other, so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface of this type of shape.
So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists.
And what that is, is cavitation.
And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds.
And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure, which results in the water literally vaporizing.
And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds.
And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure, which results in the water literally vaporizing.
And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat, and it's a very destructive process.
And these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring, but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail.
So, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals.
So, one question I often get after this talk -- so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal?

you'd expect. And there's something joyful about it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things. So, what I'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way,
so I can make the audience here happy.
So I'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations. First of all, I want to show you the particular illusion here. I want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other. These are all perceptual tricks. These are real objects that I'm going to show you. Now I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped

Now I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped
the film here so you can get a very interesting experience. I want you to see how this illusion is constructed, and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out. Now watch, as it rotates back, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now.
We can violate your expectations on representation -- what an image represents. What do you see here?
How many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand if you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised their hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience, go talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the best example of priming by experience that I know.
If you are a child under the age of 10 who haven't been ruined yet, you will look at this image and see dolphins. Now, some of you adults here are saying, "What dolphins? What dolphins?"
Now let's take a static image. Can you see this?
Do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up? It's completely static.
It's a static image. How many people see this illusion? It's completely static.
Or, you take this particular un-retouched photograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot of emails from people who say, "Is there any perceptual difference between males and females?"
And I really say, "No." I mean, women can navigate through the world just as well as males can -- and why wouldn't they? However, this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males: in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues. They can match the hat.
Okay, now getting to a part -- I want to show design in illusions. I believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So that when you saw from one little angle was like this. And this little technique got popular in the 16th century and the 17th century to disguise hidden meanings, where you could flip the image and
After about a million -- I mean, I got rejected from lots of places, because I was not only trying to go to a poor country, I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country.
After about a million miles, and a meaningful -- a substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a consortium, and -- which involved the Norwegian telephone company, which provided the know-how, and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service.
To make the story short, here is the coverage of the country.
We said, we're going to build a device that does what he wants.
We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom; you don't need the ones in the last two fingers.
We put this thing together.
These kids have attitudes that you just can't believe.
So I'm going to show you now, without the skin on it, a 30-second piece, and then I'm done.
But understand what you're looking at we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female, so that we could put it in any of these people.
Watch the fingers grab. The thumb comes up. Wrist.
This weighs 6.9 pounds.
Going to scratch his nose.
Going to scratch his nose.
It's got 14 active degrees of freedom.
Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger.
That's in the United States.
We are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future.
We urgently need to change this.
I've written about this idea before, and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past.
But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form, science has advanced.
Technology has moved forward.
Working together, we can make this real.
The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications.
It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness, and sense of human need.

It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity.

They not only recorded history; they helped change the course of history.
Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience, change became not only possible, but inevitable.
I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism, specifically visual journalism, can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies.

In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction, it becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior.
It puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact.
What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power, happens to ordinary citizens one by one.
And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.

And as a reaction, it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate, thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda, much as they would like to.
Coming of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital for a free and dynamic society to function properly.

The press is certainly a business, and in order to survive it must be a successful business, but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility.
Society's problems can't be solved until they're identified.
The Bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now.
At the same time in South Africa, after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison, the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid.
One of the things I had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger.
In southern Sudan, another civil war saw similar use of starvation as a means of genocide.
Again, international NGOs, united under the umbrella of the U.N., staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved.
I'm a witness, and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored.
We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti: he develops and trains paid community health workers who are able to identify health problems, ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed and take their medicine regularly, who work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation, providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care if they have problems of the severity that require it.
The procedures that make this work have been perfected, as I said, by Paul Farmer and his team in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years.
Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda.
I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid to the 35 percent of the people that have no access, but to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects, the Rwandans, interestingly enough, have been quite good, Mr. Wilson, in preserving their topsoil.
There's a couple of guys from southern farming families -- the first thing I did when I went out to this place was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt and see what they'd done with it.
We have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence can practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help.
And I thought, "How could I not have known this before?
How could it not have sunk in when they'd been telling me?
All that being good and no real credit for it.
Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.
You can't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair.
So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water, and after niceties, they said, "Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?"
That wouldn't be such a good incentive for me."
And they said, "Oh.
Hey! Well, we also believe that when you go to heaven, you get your body restored to you in its best original state.
Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see."
I said, "Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus, because I had cancer a few years ago.
So does this mean that if I went to heaven, I would get my old uterus back?" And they said, "Sure."
Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment, and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business, on which premise I write you.
Before my father death, he had the sum of 23 million United States dollars, which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war.
This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country, before the outbreak of war.
But it's peripheral activities like these that allow people to get together, doing fun things.
They actually get to know each other, and it's sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we're lacking.
And very, very quickly -- I love puppets. Here's a puppet.
And I got back to Heathrow. My mum was there; my brother was there; my granddad was there -- had a little Union Jack --  -- and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum.
I was physically exhausted, mentally an absolute wreck, considered myself a failure.
In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition, and lying on my mum's sofa, day in day out, watching daytime TV.
The next bit, we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga, which was the sort of last bit of civilization.
Our cameraman, who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times, actually asked the pilot, before we got on the plane, how long this flight would take, and the pilot -- Russian pilot -- completely deadpan, replied, "Six hours -- if we live."
We got to Khatanga.
I had to pull one, leave it, and go back and get the other one.
Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice -- the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean, the wind and the tides.
NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began.
I didn't tell Tony that. I didn't tell the pilots that.
I thought, it'll have to do.
: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Rammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off.
One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway, banking. I could see into the cockpit, Troy battling the controls, and he just took one hand off, reached back, flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit, and it was the "fasten seat belt" sign you can see on the wall.
And only from the air did I see the big picture.
Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing -- no one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan.
Two of us are doing it.
That's pretty much it.


I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin, from when I was 12 years old.

Until one day in ninth grade, when I was standing with a number of the football players.
And my body had clearly changed, and Matt, who was undeniably my nemesis in high school, said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips, but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz.
And I was so humiliated and mortified that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater.
I'm working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes, when I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy -- 11 years old -- running toward me, wearing my sweater.
And I'm thinking, no, this is not possible.
But so, curious, I run up to the child -- of course scaring the living bejesus out of him -- grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater.
But so, curious, I run up to the child -- of course scaring the living bejesus out of him -- grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater.
I tell that story, because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this Earth.
We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know.

We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build these long-lasting, five-year nets.
Here are just some pictures of the factory.
Today, three years later, the company has employed another thousand women.

Today, three years later, the company has employed another thousand women.
It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.
Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy is growth with percent.
We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase.
If I change this, and take GDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the population.
Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America.
Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now.
Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD.
So we started a nonprofit venture which, linking data to design, we called Gapminder, where they warn you, "mind the gap." So we thought Gapminder was appropriate.
And we started to write software which could link the data like this.
And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years, and we have produced animations.
And I would be very interested to get your responses to this.
It's the one policy proposal that I make in the book, at this time, when I claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make.
And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today.
I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there, somewhere between petunia and carrot.
They're not really bright. They don't have to be.
The lesson we learn from this is: you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary.

The design is there in nature, but it's not in anybody's head.
98 percent.
That is what we have done on this planet.
Now, I talked to Paul afterwards -- I wanted to check to find out how he'd calculated this, and get the sources and so forth -- and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this.

Actually, I'm going to pass over this.
The ant isn't alone.
There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which -- in that case -- A parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat.

Does that ever happen to us?
Yes, it does -- quite wonderfully.
The Arabic word "Islam" means "submission."
Those are from "The Purpose Driven Life."
And I want to turn now, briefly, to talk about that book, which I've read.
You've all got a copy, and you've just heard the man.
You've all got a copy, and you've just heard the man.
And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint, because I think it's actually a brilliant book.
First of all, the goal -- and you heard just now what the goal is -- it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions, and he has succeeded.
The book is clear, vivid, accessible, beautifully formatted.
Just enough repetition.
That's really important.
Just enough repetition.
That's really important.
Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.
That's really important.

Thank you.
And now we come to my problem.
Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I said about this book.
And you can't tell.
So I'm sort of thinking, "Well, I don't know, I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet."
But then I read on, and I read this: "First, Noah had never seen rain, because prior to the Flood, God irrigated the earth from the ground up."
Well, this is from "The Purpose Driven Life": "The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life: the compass I rely on for direction, the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions, and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything."
Well maybe, OK, but what's going to follow from this?
And here's one that does concern me.
My excitement is: I get a chance to give something back.
My challenge is: the shortest seminar I usually do is 50 hours.
I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends -- I do more, obviously, I also coach people -- but I'm into immersion, because how did you learn language?
What I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today, for two reasons.
One: so that you can contribute more.
And two: that hopefully we can not just understand other people more, but appreciate them more, and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today.
This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do, and that no other animal can do quite like we can. It's a marvelous adaptation.
It's up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall.
All of you have done this.
"Free? Aren't you just giving me my own paper?"
"Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper!
Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same!"
You ever want to change your mind, it's totally returnable."
The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite: "Make your choice, and by the way, the mail is going out, gosh, in two minutes, to England.
Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic.
It's a very small increase, and it doesn't much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition.
Wrong-o. Bad simulators. Because here's what's really happening.
Both right before the swap and five days later, people who are stuck with that picture, who have no choice, who can never change their mind, like it a lot!
They don't like their picture, and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired, they still don't like their picture. Why?
Because the [reversible] condition is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness.
So here's the final piece of this experiment.

We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say, "You know, we're doing a photography course, and we can do it one of two ways.
A whirlpool, for Steve Grand, is a thing with just as much reality as a rock.
In a desert plain in Tanzania, in the shadow of the volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai, there's a dune made of volcanic ash.
The beautiful thing is that it moves bodily. It's what's technically known as a "barchan," and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about 17 meters per year.
The world model that a bat needs in order to navigate through three dimensions catching insects must be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird -- a day-flying bird like a swallow -- needs to perform the same kind of tasks.
The fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model, while the swallow uses light, is incidental.
Bats, I've even suggested, use perceived hues, such as red and blue, as labels, internal labels, for some useful aspect of echoes -- perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces, furry or smooth and so on -- in the same way as swallows or indeed, we, use those perceived hues -- redness and blueness, etc. -- to label long and short wavelengths of light.

There's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength.
We could make a similar scale of improbabilities; nothing is totally impossible.
Miracles are just events that are extremely improbable.
A marble statue could wave its hand at us; the atoms that make up its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway.
A marble statue could wave its hand at us; the atoms that make up its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway.
Because there are so many of them, and because there's no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement, the marble, as we see it in Middle World, stays rock steady.
But the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time, and again and again.
We don't know how many planets there are in the universe, but a good estimate is about 10 to the 20, or 100 billion billion.
And that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life's improbability.
We could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability, which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at.
If life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe, that planet has to be our planet, because here we are talking about it.
And that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it, we're allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life which have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion.
I don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that, because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe.
That's not what we say.
What we say -- and I include the most austerely mechanistic among us, which is probably me -- what we say is, "Vile monster, prison is too good for you."
Or worse, we seek revenge, in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge, which we see, of course, all over the world today.

We are evolved to second-guess the behavior of others by becoming brilliant, intuitive psychologists.
Treating people as machines may be scientifically and philosophically accurate, but it's a cumbersome waste of time if you want to guess what this person is going to do next.
The economically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful, goal-seeking agent with pleasures and pains, desires and intentions, guilt, blame-worthiness.
And so, you tell them your theory and they say, "No, no, that's not the way consciousness is!
No, you've got it all wrong."
And they say this with an amazing confidence.
I think everybody understands what that means.
That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness.
This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done.
It's a Saul Steinberg of course -- it was a New Yorker cover.
And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque.
That reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle, Suzanne R. -- he's off to the races.
'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.' 'Real magic,' in other words, refers to the magic that is not real; while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic."
Now, that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness.
Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks.
And you say, "Yes, and how does he do that?"
He says, "Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry."
So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness.
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's.
And I love paintings like that -- the painting is actually about as big as it is right here.
And I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail, and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting.
See, when you get close they're really just blobs of paint.
You will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect.
I'll just give that to you one more time.
I don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done?
Well, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady?
It's the same thing.
The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there.
You think the detail's there, but it isn't there.
The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all.
Let's just do this experiment very quickly.
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated?
Yes.
Harvard Medical School once -- I was at a talk -- director of the lab said, "In our lab, we have a saying.
If you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience.
If you work on two neurons, that's psychology."
But anyway, it's just great to see such a full theater, and really I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation.  One of the interesting things, of course, is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology, and of course what he said about listening to our young people.
Of course, my job is all about listening, and my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen.
That's my only real aim in life.
We have to listen to ourselves, first of all.
If I play, for example, holding the stick -- where literally I do not let go of the stick -- you'll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm.
And you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- detached from the instrument and from the stick, even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly.
And I just couldn't quite accept that.
And so therefore, I said to them, "Well, look, if you refuse -- if you refuse me through those reasons, as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -- then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept."
And as a result -- once we got over a little hurdle, and having to audition twice -- they accepted me. And not only that -- what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom.
The tiniest, softest, softest sound to something that is so broad, so huge, so incredible! There's always something -- it may sound good up there, may not be so good there.
May be great there, but terrible up there.
Maybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc.
For me, as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music, it's very easy for me to say, "Oh yes, I like that piece.
Oh no, I don't like that piece." And so on.
And you know, I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time.
And instead of him saying, "OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart, arms at a more-or-less 90 degree angle, sticks in a more-or-less V shape, keep this amount of space here, etc.
Please keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc." -- where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid, frozen, and I would not be able to strike the drum, because I was thinking of so many other things -- he said, "Evelyn, take this drum away for seven days, and I'll see you next week."
So, heavens! What was I to do? I no longer required the sticks; I wasn't allowed to have these sticks.

So, heavens! What was I to do? I no longer required the sticks; I wasn't allowed to have these sticks.
I had to basically look at this particular drum, see how it was made, what these little lugs did, what the snares did.
This is a bird.
What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind and then label it and sell it to children?
I think we have a design problem.
So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility, reflect on this -- it took us 5,000 years to put wheels on our luggage.
So, as Kevin Kelly pointed out, there is no endgame.
There is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game.
Does it work? Do I like it?
We're adding the Jeffersonian agenda, and I come from Charlottesville, where I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson.
We're adding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Now if we look at the word "competition," I'm sure most of you've used it.
But if we look at asphalt as our growth, then we realize that all we're doing is destroying the planetary's fundamental underlying operating system.
So when we see E equals mc squared come along, from a poet's perspective, we see energy as physics, chemistry as mass, and all of a sudden, you get this biology.
And we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem, but the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge, we will never be able to recover that.
And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry.
With the electric industry you actually have to -- one of them is that they're both sort of thin, horizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries.
It's not a specific thing.
With the electric industry you actually have to -- one of them is that they're both sort of thin, horizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries.

But electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.

But electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.
You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.
The Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric, which became General Electric, paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive.
But that is not the -- and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web.
Because, remember, the Web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network.
But that is not the -- and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web.
Because, remember, the Web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network.
So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure -- I'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994, when it was growing 2,300 percent a year.
This is the clean rinse-water. So you'd take the clothes out of here, put them in here, and then you'd run the clothes through this electric ringer.
And this was a big deal.
You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain.
And that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation, because they hadn't invented the off switch.
That was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances -- because it didn't make any sense.
I mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket.
That was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances -- because it didn't make any sense.
I mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket.
So you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it.
That's what you did. You didn't turn it off.
And as I said before, they hadn't invented the electric outlet either, so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device.
And there are -- when you research this, there are gruesome descriptions of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices.


That splendid music, the coming-in music, "The Elephant March" from "Aida," is the music I've chosen for my funeral.
The only slight jarring note was when Jeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang, "the most splendid creatures that God put on this earth."
Now of course, we know that he didn't really mean that, but in this country at the moment, you can't be too careful.
I'm a biologist, and the central theorem of our subject: the theory of design, Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.

In professional circles everywhere, it's of course universally accepted.

In professional circles everywhere, it's of course universally accepted.
In non-professional circles outside America, it's largely ignored.
In an audience as sophisticated as this one, that would be preaching to the choir.
No, what I want to urge upon you --  Instead, what I want to urge upon you is militant atheism.
But that's putting it too negatively.
This argument of course, shoots itself in the foot.
Any designer capable of designing something really complex has to be even more complex himself, and that's before we even start on the other things he's expected to do, like forgive sins, bless marriages, listen to prayers -- favor our side in a war --  disapprove of our sex lives, and so on.
Complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve, and you can't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex, thereby simply compounding the problem.

Complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve, and you can't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex, thereby simply compounding the problem.
Darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity.
But here, I only want to make the point that the elegance of Darwinism is corrosive to religion, precisely because it is so elegant, so parsimonious, so powerful, so economically powerful.
It has the sinewy economy of a beautiful suspension bridge.
The God theory is not just a bad theory.
So, we're used to not challenging religious ideas, and it's very interesting how much of a furor Richard creates when he does it." -- He meant me, not that one.
"Everybody gets absolutely frantic about it, because you're not allowed to say these things. Yet when you look at it rationally, there's no reason why those ideas shouldn't be as open to debate as any other, except that we've agreed somehow between us that they shouldn't be." And that's the end of the quote from Douglas.
In my view, not only is science corrosive to religion; religion is corrosive to science.

In my view, not only is science corrosive to religion; religion is corrosive to science.
It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations, and blinds them to the wonderful, real explanations that we have within our grasp.
In practice, what is an atheist?
An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf.
As has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.
I think the best of the available alternatives for "atheist" is simply "non-theist."
It lacks the strong connotation that there's definitely no God, and it could therefore easily be embraced by teapot or tooth-fairy agnostics.
It's completely compatible with the God of the physicists.
We need an anti-Templeton to step forward.
If my books sold as well as Stephen Hawking's books, instead of only as well as Richard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself.
People are always going on about, "How did September the 11th change you?"
And if the -- if the conference is anywhere near this distressing, then we're going to have a scream bag next year.
It's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag, of course.
So you're going to be able to go like this.
Now let's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device.
I'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters, and then I'll show it to you in person.
First of all, it needs to be small.
OK, so, Einstein, what's your favorite singing group?
Could you say that again? What's your favorite singing group?
OK, one more time -- I'm just going to give you a little help.
I tried to make it a little bit clearer.
Is it the Virgin Mary?
Or is it Mena Trott?
Is it the Virgin Mary?
Or is it Mena Trott?
So, I talked to Josh Prince-Ramus about the convention center and the conferences. It's getting awfully big.
A few years later, there's no snow left at all.
And all the trees have turned brown.
This year, unfortunately the lakebed's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed.
And yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking.
And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that, keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here.
So you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture, and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass.
What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass?
What's in it for the ant?
And the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant.
Yeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke.
It's a little brain worm.
It's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle.
Richard Dawkins, whom you'll be hearing later in the day, invented the term "memes," and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book "The Selfish Gene."
Now here am I talking about his idea.
Well, you see, it's not his. Yes -- he started it.
It makes it a really fun place to work.
Along with our logos, too, which I think really embody our culture when we change things.
In the early days, we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand, you know, because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.
In the early days, we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand, you know, because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.
You want it to be consistent.
And we said, "Well, that doesn't sound so much fun.
Because you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google, and you expect an answer back, right?
But finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.
And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.
But finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.
And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.
It would be artificial intelligence.
And then, you know, he got even more mad, and he wrote -- like, started swearing and so on.
And then we produced "You suck."
And finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass."

And then we produced "You suck."
And finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass."
The outstanding -- the salient problem about this for us is that these are places that are not worth caring about.
We're going to talk about that some more.
A sense of place: your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings, and to employ the vocabularies, grammars, syntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecture in order to inform us who we are.
And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design.
This is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principle that we threw in the garbage after World War II and decided we don't need that anymore; we're not going to use it.
And consequently, we can see the result all around us.

And consequently, we can see the result all around us.
The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically, but it has to inform us where we are in our culture.
And I want you to think about that when you think about those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq, spilling their blood in the sand, and ask yourself, "What is their last thought of home?"
I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for.  We need better places in this country.
Public space. This is a good public space.

That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations -- things go in and out of it. It's permeable.
This is the back of Boston City Hall, the most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany -- excuse me -- in Boston.
And what is the message that is coming, what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building and how is it informing us about who we are?
This, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein, and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building, because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.
You can see exactly what went on, three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting.
You know, eight hours before deadline, four architects trying to get this building in on time, right?
And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings, and the renderings, and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and -- I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there?  Because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting.
It's not civically rich enough for them to go down there.
OK.
The pattern of Main Street USA -- in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.
The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it: To spatially denote the pedestrian realm, to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway, to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk, and to soften the hardscape of the buildings and to create a ceiling -- a vaulted ceiling -- over the street, at its best.
And that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees.
They're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods; they're not supposed to be a set for "The Last of the Mohicans."
And believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then, so it really was a form of country living.
But what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 years and it turns into something rather insidious.
It becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country.

And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.
And that meant actually designing custom technology So, there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags: there's RF tags on the user, on the cards, there's the staff devices that are all around the store.
You pick them up, and once you see something that you're interested in, the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store.
You can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever.
DK: And of course: a hammock for your afternoon nap that stretches across your cubicle.
DK: This next project, we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London.
The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it, as well as wastewater.
You can see: there's the plant.
These are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes.
And we're announcing a new product here tonight, which is the first time this has ever been shown in public.
These are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes.
And we're announcing a new product here tonight, which is the first time this has ever been shown in public.
It's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye, started by Nigel Jagger in London.
You throw it over the side of your boat and you basically scuba dive without getting wet.
For us -- there's the object -- for us, it was two projects. One, to design the interface so that the interface doesn't get in your way.
You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater -- of feeling like you're underwater -- seeing what's going on.
And the other one was to design the object and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool.
And so we spent a lot of time -- this has been going on for about seven or eight years, this project -- and [we're] just ready to start building them.
(Narrator: The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera.

It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep.
We're curious, and we just go out and get knowledge, you know?
Why do we study ants? Well, it's interesting.
Maybe we'll learn something really useful about it, but it's interesting and fascinating.
Why do we study ants? Well, it's interesting.
Maybe we'll learn something really useful about it, but it's interesting and fascinating.
But sometimes, a science has some other attributes which makes it really, really interesting.
Some people say, brains can't understand brains.
Very Zen-like. Whoo.  You know, it sounds good, but why? I mean, what's the point?
It's just a bunch of cells. You understand your liver.
It just turns out it's really hard to think of things, but once you've thought of them, it's kind of easy to understand it.
My daughters understood these three theories in their basic framework by the time they were in kindergarten.
And now it's not that hard, you know, here's the apple, here's the orange, you know, the Earth goes around, that kind of stuff.
My daughters understood these three theories in their basic framework by the time they were in kindergarten.
And now it's not that hard, you know, here's the apple, here's the orange, you know, the Earth goes around, that kind of stuff.
Finally, another thing is the answer was there all along, but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing, and that's the thing.
And I'm going to work you through this in a few slides here, give you an example of what this means. Here's a system.
Engineers like to look at systems like this. Scientists like to look at systems like this.
They say, well, we have a thing in a box, and we have its inputs and its outputs.
And then, what I'm saying is, is that the eternal prediction is the output in the neocortex.
And that somehow, prediction leads to intelligent behavior.
And here's how that happens. Let's start with a non-intelligent brain.
And here's how that happens. Let's start with a non-intelligent brain.
Well I'll argue a non-intelligent brain, we got hold of an old brain, and we're going to say it's like a non-mammal, like a reptile, so I'll say, an alligator; we have an alligator.
And the alligator has some very sophisticated senses.
Well I'll argue a non-intelligent brain, we got hold of an old brain, and we're going to say it's like a non-mammal, like a reptile, so I'll say, an alligator; we have an alligator.
And the alligator has some very sophisticated senses.
It's got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on, a mouth and a nose. It has very complex behavior.
And the alligator has some very sophisticated senses.
It's got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on, a mouth and a nose. It has very complex behavior.
It can run and hide. It has fears and emotions. It can eat you, you know.
It can run and hide. It has fears and emotions. It can eat you, you know.
It can attack. It can do all kinds of stuff.
But we don't consider the alligator very intelligent, not like in a human sort of way.
No, really, that's what it is. It's about the size of a table napkin.
And it doesn't fit, so it gets all wrinkly. Now look at how I've drawn this here.
The old brain is still there. You still have that alligator brain.
And on top of it, we have this memory system called the neocortex.
And the memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain.
And so as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain, it also goes up into the neocortex. And the neocortex is just memorizing.
It's sitting there saying, ah, I'm going to memorize all the things that are going on: where I've been, people I've seen, things I've heard, and so on.
And in the future, when it sees something similar to that again, so in a similar environment, or the exact same environment, it'll play it back. It'll start playing it back.
Oh, I've been here before. And when you've been here before, this happened next. It allows you to predict the future.
I already said the word "sentence." In music, if you've heard a song before, if you heard Jill sing those songs before, when she sings them, the next note pops into your head already -- you anticipate it as you're going. If it was an album of music, the end of one album, the next song pops into your head.
And these things happen all the time. You're making these predictions.
I have this thing called the altered door thought experiment.
And when you go home tonight, you're going to put your hand out there, and you're going to reach for the doorknob and you're going to notice it's in the wrong spot, and you'll go, whoa, something happened.
It may take a second to figure out what it was, but something happened.
Now I could change your doorknob in other ways.
It may take a second to figure out what it was, but something happened.
Now I could change your doorknob in other ways.
I can make it larger or smaller, I can change its brass to silver, I could make it a lever. I can change your door, put colors on; I can put windows in. I can change a thousand things about your door, and in the two seconds you take to open your door, you're going to notice that something has changed.
Door, door, door, you know, color, you know what I'm saying.
We don't do that. Your brain doesn't do that.
What your brain is doing is making constant predictions all the time about what is going to happen in your environment.
We don't do that. Your brain doesn't do that.
What your brain is doing is making constant predictions all the time about what is going to happen in your environment.
As I put my hand on this table, I expect to feel it stop.
It's not like you just look over there and say, what am I seeing now?
A nose, that's okay. No, you have an expectation of what you're going to see.
Every single moment. And finally, let's think about how we test intelligence.
What's the fourth one? That's how we test it. It's all about prediction.
So what is the recipe for brain theory?
First of all, we have to have the right framework.
So I found the best people to work with are physicists, engineers and mathematicians, who tend to think algorithmically.
Then they have to learn the anatomy, and they've got to learn the physiology.
You have to make these theories very realistic in anatomical terms.
It's very, very different. And it's a memory of these very high-dimensional patterns, like the things that come from your eyes.
It's also memory of sequences.
You cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence.
A song must be heard in sequence over time, and you must play it back in sequence over time.
And these sequences are auto-associatively recalled, so if I see something, I hear something, it reminds me of it, and then it plays back automatically.
It's an automatic playback. And prediction of future inputs is the desired output.
A song must be heard in sequence over time, and you must play it back in sequence over time.

And these sequences are auto-associatively recalled, so if I see something, I hear something, it reminds me of it, and then it plays back automatically.
It's an automatic playback. And prediction of future inputs is the desired output.
And as I said, the theory must be biologically accurate, it must be testable, and you must be able to build it.

I'd like to start tonight by something completely different, asking you to join me by stepping off the land and jumping into the open ocean for a moment.
90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean, and it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.
And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.
And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola, whose primary prey are jellyfish.
This animal is in "The Guinness World Book of Records" for being the world's heaviest bony fish.
Well, not the one we tagged!
And everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone, to the fin muscle to -- I think that ís pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten.
So the hardest part of tagging, now, is after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.
All the time when they talk about it you immediately think about Africa.
That's the image: African countries. But let me say this: if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London -- if the other people who had taken money, estimated at 20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this, what is that? Is that not corruption?
In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?
And with the support of a leader who was willing, at the time, to do the reforms, we put forward a comprehensive reform program, which we developed ourselves.
Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank, where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.
No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.
Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank, where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.
No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.
We put together a program that would, one: get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.
We -- as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.
Can you believe that prior to this reform -- which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington to go and take up the post of Finance Minister -- we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop 4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?
Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.
And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.
That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left, 27 billion dollars. Whereas -- and this went to our reserves -- when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.
By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances.
I could go on giving examples: Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her.
However, many of these are starved for capital to expand, because nobody believes outside of our countries that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market.
Nobody thinks there's opportunity.
So, we went around the table to talk about what we should do.
The conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary.
She said, "I agree with everything that's been said.
Well, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now is to make it clear in Sacramento, California that we need a market-based system of mandates that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California.
It's necessary and, just as important, it's good for the California economy.
So, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32.
That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain and optimize them along the way.
So, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels.
I guess that's better living through bugs.
So, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels.

Alan Kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Does anybody here have an answer for him? I don't.
We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations make the right outcome, the profitable outcome, and therefore the likely outcome.
Energy's a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide.
So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today?
And so then he looks at me.
So I said, "Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity," was all I could think of. What is virtue?
And so then he looks at me.
So I said, "Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity," was all I could think of. What is virtue?
But of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion is that it is more fun.
So then you decide, "Well, I'm sick of myself.
I'm going to think of how other people can be happy.
I'm going to get up in the morning and think, what can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat, my pet, my butterfly?"
Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers.
I mean it's point and click, it's like the menus, icons, it's all the kind of same thing.
And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk.
I just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way.
Also some of the stuff we can do is, for these individual icons we thought -- I mean, how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further?
And one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important.
But what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this, it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move but if I throw it at the lighter guys, right?
So it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right?
This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool.
Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life?
So Virtual Earth is about starting off creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world.
What we want to do is mix in all types of data.
But let me tell you -- it doesn't affect his day job.
We think a lot of good can come from this technology.
This was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone.
I can get the next image. I can blend and transition.
By doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact, I might be recording history.
The freshness, the capacity. I can turn this image.
Things are changing and today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page, it says, by first of May, full access to the databases.
And if I could share the image with you on the screen.
So three things have happened.
And this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.
And the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama, you see the family still sitting on the floor there.
Although there is a sofa, if you watch in the kitchen, you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.
All these things are important for development, especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare.
Now, what we need to think about is, what is a goal for development, and what are the means for development?
Let me first grade what are the most important means.
Now what about goals? Where are we going toward?
We are not interested in money.
Money is not a goal.
Now what about goals? Where are we going toward?
We are not interested in money.
Money is not a goal.
I showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint, and I think I will convince you also by culture.
Bring me my sword!
Sword swallowing is from ancient India.
It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.
And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible by taking this piece of steel -- solid steel -- this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850, in the last year we had war.
And it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.
Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight.
When you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months, with a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150.
And a lot of people ask me, you know, what kind of people do you get for a project like this?
Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous.
We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.
Along that same line, I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year, we have never seen monsters underground -- at least the kind that eat you.
For those who have never seen this story, Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie couple of years ago, called "Aliens of the Deep."
There was a brief clip --  Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa would be the ultimate robotic challenge.
Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light, it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.
There are two primary targets we're doing here.
One is, how do you do science autonomy underground?
How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?
Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.
So, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price?
There is a place where you can.
In fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower if you can find propellant on the moon.
There is a little-known mission that was launched by the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine.
And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon.
If you try to do that for the moon, you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there.
But if you send a mining team there, without the return propellant, first --  Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?
This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.
But if you send a mining team there, without the return propellant, first --  Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?
This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.
I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it so we're not going to burn the gear.
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue.
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand.
But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important, is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression, and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom.
Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.
Today, with diabetes, what do we do?
Today, with diabetes, what do we do?
We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic, and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.
Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually face the regeneration of that limb.
It's a wild concept.
I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.
Secondly, we can use materials.
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.
If we can invent materials, design materials, or extract materials from a natural environment, then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.
And finally, we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.
I'm going to show you an example of each of these, and I'm going to start with materials.
Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh -- about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig, if you threw away all the cells, and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active, may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself.
And he asked a very important question.
He asked the question, if I take that material, which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine, and I place it somewhere else on a person's body, would it give a tissue-specific response, or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?
And this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer, that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.
That's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.
That material contained only natural signals.
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.
So we think, first and foremost, AIDS is a policy issue.
And probably for most people in this room, that's how you think about it.
But this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic.
It's going to be about thinking about how it evolves, and how people respond to it.
I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff, which is really the most important, but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude that we actually cannot develop effective policy unless we really understand how the epidemic works.
And the first thing that I want to talk about, the first thing I think we need to understand is: how do people respond to the epidemic?
So if you combine the intuition in this figure with some of the data that I talked about before, it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent of the decline in prevalence in Uganda actually would have happened even without any education campaign.
But that's enormously important for policy.
We're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign.
Other views are also available.
Here are gender, age, weather, location.
The final movement is called Mounds.
And this is a technique that I explored in a different project, the Yahoo! Time Capsule, which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.
It was divided into ten very simple themes -- love, anger, sadness and so on -- each of which contained a single, very open-ended question put to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?
What makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.
It was divided into ten very simple themes -- love, anger, sadness and so on -- each of which contained a single, very open-ended question put to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?
What makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.
The time capsule was available for one month online, translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.
This is about as big as they get, about a meter across.
And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes -- so this is about 10,000 worker ants -- changes as a function of colony age, in years.
So it starts out with zero ants, just the founding queen, and it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five.
That is, to send more winged queens and males to that year's mating flight.
And I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age because I've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants.  So that's not the most fun part of this research, although it's interesting.
Really the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation.
When extra food becomes available -- and this is what everybody knows about picnics -- then extra ants are allocated to collect the food.
So, with nobody telling anybody what to do, how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task?
And that's the process that I call task allocation.
So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand, put it down, turn around, and go back in.
And finally, the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage.
So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse.
There's the larvae, and they consume most of the food.
And this is true of most ants -- that the ants you see walking around don't do much eating.
They bring it back and feed it to the larvae.
There's the larvae, and they consume most of the food.
And this is true of most ants -- that the ants you see walking around don't do much eating.
They bring it back and feed it to the larvae.
And what I've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact.
So anybody who's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae.
They smell with their antennae.
This is taken through a fiber optics microscope. It's down inside the nest.
In the beginning you see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope.
But the idea is that the ants are in there, and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it -- a stream of contacts with other ants.
You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these.
Each ant, then, as it comes back in, is contacting other ants.
And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip, are contacting the ants coming in.
Each ant, then, as it comes back in, is contacting other ants.
And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip, are contacting the ants coming in.
So, what's interesting about this system is that it's messy.
So really, at this part of the game, what we're doing is we're running around and surviving, and also getting to the next generation, because we're going to play through every generation of this creature.
We can mate, so I'm going to see if one of these creatures wants to mate with me. Yeah.
We didn't want to replay actual evolution with humans and all that, because it's almost more interesting to look at alternate possibilities in evolution.
But really the goal here was, within about a minute, I wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create.
OK, now I'll put some hands on it.
OK, so here I've basically thrown together a little creature.
OK, so here I've basically thrown together a little creature.
Let me give it a little weapon on the tail here, so it can fight.
OK, so that's the complete model. Now we can actually go to the painting phase.
Let me give it a little weapon on the tail here, so it can fight.
OK, so that's the complete model. Now we can actually go to the painting phase.
Now, at this phase, the program actually has some understanding of the topology of this creature. It kind of knows where the backbone is, where the spine, the limbs are.
And so we're procedurally generating the texture map, and this is something a texture artist would take many, many days to work on.
And then we can test it out, once we've done that, and see how it would move around.
And so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature.
So far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here.
Now, at this point we're actually dealing with a very little toy planet.
Almost, again, like the Montessori toy idea.
Once we figure out all that's going on -- and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on -- once we figure out what's going on, we're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health, with what we do with future generations, and how long we're going to live.
And hopefully we'll be able to use this to discover more truth, and more beauty.
But it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines, are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.
This short fiction piece by Martin Amis starts out, "On September 11, 2001, he opened his eyes at 4 a.m. in Portland, Maine, and Mohamed Atta's last day began."
For a time that I find to be the most placid and uneventful hour of the day, four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press --  across a lot of different media from a lot of big names.
And it made me suspicious.
My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out because as we worked between one and four in the morning on Inauguration Day, I was still changing it."
Sure you were, because you've prepared your entire life for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you.
And then --  three paragraphs later we get this little beauty: "We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time.
An African economy can be broken up into three sectors.
There is the modern sector, there is the informal sector and the traditional sector.
The modern sector is the abode of the elites.
The modern sector is the abode of the elites.
It's the seat of government.
In many African countries the modern sector is lost.
They don't take any orders from their chiefs.
They decide what to do.
And when they produce their crops, they sell the surplus on marketplaces.
A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed.
It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians.
It also means that he will be able to generate wealth.
How are we using it?
Is it being directed effectively?
I want to tell you a little story.
And then we can see that this is one combination of private, international, multilateral money, private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership, so that aid can be a facilitator.
That is all aid can be.
Aid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that.
WK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book, it has got four -- ah -- three blades, and mine has got four blades.
CA: The book had three, yours had four.
WK: Yeah.
What materials did you use?
WK: I use a bicycle frame, and a pulley, and plastic pipe, what then pulls -- CA: Do we have a picture of that? Can we have the next slide?
WK: Yeah. The windmill.

CA: And so, and that windmill, what -- it worked?
And there we worked with leading CEOs on African issues, and African companies on turnarounds, making the companies not just the best in Africa but the best globally.
But I really formalized this focus on turnarounds when I was completing my MBA in the United States.
It all began with a fantastic phone call.
I'm sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the Healthcare Development Conference.
And I see the same picture, but from the opposite side.
A satellite picture looking down at the earth.
These are the trends that are taking place.
But in any investment decision, the key question is, "What is my alternative investment?"
Because in Africa today, we are competing globally for capital.
My friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world: those who can count, and those who can't.
He also says that the cause of all our trouble is the belief in an essential, pure identity: religious, ethnic, historical, ideological.
I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa that speaks to transformation.

In my economics classes I got high marks for my understanding of basic economics.
But I learned something more profound than that, which is that the leaders -- the managers of Ghana's economy -- were making breathtakingly bad decisions that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse.
And so here was this lesson again -- leadership matters.
And it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way.
I am thinking now.
This year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves.
One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart.
Can we create a perfect society?
Her understanding that a student-crafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible.
I was too young, unmarried, I had no children, didn't really know Africa, and besides, my French was pitiful.
And so, it was an incredibly painful time in my life, and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening.
I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well, so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda, and I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986, to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there.
And so I started looking around, and I heard about a bakery that was run by 20 prostitutes.
And, being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group, and what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to survive.
And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language, and how what we call people so often distances us from them, and makes them little.
And she said, "Nothing." And I said, "What?"
And she said, "Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green." And --  -- I learned then that listening isn't just about patience, but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long, it's really hard to say what you mean.
And, mostly because people never really ask you, and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.


I’d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa -- those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid.
We have civil wars only in six countries, which means that the media are covering only six countries.
Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to its audience.
But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.
Many countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.
To get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education, primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.
If the government's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people, such a government is driven by self-interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion.
It will sit with those who create wealth.
Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from them.
The problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in Africa.
The IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens, and therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid, is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.
But I want to put a caveat on my argument, and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive.
Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.
Now, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?
You know, in a dictionary?  Yeah, that's what I thought.
How about this word?
Here, I'll show it to you.
Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.
Notice -- we're very specific -- that word "compile."
But computers don't do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries.
They don't change the end result.
Because what a dictionary is, is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.
She says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!"
So they call grandma, and grandma says, "My pan was too small!"  So, it's not that we have good words and bad words.
We have a pan that's too small!
When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think, "This must be a bad word." Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.
Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?
So, you can't get a smaller ham.
No. There will still be paper dictionaries.
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation, we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.
You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries, but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.
They're just the right tools for the job.
And so people say to me, "How do I know if a word is real?"
You know, anybody who's read a children's book knows that love makes things real.
If you love a word, use it. That makes it real.
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.
It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.
It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.
If you love a word, it becomes real.
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic, if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less about control and more about description, then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile.

And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes, is touched, any time you touch a word, you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation, you verb it, you make the mobile move.

And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great?
So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now, but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.
They show the word, but they don't show any context.

Where did it come from? Who said it?
It dies too fast.
So, this whole time I've been saying, "The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary."
Not "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because, well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.
If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.
We can put in all the meanings.
Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?
The axis of a wheel stays on the same level, and this hip is staying on the same level as well.
In fact, this is better than a wheel, because when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach, you will notice it's very hard to do.
And the feet just step over the sand, and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in-between.

During the twentieth century, we witnessed the atrocities of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Rwanda and other genocides, and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old, we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horrors of Iraq.
This has led to a common understanding of our situation, namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence, and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from, to our peril.
Here is an example from an op-ed on Thanksgiving, in the Boston Globe a couple of years ago, where the writer wrote, "The Indian life was a difficult one, but there were no employment problems, community harmony was strong, substance abuse unknown, crime nearly non-existent, what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter." Now, you're all familiar with this treacle.
Life becomes an episode of "The Sopranos." Hobbes' solution, the "Leviathan," was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency -- a leviathan -- then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack, because any kind of aggression will be punished, leaving its profitability as zero. That would remove the temptation to invade preemptively, out of fear of them attacking you first.
It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible. And therefore, it would lead to a state of peace. Eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide -- argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe coincided with the rise of centralized states.
So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory.
The World Wide Web, the French are told, ought to be referred to as "la toile d'araignee mondiale" -- the Global Spider Web -- recommendations that the French gaily ignore.
Now, this is one model of how language comes to be: namely, it's legislated by an academy.
But anyone who looks at language realizes that this is a rather silly conceit, that language, rather, emerges from human minds interacting from one another.
Let me start off with a technical problem in language that I've worried about for quite some time -- and indulge me in my passion for verbs and how they're used.
The problem is, which verbs go in which constructions?
The verb is the chassis of the sentence.
How are these construals reflected in language?
Well, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affected is expressed as the direct object, the noun after the verb.
So, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere -- where you're doing something to the muffin -- you say, "Give the muffin to the mouse."
But I want to show you a different approach, and this is this robot over here, which has four legs.
It has eight motors, four on the knees and four on the hip.
It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine which way it's tilting.
It has eight motors, four on the knees and four on the hip.
It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine which way it's tilting.
But this machine doesn't know what it looks like.
This is the last cycle, and you can see it's pretty much figured out what its self looks like. And once it has a self-model, it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion.
So what you're seeing here are a couple of machines -- a pattern of locomotion.
We were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil, spidery walk, but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward.
So what you're seeing here are a couple of machines -- a pattern of locomotion.
We were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil, spidery walk, but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward.
But when you look at that, you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward, nor did it have a model of itself.
They begin to self-replicate. So in absence of any reward, the intrinsic reward is self-replication.
And we've actually built a couple of these, and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes.
It's an accelerated view, where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process.

So, I don't know how much civilization really has progressed since AD 79, but there's a great likelihood. I really believe this, and I don't believe in aliens, and I don't believe there are any aliens on the Earth or anything like that. But there's a likelihood that we will confront a civilization that is more intelligent than our own.
Now, what will happen? What if they come to, you know, suck up our oceans for the hydrogen?
And swat us away like flies, the way we swat away flies when we go into the rainforest and start logging it.
Somewhere in the Amazon forest is the marginal tree.
You cut down that tree, the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem.
There's really a tree like that out there. That's really what it comes to.
It's one of my favorite ones, because we've done several stories on Bt corn.
Bt corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer.
You may of heard of it -- heard it called StarLink, especially when all those taco shells were taken out of the supermarkets about a year and a half ago.
We've all learned what -- the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head, like anthrax.
The worst possibility is that a very simple germ, like staph, for which we have one antibiotic that still works, mutates.
And we know staph can do amazing things.
And also, space is incredibly vast.
So even if you flung a million of these things out of orbit, the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote.
But it only has to get close, about a billion miles away, one of these things.
Astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years.
In 1989, a large asteroid passed 400,000 miles away from Earth.
Nothing to worry about, right?
Here is a close-up of the fossil, after five years of cleaning, preparation and description, which was very long, as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block I just showed you in the previous slide.
It took five years.
In a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years, but the labor was very long.
And here is full scale -- it's a tiny bone.
And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism, who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there.
And you see me worried and trying to protect my child, because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child, even a minister.
It's, in a way, your voice box.
It determines the type of voice you produce.
It was not known in the fossil record, and we have it in this skeleton.
Hollywood gathers around power tables, and the Valley gathers around power tables.
So it turned out there was a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
But I'm actually here today to tell a story.
I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.
And after we saw his slide show, it became clear that it was much more urgent.
And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David, and Davis Guggenheim, who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.
And I really thought this was going to be a straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.
And so it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest, and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland, and most of Scandinavia.
We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.
And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner," based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.
And we think once people see these films, they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world and the Middle East in general.
We premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.

Three years ago, I got a phone call, based on an earlier film I had made, with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard.
My idea -- and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night, and we've all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep -- I was excited, with this phone call.
I started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars.
Gave them about a nine minute response, and there we went.
So, I'd like to show the clip of the film.
We were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software.
Right? And we started talking.
People will see my tag, and they'll see "The War Tapes," and then we'll start talking about war.
I didn't save all of them, because I didn't realize at the beginning that it would be something that I would want to keep track of.
But there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messages that I was able to save.
The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it.
So you get to experience that in real time, right?
The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did within 24 hours of that episode happening.
Steve Pink reading his journal happened five months after he came home.
We like to have technology make us feel bad, for some strange reason.
But I really like that, so I wrote a book called "The Laws of Simplicity."
I was in Milan last week, for the Italian launch.
That's my baby Reina.  Thank you.
And so, my life is much more complex because of the baby, actually, but that's okay. We will still stay married, I think.
But looking way back, when I was a child -- you see, I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.
We were a great model. So, I loved going to school.
School was great, and maybe going to school helped me get to this Media Lab place, I'm not sure.
Thank you.
If you dry them quick, you can make, like, elephants and steers and stuff, and my wife didn't like these, because they mold, so I had to stop that.
So, I went back to the computer, and I bought five large fries, and scanned them all. And I was looking for some kind of food theme, and I wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images.
And as a child, I'd hear that song, you know, "Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain," so I made this amber waves image.
It's a bit eerie, isn't it?
So, I thought, maybe I'll do this for the next twenty years or something.
And I wrote this book, "The Laws of Simplicity."
So, I thought, maybe I'll do this for the next twenty years or something.
And I wrote this book, "The Laws of Simplicity."
It's a very short, simple book. There are ten laws and three keys.
So the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work, encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here, where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight, you have a connection with nature.
And nature is part of the generator, the driver for this building.
And symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow.
And when the photograph was taken, it's word processors.
And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology.
We were fortunate, because in a way our building was future-proofed.
And here, if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria, the way in which now, with a computer, we can model the forces, we can see the high pressure, the low pressure, the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing.
So it also has the ability, all the time, regardless of the direction of the wind, to be able to make the building fresh and efficient.
And unlike conventional buildings, the top of the building is celebratory.
And unlike conventional buildings, the top of the building is celebratory.
It's a viewing place for people, not machinery.
And the base of the building is again about public space.
They do not have good enough infrastructure.
And if they had some infrastructure, they have difficulty maintaining it.
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car, looked up on Google, found a route into northern India from New Delhi which, you know, which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers, and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests, and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.
Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting, let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.
You put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.
So the principal looks at it and says, 3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.
And what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.
So it sort of raised more questions than it answered.
Is this real? Does the language matter, because he's not supposed to know English?
Is this real? Does the language matter, because he's not supposed to know English?
Will the computer last, or will they break it and steal it -- and did anyone teach them?
The last question is what everybody said, but you know, I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office, can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.
And if you tested him, he would answer every question correctly on that topic.
So, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly.
So what was the conclusion over the six years of work?
And learning is most likely a self-organizing system.
If you put all the four together, then it gives -- according to me -- it gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic, fault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.
And for a few thousand visits, I would see the same thing every time, the little differences in the Earth.
But this last time, just coming round, right now, suddenly, there'd be huge changes in the environment, in the concentration of people, and it was just unbelievable, the amount of -- all the change in it.
I wanted to -- well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago, we began using coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution, and 100 years ago, began getting gasoline from underground, with a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption, or production, will reach its limit in about ten years, and then go down, and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation.
As the sky gets darker, and the outside air temperatures drop below minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the most environmentally hostile segment of Helios's journey has gone by without notice, except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems and their associated sensors.
at 4:12 p.m., Helios is standing on top of 98 percent of the Earth's atmosphere.
This is more than 10,000 feet higher than the previous world's altitude record held by the SR-71 Blackbird.

PM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications, and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet.
PM: Okay, and let's have the next.
That plane is widely used by the military, now, in all their operations.
Let's have the next video.
PM: Okay, and let's have the next.

The idea is that it soars on the lift over your body, like a seagull soaring on a cliff.
As the wind comes up, it has to go over the cliff, so as you walk through the air, it goes around your body, some has to go over you.
And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.
And every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses that have never been charted, the genomic sequences of which we don't know.
Their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of, but we are ripe for zoonotic-borne, emerging communicable diseases.
Increasingly, I would say explosive growth of technology.
They're actively guiding their money, their resources, their hearts, their commitments, to make the world a better place.
Certainly, nothing can give you more optimism than that.
More reasons to be optimistic: in the '60s, and I am a creature of the '60s, there was a movement.


In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.
It has a very large, thick atmosphere, and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth, or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.
Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room, except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.
So like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what -- we didn't know what.
But this is what we suspected. And these molecules, especially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.
This is a device of human making, and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.
It is so significant that, in my mind, this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe, and sadly, that wasn't the case.
So, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines as you fly across the surface of Titan.  And then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface, and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen, the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.
And here is the horizon, OK?
These are probably water ice pebbles, yes?
It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.
So again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid, until finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.
CA: Have you met anyone interesting?
RB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting.
I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn, because I had an apology to make to her.
I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn, because I had an apology to make to her.
I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd -- she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.
And I went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why I had another woman's big, massive, big wedding ring on my finger.
CA: I mean, there are a few launches you've done where the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well.
I mean, Virgin Brides -- what happened there?
RB: We couldn't find any customers.
I mean, what are the numbers on this?
I mean, how big is the group overall?
How much -- what's the total revenue?
CA: I mean, it is a tough job.
When I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as well and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here, it's very strange.
RB: I know, I have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but -- CA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about -- RB: "Pammy" we launched, you know -- mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola, and we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy" and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson.
RB: I'll go get the secretary to use it.
CA: OK. So let's look at the space thing.
I think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to, and Virgin Galactic up in the air.  So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship?
And, I mean, first of all we -- nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before, so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream, and we weren't quite sure, when a balloon actually got into the jet stream, whether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there.
And so, just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic, as we were pushing into the jet stream, this enormous balloon -- the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour, the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour, and it just took off.
And it was like holding onto a thousand horses.
CA: And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that.
RB: Yeah. No, I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon, with my parachute, looking at the swirling clouds below, trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea, which -- and it was a very, very, very lonely few moments.
But, anyway, we managed to survive it.
And the balloon hit the sea and went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me.
But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and -- CA: What did you write to your family?
RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that: just I love you very much. And I'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which -- just in case anything had happened.
I work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happened and it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it.
And Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx, and somebody said Bronxistan, and somebody said Ferreristan, and we came up with this New Yorker cover, which we were able to -- we didn't know what we were doing.
We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be -- well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true.
And I didn't -- and I'd never used it in school, because I was too busy writing poems, and flunking out, and I don't know what, sitting in cafes.
But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought, this book is amazing.
I said, people should know about this book.
You get, now, a DNA stapler, instead.
These are the kind of molecular programs we want to be able to write.
The problem is, we don't know the machine language of proteins or have a compiler for proteins.
So I've joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using DNA. We use DNA because it's cheaper, it's easier to handle, it's something we understand really well -- so well, in fact, that we think we can actually write programming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers.
So then, we think we can do that.
One of my first questions doing this was: How can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA?
She's some other woman. She's an impostor."
It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain.
This has never made much sense to me, this argument.
It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain.
This has never made much sense to me, this argument.
It's very ingenious, as all Freudian arguments are --  -- but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion, a patient having the same delusion, about his pet poodle.
You look just like my mother." OK?
The reason is there's a separate pathway going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers, and that's not been cut by the accident.
So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother, no problem.
A subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that.
OK, now the next question is, what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments?
One of the things we've found was, about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom.
He knows that the arm is not there, but, nevertheless, it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient.
But however, about half the patients, this doesn't happen.
The phantom limb -- they'll say, "But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed.
But however, about half the patients, this doesn't happen.
The phantom limb -- they'll say, "But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed.
It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful.
Now, why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb?
When I looked at the case sheet, I found that they had an actual arm, and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut, and the actual arm had been paralyzed, and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation, and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself.
Why does this happen?
That's obvious, but the astonishing thing is, the patient then says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again, and the pain, the clenching spasm, is relieved."
And remember, my first patient who came in --  -- thank you.  My first patient came in, and he looked in the mirror, and I said, "Look at your reflection of your phantom."
And he started giggling, he says, "I can see my phantom."
And then I said, "Close your eyes."
He closes his eyes.
"And move your normal hand."
So, I said, "Look, Derek" -- well, first of all, the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain -- I said, "Look, Derek, take it home and practice with it for a week or two.
Maybe, after a period of practice, you can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis, and start moving your paralyzed arm, and then, relieve yourself of pain."
So he said OK, and he took it home.
Maybe, after a period of practice, you can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis, and start moving your paralyzed arm, and then, relieve yourself of pain."
So he said OK, and he took it home.
I said, "Look, it's, after all, two dollars. Take it home."
I said, "Look, it's, after all, two dollars. Take it home."
So, he took it home, and after two weeks, he phones me, and he said, "Doctor, you're not going to believe this."
I said, "What?"
He thought I was some kind of magician.
Now, why does this happen?
It's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict.
It's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back.
On the other hand, there's no proprioception, muscle signals saying that there is no arm, right?
And your motor command saying there is an arm, and, because of this conflict, the brain says, to hell with it, there is no phantom, there is no arm, right?
It goes into a sort of denial -- it gates the signals.
And when the arm disappears, the bonus is, the pain disappears because you can't have disembodied pain floating out there, in space.
So, that's the bonus.
OK, let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk, which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia.
This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century.
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin.
Secondly, synesthesia is about -- and this is what gets me to my point about the main theme of this lecture, which is about creativity -- synesthesia is eight times more common among artists, poets, novelists and other creative people than in the general population.
Why would that be?
I'm going to answer that question.
Why would that be?
I'm going to answer that question.
It's never been answered before.
Happiness is the freedom of choice.
The freedom to chose where to live, what to do, what to buy, what to sell, from whom, to whom, when and how.
Where does choice come from?
In fact, only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market.
Africa's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications, but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions, such as market information, grades and standards, and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers.
Because of this, commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles, in narrow networks of people they know and trust.
In fact, in 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves.
That was, of course, the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade, which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world.
The Chicago Board of Trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange.
That was, of course, the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade, which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world.

In the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market.

In the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market.
But once it arrived, if no buyer was to be found, or if prices suddenly dropped, farmers would incur tremendous losses.
Now, this is the picture I want you to focus on.
This is a picture of culture.
We could describe it using modern computer terminology as a kind of read-write culture.
This is a picture of culture.
We could describe it using modern computer terminology as a kind of read-write culture.
It's a culture where people participate in the creation and the re-creation of their culture. In that sense, it's read-write.
Never before in the history of human culture had it been as professionalized, never before as concentrated.
Never before has creativity of the millions been as effectively displaced, and displaced because of these, quote, "infernal machines."
The twentieth century was that century where, at least for those places we know the best, culture moved from this read-write to read-only existence.
We can only make them, quote, "pirates." And is that good?
We live in this weird time. It's kind of age of prohibitions, where in many areas of our life, we live life constantly against the law.
Ordinary people live life against the law, and that's what I -- we are doing to our kids.
♫ 'Cause I got all the answers ♫ ♫ right here on my screen. ♫ ♫ And I got all the answers, yeah. ♫ ♫ I got every book and magazine. ♫ ♫ I got all, I got all, I got all ... ♫ ♫ I got all the answers, ♫ ♫ all the answers, oh yeah. ♫ ♫ Uh-huh ... ♫ ♫ But I tell you what I'm going to do: ♫

Whew! It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song.
It was one of the titles that I was sort of thinking about calling my record, except there's a couple of problems.
One thing is, it's unpronounceable.
And it's a made-up word.
And the song is based on what I think was my first childhood attempts to think about invisible forces.
So "tembererana" was these dreams, in which I would be running away from bad feelings -- is the only way I can put it.
So this is called "Tembererana."
Well, along comes Benjamin Franklin, and he comes close to convulsing himself with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite.
And so people begin thinking in terms of electricity to produce convulsions.
And then, we fast-forward to about 1932, when three Italian psychiatrists, who were largely treating depression, began to notice among their patients, who were also epileptics, that if they had an epileptic -- a series of epileptic fits, a lot of them in a row -- the depression would very frequently lift.
But of course, having schizophrenia, within a few months, it returned.
But they wrote a paper about this, and everybody in the Western world began using electricity to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed.
It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics, but it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s that electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective in the treatment of depression.
In the late '70s, early '80s, there were others, and they were very effective.
And patients' rights groups seemed to get very upset about the kinds of things that they would witness.
And so the whole idea of electroconvulsive, electroshock therapy disappeared, but has had a renaissance in the last 10 years.
I brought my wife with me, actually, to make sure I could get through this.
My children came back to live with us.
We had two more children after that.
And they value that connectivity.
But actually, you can do this kind of stuff with PCs.
And you can do them with phone kiosks.
OK, now, that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie, right?
But is, in fact, about the art of delegation.
And from a design perspective, it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people.
I mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing.
If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff.
And this is where they take the stuff that breaks, and they fix it, and they put it back into circulation.
If you want a big idea, you need to embrace everyone on the planet, that's the first thing.
The second thing is the immediacy of objects.
And what I mean by that is, as these become smaller, as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater -- things like banking, identity -- these things quite simply move very quickly around the world.
And someone wrote an article saying, "Don't impose on us the dirty work of happiness."
"We don't care about being happy. We need to live with passion.
We like the ups and downs of life.
We like the ups and downs of life.
We like our suffering because it's so good when it ceases for a while."
This is what I see from the balcony of my hermitage in the Himalayas.
And that led Henri Bergson, the French philosopher, to say, "All the great thinkers of humanity have left happiness in the vague so that each of them could define their own terms."
Well, that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life.
But now, if it is something that is going to determine the quality of every instant of our life, then we better know what it is, have some clearer idea.
Well, that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life.
But now, if it is something that is going to determine the quality of every instant of our life, then we better know what it is, have some clearer idea.
And probably, the fact that we don't know that is why, so often, although we seek happiness, it seems we turn our back to it.
I can hear it two, three, five times.
If I had to hear it 24 hours, non-stop, it might be very tiring.
If you are feeling very cold, you come near a fire, it's so wonderful.
If I had to hear it 24 hours, non-stop, it might be very tiring.
If you are feeling very cold, you come near a fire, it's so wonderful.

It sort of uses itself as you experience it.
Look at anger itself.
It looks very menacing, like a billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm.
We think we could sit on the cloud, but if you go there, it's just mist.
We asked meditators, who have been doing that for years and years, to put their mind in a state where there's nothing but loving kindness, total availability to sentient being.
Of course, during the training, we do that with objects.
We think of people suffering, of people we love, but at some point, it can be a state which is all pervading.
It even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you've seen.
What's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953.
And the reason I'm saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent.
This is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere.
You've seen this in various forms, but maybe you haven't seen this one.
What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating.
So I should say, I guess, that since the time of that original President Johnson report, and the various reports of the U.S. National Academy -- 1977, 1982, 1990 -- people always talked about this idea.
Not as something that was foolproof, but as an idea to think about.
But when climate became, politically, a hot topic -- if I may make the pun -- in the last 15 years, this became so un-PC, we couldn't talk about it.
And we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision.
So here's one last thought, which was said much, much better 25 years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today.
And I think it really summarizes where we are here.
So here's one last thought, which was said much, much better 25 years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today.
And I think it really summarizes where we are here.
That the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about, is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions -- but also, I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control, whether we like it or not.
And 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize agriculture from mountains of stuff that people have overproduced.
This would be a good outcome for energy. And of course, by now, you're probably saying to yourself, "Self, I thought I came to a talk about energy and here's this guy talking about biology."
So where's the link between these two things?
So where's the link between these two things?
One of the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand. We don't even know what oil is. We don't know where oil comes from. I mean, literally, it's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from. The best assumption, and one of the best guesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes
out of this stuff, that these things absorb sunlight, rot under pressure for millions of years, and you get these black rivers.
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly over west Texas, the types of wells that you're beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures of Kansas and those irrigated plots.
This is how you farm oil. And as you think of farming oil and how oil has evolved, we started with this brute force approach. And then what did we learn? Then we learned we had to go bigger. And then what'd we learn? Then we have to go even bigger. And we are getting really destructive as we're going out and farming this bioenergy.
These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest trucks in the world are working here, and then you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to separate it, which only works at today's oil prices.
The assumption is that the basic law really takes the form of a unified theory of all the particles.
Now, some people call that a theory of everything.
That's wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical.
That's wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical.
And I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like, and so on.
You've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway.  There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff.
What would you do?
What experiments would you run?
Wow.  Our research on the biomechanics of animal locomotion has allowed us to make a blueprint for a foot.
If you want to study how a foot works, we're going to have to simulate those surfaces, or simulate that debris.
When we did that, here's a new experiment that we did: we put an animal and had it run -- this grass spider -- on a surface with 99 percent of the contact area removed.
But it didn't even slow down the animal.
When we did that, here's a new experiment that we did: we put an animal and had it run -- this grass spider -- on a surface with 99 percent of the contact area removed.
But it didn't even slow down the animal.
It's still running at the human equivalent of 300 miles per hour.
No problem for the cockroach -- they can grow them back, if you care.
How do they do it?
Look carefully: this is slowed down 100 times, and watch what it's doing with the rest of its leg.
It uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there -- truly extraordinary.
In 1951, Escher made this drawing. He thought he created an animal fantasy.
But we know that art imitates life, and it turns out nature, three million years ago, evolved the next animal.
Not just with the traditional foot, but also the leg, and even of the body.
Can this help us inspire the design of novel robots?
We biologically inspired this robot, named RHex, built by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years.
RHex's foot started off to be quite simple, then it got tuned over time, and ultimately resulted in this half circle.
Why is that? The video will show you.
Watch where the robot, now, contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain.
Why is that? The video will show you.
Watch where the robot, now, contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain.
What you'll see, in fact, is that it's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot.
When you touched the cockroach leg, what did it feel like?
Did you notice something?
Boy: Spiny.
Did you notice something?
Boy: Spiny.
Robert Full: It's spiny, right? It's really spiny, isn't it? It sort of hurts.
Well, here's RHex: RHex has trouble on rails -- on smooth rails, as you see here.
So why not add a spine? My colleagues did this at U. Penn.
Dan Koditschek put some steel nails -- very simple version -- on the robot, and here's RHex, now, going over those steel -- those rails. No problem!
Dan Koditschek put some steel nails -- very simple version -- on the robot, and here's RHex, now, going over those steel -- those rails. No problem!
How does it do it?
Let's slow it down and you can see the spines in action.
One of the ones I'm passing around is climbing up this vertical surface that's a smooth metal plate.
It's extraordinary how fast it can do it -- but if you slow it down, you see something that's quite extraordinary.
It's a secret. The animal effectively climbs by slipping and look -- and doing, actually, terribly, with respect to grabbing on the surface.
You see what happens?
That pad comes out. And that's where the glue is.
Here from underneath is an ant foot, and when the claws don't dig in, that pad automatically comes out without the ant doing anything.
Very strange. How do they stick?
If you look at their feet, they have leaf-like structures called linalae with millions of hairs.
And each hair has the worst case of split ends possible.
We took some hairs from a molting gecko; put three rolls of them on here, and then made this Band-Aid.
This is an undergraduate volunteer -- we have 30,000 undergraduates so we can choose among them -- that's actually just a red pen mark.
But it makes an incredible Band-Aid.

Here's the new project: we're trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot -- no suction or magnets -- that can only move on limited kinds of surfaces.
I call the new robot RiSE, for "Robot in Scansorial Environment" -- that's a climbing environment -- and we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot.
And here is RiSE.
And here is RiSE.
It's six-legged and has a tail. Here it is on a fence and a tree.
And here are RiSE's first steps on an incline.
And here are RiSE's first steps on an incline.
You have the audio? You can hear it go up.
And here it is coming up at you, in its first steps up a wall.
The one, we can call it the cynical design, that means the design invented by Raymond Loewy in the '50s, who said, what is ugly is a bad sale, la laideur se vend mal, which is terrible.
It means the design must be just the weapon for marketing, for producer to make product more sexy, like that, they sell more: it's shit, it's obsolete, it's ridiculous.
I call that the cynical design.
We have a way to look at Earth like that, you know, "I am the man. The final man.
You know, we mutate during four billion years before, but now, because it's me, we stop. Fin.  For the end, for the eternity, it is one with a red jacket."
Something like that. I am not sure of that.  Because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that.
This line of evolution is clearly positive.
From far, this line looks very smooth, like that.
But if you take a lens, like that, this line is ack, ack, ack, ack, ack. Like that.
It's OK. We are in the light.
But sometimes, like today, we fall, we fall so fast, so fast to shadow, we fall so fast to barbaria.
With many, many, many, many face of barbaria.
And with each iteration of that algorithm, you learn the iterations of the myth.
You learn the next level of knowledge.
And finally, all over Africa, you see this board game.

Right? It's just like a cost-benefit analysis.
And I measured out the lengths of straw, put it on a log-log plot, got the scaling exponent, and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height in the wind engineering handbook.
So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology.
So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology.
The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found was actually not in geometry, it was in a symbolic code, and this was Bamana sand divination.
And the same divination system is found all over Africa.
But I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed, buried in sand, and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on.
And finally, he revealed the truth of the matter.
And it turns out it's a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos.
We've started a pilot program in Ghana.
We got a small seed grant, just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this; we're very excited about the future possibilities for that.
We've also been working in design.
Bernard Tschumi at Columbia University has finished using this in a design for a museum of African art.
David Hughes at Ohio State University has written a primer on Afrocentric architecture in which he's used some of these fractal structures.
And finally, I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization, as we heard earlier, it's in the brain.
By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator?
Seriously, if you have a calculator with you, raise your hand.
Raise your hand. Did your hand go up?
In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier.
Let's take the largest number on the board here, 8649.
Would you each enter that on your calculator?
We can do it that way.
Of course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that.
I brought with me a book of calendars.
Right now, as Bill McDonough has pointed out, the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences.
We're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot.
We don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats.
Or we don't know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient; it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill? In other words, we're oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use.
In a sense, the room itself is the elephant in the room, but we don't see it. And we've become victims of a system that points us elsewhere. Consider this.
There's a wonderful book called Stuff: The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects.
And it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt.
And it talks about where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer. And it mentions, for instance, that cotton is very resistant to textile dye; about 60 percent washes off into wastewater.
And it's well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia.
So I thought, "I will talk about death."
Seemed to be the passion today.
Actually, it's not about death.
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them, and the paper that touched his hand is in mine, and I feel connected to him.
So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one.
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book, a soul-searching letter.
Number two: Own a pocketknife.
Pocketknives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing.
Your first pocketknife is like the first universal tool that you're given.

You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah.
It turns out that our brains are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time.
But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too.
So practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability.
Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances.
There is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher.
Next time you're about to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out.
Number five: Two-parter.
Break the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case, digital media.

A car is a similar object, and they can get in a car and drive it.
And that really gives them a handle on a world in a way that they don't often have access to.
And it's perfectly legal.
Soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed.
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive, and a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.

For most Western young women of today, being called a feminist is an insult.
Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting, and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.
Feminism is not dead, by no means.

That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.
The next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic, her first patient is waiting for her with her husband.
The woman's face looks like a watermelon.
I thought he was joking when he first showed it to me.
I thought it was all graphics. So here it is in reverse.
Watch the skin color; watch the skin texture.
But design, for some reason, is still misunderstood for decoration.
It's really interesting: what many people think when I say the word "design" is they think of this kind of overdesigned -- in this case, it's overdesigned on purpose, but -- decoration, interior decoration.
They think of somebody choosing fabrics.
So, Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA and it ended at the beginning of last year.
It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection.
It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency.
It's a sense of economy and a sense, also, of humor.
This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland, who's South African.
It's a suit for civil disobedience.
I'm trying to find not the metaphors, but, rather, the points in common -- the common gripes, the common issues, the common preoccupations -- and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design as an instruction, as a direction rather than a prescription of form.
And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this.
I've sent an email already to quite a few of you.
And it was at his house that I heard for the first time Bartok's Third Piano Concerto and learned from Mr. Teszler that it had been composed in nearby Asheville, North Carolina in the last year of the composer's life.
He was dying of leukemia and he knew it, and he dedicated this concerto to his wife, Dita, who was herself a concert pianist.
And into the slow, second movement, marked "adagio religioso," he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring; he was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part.
And he opened the door and we walked into a windowless 20-by-20-foot room with shelves from floor to ceiling, and crammed on every shelf his collection of Mayan ceramics.
Now, I know absolutely nothing about Mayan ceramics, but I wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so I said, "But Dr. Robicsek, this is absolutely dazzling."
"Yes," he said. "That is what the Louvre said.
But they did, they did like each other.
They got along famously until the very end of the meal, and then they got into a furious argument.
And what they were arguing about was this: whether the second Harry Potter movie was as good as the first.  Mr. Milliken said it was not. Dr. Robicsek disagreed.
Well, I think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life.
And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility -- and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech.
So, from that fountain I built this building.
And you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program to your program."
Because back then, we were building a trades program.
He said, "That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals for the Heinz company."
That's puff pastry day. Why?
Because the students made puff pastry and that's what the school ate every day.
But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food.
And now that I have, I want to give you a gift."
I said, "You're the gift."
He said, "No, sir. You're the gift.
And I want my music to be with you."
And that worked out all right.
When the Basie band came, the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights to the music.
Then the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them and got nominated for a second Grammy back to back.
So, we've become one of the hot, young jazz recording studios in the United States of America  in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate.
That's the place all filled up with Republicans.
This was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building -- and so I had another cardboard box built and I walked back out in the streets again.
And that's the building, and that's the model, and on the right's a high-tech greenhouse and in the middle's the medical technology building.
And I'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done.
And that weekend, I was going back home and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night -- first time I'd met him.
And he walked in and he says, "What is this?"
And I said, "Herbie, this is my concept of a training center for poor people."
And in the back of the room, a woman stood up and she said, "In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place, you're the only person that's come down here and treated us with dignity.
I'm going with you, man."
And she turned that audience around on a pin.
I'm going to start with how I started with this concept seven years ago, when Princess Diana died.
There was a sort of a standstill in Britain the moment of her death, and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way.
I was fascinated by this phenomenon, so I wondered: could one erase the image of Diana, actually quite crudely and physically?
Was she pregnant? Did she want his baby?
Was she pregnant when she died?
So I created this image of Diana, Dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child and this image came out, which caused a huge public outcry at the time.
This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance, but you think it's Camilla and the Queen, and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real.
And the camera can lie, and it makes it very, very easy with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths.
So, I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter.
This was another newspaper image.
It was an April fool actually, and to this day some people think it's real.
I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day, and they were saying there's this great image of the Queen sitting outside William Hill.
So I made sure the work was not compromised in any way and that the integrity of the work remained the same.
But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on, you're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product and that's all you're doing.
When you take the logo off, you're opening up the interpretations and making the work inconclusive, opposed to conclusive when you are advertising.
And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous, in a way; I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery.
It's an extremely fast way of getting information.
It's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly, and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery.
Fifteen years earlier, I was a science journalist who people just laughed at when I said, "I really would like to start my own computer magazine."
And 15 years later, there are 100 of them and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times.
The date was February 2000.

I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law -- ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever.
You can ask about what causes it biochemically: neuroscience, serotonin, all that stuff.
You can ask what are the psychological causes of it: nature? Nurture? Current circumstance?
Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing.
You're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad."
So, I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason, and I will promise you right here and now that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with.
Truth, curiosity, diversity, no selling, no corporate bullshit, no bandwagoning, no platforms.
Maybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand."
So, people really respond very quickly to it, to prices.
And the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology.
Why do we travel too much?
Car travel is underpriced and therefore we over-consumed.
We need to put this better market feedback.
And if we have it, you'll decide how many miles to drive, what mode of travel, where to live and work.
And wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible.
So, I want to move now to the second part of my story, which is: when are we going to start doing this congestion pricing? Road pricing is coming.
Volunteers flew in, added a whole bunch of devices, and for the next 12 months, mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in New Orleans.
Another example is in Portsmouth, U.K.
They mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals.

During many years, I made some speeches starting with this saying: "City is not a problem, it's a solution."


It's a simple idea about nature.
Although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit; it's not a technology.
It's very powerful for, I think, changing our relationship to the natural world and to the other species on whom we depend.
And that tool is very simply, as Chris suggested, looking at us and the world from the plants' or the animals' point of view.
Like a lot of my ideas, like a lot of the tools I use, I found it in the garden; I'm a very devoted gardener.
And there was a day about seven years ago: I was planting potatoes, it was the first week of May -- this is New England, when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom; they're just white clouds above.
I was here, planting my chunks, cutting up potatoes and planting it, and the bees were working on this tree; bumblebees, just making this thing vibrate.
Because, of course, the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge, but we know better.
We know that what's going on between the bee and that flower is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower.
And when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right?
And I'm going to take you to a farm right now, because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system and what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn.
And the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today, to me, is the final triumph of corn over good sense.   It is part of corn's scheme for world domination.
And you will see, the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us.
And what I need to tell you is that on 100 acres he gets 40,000 pounds of beef; 30,000 pounds of pork; 25,000 dozen eggs; 20,000 broilers; 1,000 turkeys; 1,000 rabbits -- an immense amount of food.
You know, you hear, "Can organic feed the world?"
Well, look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...

So when they lose a lot of leaf mass, they shed roots; they kind of cauterize them and the roots die.
And the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots, decomposing them -- the earthworms, the fungi, the bacteria -- and the result is new soil.
This is how soil is created.
But at some point, they banded together to hunt bigger game.
And we don't know exactly how they did this, although they must have solved some collective action problems; it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons while you're fighting with the other groups.
And again, we have no way of knowing, but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged.
Neither one wants to be the first one or they're going to get the sucker's payoff, but both lose, of course, because they don't get what they want.
If they could only agree, if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into a different payoff matrix called an assurance game, they could proceed.
Twenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question: if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors, how does cooperation exist at all?

Twenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question: if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors, how does cooperation exist at all?
He started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered, much to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won -- it won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won, it won the second tournament -- that's known as tit for tat.
Now, the interesting part comes in more recently when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures and discovered, to their surprise, that slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the Amazon or nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia or a dozen different cultures -- each had radically different ideas of what is fair.
Which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness, that somehow the basis of our economic transactions can be influenced by our social institutions, whether we know that or not.
The other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons.
Instead of, "Neither of us can trust each other, so we have to make suboptimal moves," it's, "You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate."
Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years.
We've seen that ThinkCycle has enabled NGOs in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world, including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now: it's a mechanism for rehydrating cholera victims that's so simple to use it, illiterates can be trained to use it.
Or at least, that's what you say when you identify yourself.
You become part of an "us."
In order to be secure, you defend against "them."
I want to talk about a few of these people that I've met.
Tomorrow, I am going to Cairo, and I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo who are V-Day women, who are opening the first safe house for battered women in the Middle East.
That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line, and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt, and were willing to be attacked and criticized.

When she began her mission eight years ago, she was reviled, she was detested, she was completely slandered in her community.
I am proud to tell you that six months ago, she was elected the deputy mayor of Narok.
I think what I'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security, and if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people, but you make yourself far more insecure.
Not running from loss, but entering grief, surrendering to sorrow.
Real security is not knowing something, when you don't know it.
Real security is hungering for connection rather than power.

We're going to do a song by David Mash called "Listen: the Words Are Gone," and maybe I'll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax.
So, I'm trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked; there are so many.
And ... Well, I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin.
And ... Well, I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin.
It was invented around the 1920s, and the inventor, Léon Theremin -- he also was a musician besides an inventor -- he came up with the idea for making the theremin, I think, when he was working on some shortwave radios.
And there'd be that sound in the signal -- it's like  -- and he thought, "Oh, what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument, because there are pitches in it."

And there'd be that sound in the signal -- it's like  -- and he thought, "Oh, what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument, because there are pitches in it."
And so somehow through developing that, he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now.
And out of this idea started spinning off many, many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities, and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits, and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry.
And finally the building -- this is the model.
And when there were complaints about budget, I said, "Well, it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money: reflections."
This voice does not repeat for six months.
And then you descend to light and to the north and to life.
Well, they said, "People won't understand, they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that."
And I went down and Chief Minister Badal said to me, "We Sikhs have suffered a great deal, as you have Jews.
I was very moved by what I saw today.
We are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people; we're about to embark on that.
The site chosen is across from the Lincoln Memorial; you see it there directly on the Mall. It's the last building on the Mall, on access of the Roosevelt Bridge that comes in from Virginia.
That too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on.
But one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site.
But one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site.
If it were to be anywhere in Washington, it would be an office building, a conference center, a place for negotiating peace and so on -- all of which the building is -- but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial, this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall.
And that was a lot of heat to deal with.
That's the 130-foot diameter library.
That is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship.
So put that library at the bottom of that ship -- that's how big the thing was going to be.
All this was done by hand, with slide rules.
The little Orion ship, and what it would take to do what Orion does with chemicals: you have a ship the size of the Empire State Building.
NASA had no interest; they tried to kill the project.

Military weapon versions that carried hydrogen bombs that could destroy half the planet.
There's another version there that sends retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union.
This is the really secret stuff: how to get directed energy explosions.
The Air Force started to build smaller models and actually started doing this.
The guys in La Jolla said, "We've got to get started now."
They built a high-explosive propelled model.
Anyway, I like Oprah -- I like her girlfriendy-ness, I like her weight issues, I like how she's transformed talk television, I like how she's brought reading back to America -- but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was ... I call it the Soon-Yi moment: it is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone.
And that was that she did two entire shows promoting that movie "The Secret."
Do you guys know about that movie "The Secret"?
Do you guys know about that movie "The Secret"?
It makes "What the Bleep Do We Know" seem like a doctoral dissertation from Harvard on quantum mechanics -- that's how bad it is.
It makes "The DaVinci Code" seem like "War and Peace."
We went too far.  BF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual.
The design of the body is a whole different thing.
DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top.
you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way, pull up other information -- there are lots of Web and information sources about places you might want to go -- you can zoom in, you can pull back out.
The whole resources are there available for you.
So, Microsoft -- this is a project that -- WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray, who's our colleague, and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible.
It's a labor of love for us and our small team, and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe.
So basically, kids of all ages, like us.
And so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring.
And if you measure very, very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge, you'll see that those two shapes are exactly the same size.
And the Talmud saw this a long time ago, saying, "We see things not as they are, but as we are."
I certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then, if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion.
So they had created these artifacts.
Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious, which I thought for a long time, until she explained to me was to slow them down so they'll think.
So they're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up.
And I can try steering the car here by ...
See the car turn by five here?
So what if I click this down to zero?
See the car turn by five here?
So what if I click this down to zero?
It goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine-year-olds.
If I turn this wheel, you can see that number over there going minus and positive.
That's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out there and to just drop it into the script here, and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel.
And it's interesting.
Student 4l: [I decided to] do the shot put and the sponge ball because they're two totally different weights, and if you drop them at the same time, maybe they'll drop at the same speed.
Teacher: Drop. Class: Whoa!
AK: So obviously, Aristotle never asked a child about this particular point because, of course, he didn't bother doing the experiment, and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas.
If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another.
And I have brought for you a real human brain.
So this is a real human brain.
Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant: It has been.  Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment.
It's all about "right here, right now."
Our right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies.
I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you.
And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke.
On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye.
It took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards.
In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere.
I do not understand numbers, I do not understand the telephone, but it's the only plan I have.
In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere.
I do not understand numbers, I do not understand the telephone, but it's the only plan I have.
So I take the phone pad and I put it right here.
The thing on the right is a snake form, a ziggurat.
And I put them together, and you walk between them.
It was a dialog with the context again.
It was a dialog with the context again.
Now, if you saw a picture of this as it was published in Architectural Record -- they didn't show the context, so you would think, "God, what a pushy guy this is."
But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant.
And when I got there, everything was perfect -- except the tail.
So, I decided to cut off the head and the tail.
And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker.
Toxic waste, I guess, is the key clue to that one.
And so we built a temporary building -- I'm getting good at temporary -- and we put a conference room in that's a fish.
And, finally, Jay dragged me to my hometown, Toronto, Canada.

And there is a story -- it's a real story -- about my grandmother buying a carp on Thursday, bringing it home, putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid.

I played with it in the evening.
And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link, which nobody will forgive me for.
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School.
And that chain link is really expensive.
Oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of the real proposal.
It made my building look sick.
And it was this interaction between that kind of, up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting.
The whole thing about my house, the whole use of rough carpentry and everything, was the frustration with the crafts available.
I said, "If I can't get the craft that I want, I'll use the craft I can get."
There were plenty of models for that, in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and many artists who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials.
He'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower.
I told him, "No, no, that's too ongepotchket.
I don't want the tower."
We redid the side of the building and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space.
And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved, because they have very strict kind of design guideline, and they wouldn't normally think I would fit them.
The detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building.

In Barcelona, on Las Ramblas for some film festival, I did the Hollywood sign going and coming, made a building out of it, and they built it.
I flew in one night and took this picture.
And it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house.
When you have to do something really cheaply, it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff.
That big metal thing is a passage, and in it is -- you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom, which is on the right.
These people are art collectors.
And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side.
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it.
And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side.

It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply -- it's that formed lumber from Finland.

We used it at Loyola on the chapel, and it didn't work.
And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum, and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry.
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries.
And this would be a hotel.
And a long time ago, about '82 or something, after my house -- I designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard -- and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left.
And she came back, I guess wealthier or something -- something happened -- and asked me to design a house for her on this site.
And following that basic idea of the village, we changed it as we got into it.
And the bed is back in this space, with windows looking out onto the lake.
These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot.
The material is lead copper, like in the building in Boston.
If any of you guys have any ideas for it, please contact me.
I don't know what to do.
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment, and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons.
Most halls come straight down into a proscenium.
In this case we're opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners.
And so it will be quite a different shape.
It's a kiva, and Larry's putting some water in there, and it works much better than a fish.
In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish, and we're working on that, at the foot of a Ritz-Carlton Tower being done by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.
And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel, non-fire proof, much like those old gas tanks.
Time goes on.
And this is my son working with me on a small fast-food thing.
He designed the robot as the cashier, and the head moves, and I did the rest of it.
He designed the robot as the cashier, and the head moves, and I did the rest of it.
And the food wasn't as good as the stuff, and so it failed.
It should have been the other way around -- the food should have been good first.
Well, I'm not going to explain this equation, but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject.
We can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line.
And, admittedly, it's in a very shorthand notation.
And when I try to explain my work to her, she waved away all the details, and she said, "Neil, there's only one question that really matters.
What banged?"  "Everyone talks about the Big Bang. What banged?"
And she's right. It's a question we've all been avoiding.
We've shown that it can fit all of the data that we have about the formation of galaxies, the fluctuations in the microwave background.
Furthermore, there's an experimental way to tell this theory, apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before.
It involves gravitational waves.
They said, "Go and do it, and we'll come and lecture."
And I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students from these countries -- where they don't have any opportunities -- together with the best lecturers in the world -- who I knew would come, because of the interest in Africa -- and put them together and just let the sparks fly.
So we bought a derelict hotel near Cape Town.
So we bought a derelict hotel near Cape Town.
It's an 80-room Art Deco hotel from the 1920s.
The area was kind of seedy, so we got an 80-room hotel for 100,000 dollars.

Tendai Mugwagwa: My name is Tendai Mugwagwa.
I have a Bachelor of Science with an education degree.
I will be attending AIMS.
Among them will be not only brilliant scientists -- I'm sure of that from what we've seen at AIMS -- they'll also be the African Gates, Brins and Pages of the future.
Well, I said we also have a plan. And our plan is quite simple.
AIMS is now a proven model.
You'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers.
And so we started talking about this.
And at the same time, I thought about this massive group of people I knew: writers, editors, journalists, graduate students, assistant professors, you name it.
So we thought, "We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody -- sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway, why don't we just open up the front of the building for students to come in there after school, get extra help on their written homework, so you have basically no border between these two communities?"
So the idea was that we would be working on whatever we're working on, at 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing, or you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.
You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood.
You can't just have a tutoring center."
So we thought, "Ha ha! Really!"
And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell, but we did all the necessary research.
So we thought, "Ha ha! Really!"
And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell, but we did all the necessary research.
It used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below, acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.
And we looked around and somebody else said, "Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer."  And so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh, and we said, "There's a point to that.
Let's sell pirate supplies." This is the pirate supply store.
You see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin.
These are all sort of repurposed other products, or whatever.
All the packaging is done by Sam Potts.
So then you have the villain containment unit, where kids put their parents. You have the office.
There are a million ways.
You can walk up to your local school and consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help.
So, this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco, they did this phenomenal job.
The word "belief" itself originally meant to love, to prize, to hold dear.
In the 17th century, it narrowed its focus, for reasons that I'm exploring in a book I'm writing at the moment, to include -- to mean an intellectual assent to a set of propositions, a credo.
"I believe:" it did not mean, "I accept certain creedal articles of faith."
Tell us where we're going wrong. Let's talk together about where religion is failing."
Because it seems to me that with -- our current situation is so serious at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time.
And religion, with its wide following ... Here in the United States, people may be being religious in a different way, as a report has just shown -- but they still want to be religious. It's only Western Europe that has retained its secularism, which is now beginning to look rather endearingly old-fashioned.
And Achilles looks at him and thinks of his father. And he starts to weep.
And Priam looks at the man who has murdered so many of his sons, and he, too, starts to weep. And the sound of their weeping filled the house.
The Greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people.
I was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations, which was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism, and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism.
And the Alliance has told me that they are very happy to work with it.
The importance of this is that this is -- I can see some of you starting to look worried, because you think it's a slow and cumbersome body -- but what the United Nations can do is give us some neutrality, so that this isn't seen as a Western or a Christian initiative, but that it's coming, as it were, from the United Nations, from the world -- who would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this.

And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted.
It's a statue made by Verrocchio, of David, for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15.
And if we now compare the face of the statue, with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.
And if we now compare the face of the statue, with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.
The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces.
Ladies and gentlemen, this story has not yet been published.
People have wanted to look inside the human mind, the human brain, for thousands of years.
Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.
People envision this as being very difficult.
And that constant is the speed of sound.
So, in order to measure the speed of sound, all I've got to do is know its frequency. Well, that's easy.
I've got a frequency counter right here.
The slinky moves. We're going through different nodes of the wave, coming out this way.
Those of you who are physicists, I hear you rolling your eyes, but bear with me.  To measure the wavelength, all I need to do is measure the distance from here -- one full wave -- over to here.
From here to here is the wavelength of sound.

I’m working a lot with motion and animation, and also I'm an old DJ and a musician.
So, music videos are something that I always found interesting, but they always seem to be so reactive.

So, music videos are something that I always found interesting, but they always seem to be so reactive.
So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation following it?

We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing.
The first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago.
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years.
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years.
So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible, which is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime of a planet of Earth type.
This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high.

That is why I am in favor of manned -- or should I say, personned -- space flight.
All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions.
I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap.
But the difference is, on Earth, most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere, deposited in the ground as coal, oil, natural gas, etc. On Venus, most of it is in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature is 59 degrees on average. On Venus, it's 855. This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible,
and putting it into the atmosphere.
It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
'70s. '80s. '90s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can.
We have the technologies.
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this: the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions, all has a single, very simple solution.
We can't wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture.
Here's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.
are up to 780 -- and I thought I saw one go by there, just to localize this -- which is good news.
Something that motivates me, and gets me really excited about my research, is when I see simple opportunities to drastically change that distribution and make the technology accessible to a much wider percentage of the population.
I'm going to show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention that I think embody this philosophy.
And they actually use the Nintendo Wii Remote.





The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal. It means a lot to us.
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.
So, that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect -- the idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years -- that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero], that it'll raise our IQ points 10, 20, 30 percent.
Great idea, but it doesn't work at all.

Great idea, but it doesn't work at all.
So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.
And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it, but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way, and that's one of the main parts of my work.
So, with the MIT Media Lab, for quite a while now, we've been engaged in a field called active music.
What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience, not just listening, but making music?
And when we make the Brain Opera, we invite the public to come in, to try these instruments and then collaborate with us to help make each performance of the Brain Opera.
We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna, where we built a museum around it.
And that led to something which you probably do know.

And that led to something which you probably do know.
Guitar Hero came out of our lab, and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface, people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music, and playing it over and over and over again.

So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg, because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero.
And music is very fun, but it's also transformative.
It's very, very important.
Music can change your life, more than almost anything.
It's very, very important.
Music can change your life, more than almost anything.
It can change the way you communicate with others, it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero.
We've had good enough, really, very powerful effects with kids around the world, and now people of all ages, using Hyperscore.
So, we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities in a much broader context, for all kinds of people who don't usually have the opportunity to make music.
So, one of the growing fields that we're working on at the Media Lab right now is music, mind and health.

A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called "Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book.

So we know, for instance, that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to.
Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones, you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror, or can't tell anyone in their family, but you can still find a shard of music that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities.
Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes, movement to people with Parkinson's disease.
I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on.
Video: They're manipulating each other's rhythms.
It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms, but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.

It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms, but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.
The third idea I want to share with you is that music, paradoxically, I think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have of showing who we really are. I love giving talks, although strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music.
If I were here playing cello, or playing on a synth, or sharing my music with you, I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words, more personal things, perhaps deeper things.
I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have, from ourselves to the outside world.

The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera, one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now.
So this guy wants to live forever, he downloads himself into his environment.
The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy.
And the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others, to the people we love, and what we can't.
So, you want to say a little bit about how you guys work?
Adam Boulanger: Yes. So, Tod and I entered into a discussion following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive person, and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face, it's in his breathing, it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform one of his pieces of music? That's our responsibility, and it doesn't make sense.
So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance, with precision, with control, and despite his physical disability, to be able to do that, to be able to perform his piece of music.
We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring.
But instead of making it very literal, showing you exactly the camera tracing, we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement, and shows the way it's being analyzed.
I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement, that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise, very disciplined and they're also very beautiful.
And that's what I want to talk about today, and how that relates to the emergence of social production.
Starting with newspapers, what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information, knowledge and culture, which led to a stark bifurcation between producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital, just like any other industrial organization -- and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce.
Now, the term "information society," "information economy," for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial revolution. But in fact, for purposes of understanding what's happening today, that's wrong. Because for 150 years, we've had an information economy.
What we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we're developing algorithms to let people own machines, like Wi-Fi devices, and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle: When I'm listening, when I'm not using, I can help you transfer your messages; and when you're not using, you'll help me transfer yours.
And this is not an idealized version. These are working models that at least in some places in the United States are being implemented, at least for public security.
If in 1999 I told you, let's build a data storage and retrieval system.
And this is not an idealized version. These are working models that at least in some places in the United States are being implemented, at least for public security.
If in 1999 I told you, let's build a data storage and retrieval system.
It's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world.
But it's not the only one.
Instead, what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use property and contract in the market: information flows to decide what are interesting problems; who's available and good for something; motivation structures -- remember, money isn't always the best motivator.
If you leave a $50 check after dinner with friends, you don't increase the probability of being invited back.
And in particular, what we've seen is task organization.
You have to hire people who know what they're doing.
You have to hire them to spend a lot of time.
Now, take the same problem, chunk it into little modules, and motivations become trivial.
Five minutes, instead of watching TV?
Five minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun.
Five minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun.
Just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning, or, in places that are more involved, like Wikipedia, gives me a certain set of social relations.
So, a new social phenomenon is emerging.

How does the news shape the way we see the world?
All these problems we're talking about -- if we bring development, they will all disappear.
Technology is a great equalizer. How do we make it work?
It's been proved: self-care is cost-effective.
And we will do other centers.
This model can be adapted to every disease process.
All the units, all the centers, are linked through a switched hub to a central server, and all the images are populated to review stations.
People say, "How can you do that?" This is how we can do that.
At least 4,000 rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment have self-confessed that they did not go to Miami because of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean.
And, if they went to Miami, they will spend significantly more -- eight to 10 times more. And they feel happy spending it at home, getting the same quality of care.
And so I'm going to use, as the metaphor, this association: quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand, but I'm still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor.
So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.
And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.
There is also a big question of ambiguity.
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.
And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using, a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years. And it was to send some men -- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.
Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners, would say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while, and seeing the amazing things that happened, you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world, determining how things happen.
So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story, the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me -- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real, and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.

And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.
And they have to be in all possibilities, including those I never considered before.
So, there are never complete answers.
In the year 1919, a virtually unknown German mathematician, named Theodor Kaluza suggested a very bold and, in some ways, a very bizarre idea.
He proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of.
That is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down, Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see.
He proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of.
That is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down, Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see.
Now, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea, sometimes that's all it is -- bold and bizarre, but it has nothing to do with the world around us.
The Earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved because of the Sun's presence.
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works.
Now, this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations.
Now, but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded, two questions immediately arise from his observation.
Number one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they?
We don't seem to see them.
He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties -- there might be big, easy-to-see dimensions, but there might also be tiny, curled-up dimensions, curled up so small, even though they're all around us, that we don't see them.
Let me show you that one visually.
So, imagine you're looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light.
But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around, you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about -- that's like the grid part -- but you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension that's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye or even with any of our most refined equipment.
But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself, the idea is there could be more dimensions, as we see there.
Now that's an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see.

But what about the second question that I asked: does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world?
But what about the second question that I asked: does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world?
Well, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work.
In detail, for instance, they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory.
In detail, for instance, they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory.
So many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s, this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away.
Until something wonderful happened in our age.
So many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s, this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away.
Until something wonderful happened in our age.
In our era, a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself, many others around the world, it's called superstring theory, as you were indicating.
They don't produce different musical notes.
Rather, they produce the different particles making up the world around us.
So if these ideas are correct, this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like.
So matter and the forces of nature all are put together under the rubric of vibrating strings.
And that's what we mean by a unified theory.
Now here is the catch.
And that's what we mean by a unified theory.
Now here is the catch.
When you study the mathematics of string theory, you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space.
Now here is the catch.
When you study the mathematics of string theory, you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space.
It doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six.
And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around -- they'll be there in a second -- right there, notice that they way they vibrate is affected by the geometry of the extra dimensions.
So, if we knew exactly what the extra dimensions look like -- we don't yet, but if we did -- we should be able to calculate the allowed notes, the allowed vibrational patterns.
And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns, we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers.
Here's how it goes. In CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider.
It's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel, opposite directions, near the speed of light.
Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other, so there's a head-on collision.
And, again, a EU standard-size, real person, so you get some sense of the scale.
And it's in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created, sometime in the summer this year.
And actually, this morning, I got an email saying that we've just finished, today, building the last piece of ATLAS.
You know? If you want to know what I'm made of, let's look at me."
Well, we found that as you look back in time, the universe gets hotter and hotter, denser and denser, and simpler and simpler.
Now, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that, but that seems to be the case.
Now, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that, but that seems to be the case.
So, way back in the early times of the universe, we believe it was very simple and understandable.
All this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things -- human brains -- are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe.
All this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things -- human brains -- are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe.
Back at the start, in the first billionth of a second, we believe, or we've observed, it was very simple.
It's almost like ...

It's almost like ...
imagine a snowflake in your hand, and you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated, beautiful object. But as you heat it up, it'll melt into a pool of water, and you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made of H20, water.
So it's in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of.
Well, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.
And back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money for the LHC from the U.K. government, Margaret Thatcher, at the time, said, "If you guys can explain, in language a politician can understand, what the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money.
I want to know what this Higgs particle does."

I want to know what this Higgs particle does."
And we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.
And the picture is that the whole universe -- and that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you -- the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.
Higgs particles, if you will.
The analogy is that these people in a room are the Higgs particles.
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy, in a sense, and massive, because they're surrounded by Higgs particles.
They're interacting with the Higgs field.
If that picture's true, then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.
It's almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.
But they just miss.
Now there's a theory called super-symmetry, which doubles the number of particles in the standard model, which, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.
And if I was to put money on it, I would put money on -- in a very unscientific way -- that that these things would also crop up at the LHC.
Many other things that the LHC could discover.
But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.
And I'd say that it deserves, in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk, to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.
This is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful.
The story goes like this: we know that the universe began 13.7 billion years ago, in an immensely hot, dense state, much smaller than a single atom.
In about the first billionth of a second or so, the Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass.
The universe continued to expand and cool.
After about a few minutes, there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all.
The universe continued to expand and cool.
After about a few minutes, there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all.
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen, 25 percent helium. It still is today.
In the spirit of TED, we're bringing you something that has not been released.
John, do you want to introduce the song?
This is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth which imitates another creature which imitates yet another creature.

It's completely fucked up and can only be explained in song.

So we don't know that much about the history of violinists but we do know that when we entered the state of New Jersey there is an uptick in violence.
This song is called "Asbury Park."
First of all, when you go to bed at night, you've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt the day was a day which you contributed something, and that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could.
And the second thing they said: and we trust you, that no matter where you are or where you go, you will always do the right thing.
Now, I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids, but if you do, please trust me, it's the most pressure you can put on a child, to say --  -- we trust you that you will always do the right thing.
Therefore, when we see that, we see an opportunity to have a business that addresses the need of that segment.
And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning we said it very clearly: this is not a charity.
This is really a business venture, one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market.
It is an initiative that is focused on simple, accessible and human-centric solutions.
What we mean by that is, you know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking more or less, and for 20-odd years, it hasn't changed.
It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same.
We're talking about something very similar here.
And it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach.
What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world, the government plays a key role in the development of technology.
What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world, the government plays a key role in the development of technology.
In other parts, it doesn't.
In other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place.
This is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies -- Google is involved, Red Hat -- and AMD is a key player.
The electronics behind the One Laptop per Child are based on AMD technology; it's a microprocessor.
But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be, one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life.
Because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours, and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it.
The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part, and battery life on this product is now 15 hours -- just through a lot of innovative work people have done because they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this.
We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year, and we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education.
In a single cubic inch of soil, there can be more than eight miles of these cells.
My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium.
This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey.
And notice that as the mycelium grows, it conquers territory and then it begins the net.
I've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years, I have thousands of electron micrographs, and when I'm staring at the mycelium, I realize that they are microfiltration membranes.
We exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium.
When you look at the mycelium, they're highly branched.
And if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly, because of the nodes of crossing -- Internet engineers maybe call them hot points -- there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.
The mycelium is sentient.
And if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly, because of the nodes of crossing -- Internet engineers maybe call them hot points -- there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.
The mycelium is sentient.
It knows that you are there.
I couldn't miss it. It was 2,200 acres in size: 2,200 acres in size, 2,000 years old.
The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick.
How is it that this organism can be so large, and yet be one cell wall thick, whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us?
The mycelium is producing enzymes -- peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds.
These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.
So, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil, and then, when we returned six weeks later, all the tarps were removed, all the other piles were dead, dark and stinky.
And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house.
But the insects aren't stupid, and they would avoid the spores when they came close, and so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form.
And I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish, I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields, every day, in my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium, because there's no spores.
Then we tried extracts, and lo and behold, we can steer insects to different directions.
This has huge implications.
I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one.
This has huge implications.
I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one.
It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.
And then you put tree seeds in here, and then you end up growing -- potentially -- an old-growth forest from a cardboard box.
I want to reinvent the delivery system, and the use of cardboard around the world, so they become ecological footprints.
And that was the mythology of skill.
So, one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill.
And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music -- I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover with the MIT Media Lab -- it relates a lot to music.
OK? And whoever laughed there -- you understood it completely, right?
No, it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there, who's got his hands around that mess, OK.
Well, that's what juggling is about, right?
No, it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there, who's got his hands around that mess, OK.
Well, that's what juggling is about, right?
It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.
Excuse me, still getting there. A moment that travels.
A moment -- no, we'll try that again. It separates, and comes back together.
Time. How can you look at time?
It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle.
Thanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is, you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at 120 miles an hour?
The only other thing is, it was a real shock.
It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape, and the stories that were involved in it, as well as the fact that they protected the contents.
The second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness.
So, if you want to go with the music for cylinders.
And when all this became clear to me, I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine.
So that's what we did.
This is a vending machine for crows.
Crows, on the other hand, show up, and they try and figure it out.
They know that this machine's been messing with them, through three different stages of behavior.
They figure it's gotta have more to it.
And those moms bought and prepared food.
It was like your romantic vision of Europe.
Margarine didn't exist.
And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle, as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer.
Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh, so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.
Thus arrived convenience.
For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.
My mom is not here, so I can say this now.
This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.
Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.
But mostly they didn't eat broccoli.
Instead they were sold on yogurt, yogurt being almost as good as broccoli.
This is a characterization of what it would look like if you could remove the water.
It gives you the false impression it's a map.
It is not a map.
But if you were to put it on an equal area projection, you'd see that the mid-ocean ridge covers 23 percent of the Earth's total surface area.
Almost a quarter of our planet is a single mountain range and we didn't enter it until after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin went to the moon.
So we went to the moon, played golf up there, before we went to the largest feature on our own planet.
So we went to the moon, played golf up there, before we went to the largest feature on our own planet.
And our interest in this mountain range, as Earth scientists in those days, was not only because of its tremendous size, dominating the planet, but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin.
Because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating.
So the Easter Bunny has put things in the ocean floor, and you have massive heavy metal deposits that we're making in this mountain range.
We're making huge discoveries of large commercial-grade ore along this mountain range, but it was dwarfed by what we discovered.
We discovered a profusion of life, in a world that it should not exist [in]. Giant tube worms, 10 feet tall.
Their bodies had been totally taken over by another organism, a bacterium, that had figured out how to replicate photosynthesis in the dark, through a process we now call chemosynthesis.
None of it in our textbooks. None of this in our textbooks.
We did not know about this life system.
Moving on, there's more than just natural history beneath the sea -- human history. Our discoveries of the Titanic.
The realization that the deep sea is the largest museum on Earth.
It contains more history than all of the museums on land combined.
And I was looking at it yesterday, it's up in Seattle. OK.
It comes online this summer, and it begins its journey of exploration.
But we have no idea what we're going find when we go out there with our technology.
Because we want to create -- we want to create the classroom of tomorrow.
We have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it's all being done.
You win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade.
This is a young lady, not watching a football game, not watching a basketball game.
Watching exploration live from thousands of miles away, and it's just dawning on her what she's seeing.
And when you get a jaw drop, you can inform.
So, I had to start on my own. So I moved to San Francisco, and I started a little company, fuseproject.
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.
And I wanted to really not just work on the skins, but I wanted to work on the entire human experience.
And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.
And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light, all the way to a bright work light.
So, the light bulb actually does that.
So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners, it's a partnership. We can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project, and then we also share in the rewards.
And here's another project, another partnership-type approach.
This is called Y Water, and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt, Austrian originally, who came to us, and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink, or an organic drink for his kids, to replace the high-sugar-content sodas that he's trying to get them away from.
But the third pillar that he talked about was design.
And at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.
I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.
I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.
But what he said was really significant, is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product, how we were going to make it low cost, robust.
And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key --  -- and the Num Lock key, too.
And then the integration of all these great technologies, which you've heard about, the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect; the screen, which you can read in sunlight; the keyboard, which is made out of rubber, and it's protected from the environment.
You know, all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the OLPC people and the engineers.
They fought the suppliers, they fought the manufacturers.
In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.
It's because we were able to run, during the manufacturing process, 20 colors for the X and the O, which is the name of the computer, and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor, you get 20 times 20: you get 400 different options there.
So, the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible.
Like paper, paper and cardboard.
So, I'm going to finish with one last project, and this is a little bit more of adult play.
Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.
And also, working with wire -- everything that I did was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision at the same time.
So, I was able to sort of exercise all of that.
Now, this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting.

Now, this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting.
The next piece that is going to come up is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex.
I gave myself the problem.
Since I'm always liking to solve problems, I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction, and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth.
I imagine what can be said with them.
This next one here, "Machine with Wishbone," it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner.
You know, they say, never play with your food -- but I always play with things.
That's about that big.
This kind of work is also very much like puppetry, where the found object is, in a sense, the puppet, and I'm the puppeteer at first, because I'm playing with an object.
But then I make the machine, which is sort of the stand-in for me, and it is able to achieve the action that I want.

The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought, and it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair."
And it's really, just sort of -- for me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil.
And then, I got a call from a friend who wanted to have a show of erotic art, and I didn't have any pieces.
But when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind.
When I moved to Boston, I joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society.
And the idea, their premise was that we wanted to show pieces of sculpture on the street, and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best.
It would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.
It's always a struggle, but somehow I manage to sort of get this thought out into an object, and then it's there, OK.
It means nothing at all.
The object itself just means nothing.

Now that is less than a year old, in an operating room.
That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria.
You remember all that oil?
This is what makes it so amazing.
You don't need a designer, or a plan, or foresight, or anything else.
If there's something that is copied with variation and it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere.
He wanted a name for the new replicator.
So, he took the Greek word "mimeme," which means that which is imitated.
Remember that, that's the core definition: that which is imitated.
He wanted a name for the new replicator.
So, he took the Greek word "mimeme," which means that which is imitated.
Remember that, that's the core definition: that which is imitated.
The whole science of memetics is much maligned, much misunderstood, much feared.
But a lot of these problems can be avoided by remembering the definition.
A meme is not equivalent to an idea.
Stick with the definition.
It's that which is imitated, or information which is copied from person to person.
So, let's see some memes.
The genes are forced into producing all this myelin, all the fat to myelinate the brain.
Do you know, sitting here, your brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output for two percent of your body weight?
It's a really expensive organ to run.
Do you know, sitting here, your brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output for two percent of your body weight?
It's a really expensive organ to run.
Why? Because it's producing the memes.

Why? Because it's producing the memes.
Now, it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off, and maybe it nearly did, but you see, we don't know.
The question is, how is it going to help their development?
It's a huge opportunity for transformational development.
Will it be taken?
And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction.
You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment, how they've been sold over the last 40 years?
A company flies in, does a deal with a minister.
And that's great for the company, and it's quite often great for the minister --  -- and it's not great for their country.
There's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that, and it's called verified auctions.
The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury -- that is, the British Treasury.
The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury -- that is, the British Treasury.
And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third-generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth.
They worked out they were worth two billion pounds.
She says, "Oh, that's beautiful.
What is it? Is that Jackson Pollock?"
And unfortunately, I can be a little too honest.
I said, "No, it's -- it's penguin shit."
And, you know, "Excuse me!"
And I could sense that she thought I was speaking synecdochically.
Changing into a totally different field, we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics, particularly in an area called metamaterials.
A metamaterial is an artificial material, which manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation, in a way that you couldn't otherwise.
So, this device here is an invisibility cloak.
The study of dinosaurs may, literally, one day save the planet.
Study of the ancient climate is very important.
In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived, had much higher CO2 than today, was much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points for the effects of CO2 on climate.
Some got killed, and some did it without drug assistance.
So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson, that wasn't fiction.
The only question is, what was in the juice?
And more importantly, that line between good and evil -- which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable, with them on the good side, the others on the bad side -- I knew that line was movable, and it was permeable.
Good people could be seduced across that line, and under good and some rare circumstances, bad kids could recover with help, with reform, with rehabilitation.
So I want to begin with this wonderful illusion by [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher.
But let's look more deeply, and as we do, what appears is the demons, the devils in the world.
That tells us several things.
One, the world is, was, will always be filled with good and evil, because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition.
He didn't do a good job of keeping it there though.
So, this arc of the cosmic transformation of God's favorite angel into the Devil, for me, sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good, ordinary people into perpetrators of evil.
So the Lucifer effect, although it focuses on the negatives -- the negatives that people can become, not the negatives that people are -- leads me to a psychological definition. Evil is the exercise of power.
What does the situation bring out of them?
And what is the system that creates and maintains that situation?
My recent book, "The Lucifer Effect," is about, how do you understand how good people turn evil?
He said, "You know, clearly at some point, we were all of an animal nature, and at some point, we weren't."
And he viewed proto-shamanism as a kind of original attempt, through ritual, to rekindle a connection that had been irrevocably lost.
So, he saw this art not as hunting magic, but as postcards of nostalgia.
Taken from their families, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness for 18 years -- two nine-year periods deliberately chosen to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb.
All that time, the world only exists as an abstraction, as they are taught the values of their society.
Values that maintain the proposition that their prayers, and their prayers alone, maintain the cosmic balance.
You can see the calcium buildup on the head of the poporo gourd.
The gourd is a feminine aspect; the stick is a male.
You put the stick in the powder to take the sacred ashes -- well, they're not ashes, they're burnt limestone -- to empower the coca leaf, to change the pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption of cocaine hydrochloride.
And what struck me so extraordinary was to be again with the Inuit -- a people who don't fear the cold, but take advantage of it.
A people who find a way, with their imagination, to carve life out of that very frozen.
A people for whom blood on ice is not a sign of death, but an affirmation of life.
These are not dying peoples.
On the contrary, you know, if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see, you discover that the world is not flat.
The world remains a rich tapestry.
The shield laws are our laws -- pretty much a patchwork of state laws -- that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source.
This is happening, however, against the background of the rise of Web logging.
Web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization.
If you look at the origins of this, the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here.
But actually, the machine I'm going to tell you about, the Institute for Advanced Study machine, which is way up there, really should be down there. So, I'm trying to revise history, and give some of these guys more credit than they've had.
Such a computer would open up universes, which are, at the present, outside the range of any instruments.
So it's almost exactly -- it's 50 years ago next Tuesday, I guess.
And he saw everything in terms of -- he could read the binary code straight off the machine.
He had a wonderful rapport.
Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him.
Even errors were duplicated.
"Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong, code is right."
They have to go out and do something. And he started doing that, started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with -- playing chess with other machines and so on.
And they did start to evolve.
And he went around the country after that.
It took really three people: Barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing; Von Neumann saw how you could build the machines -- that now, last count, four million of these Von Neumann machines is built every 24 hours; and Julian Bigelow, who died 10 days ago -- this is John Markoff's obituary for him -- he was the important missing link, the engineer who came in and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work.
And all our computers have, inside them, the copies of the architecture that he had to just design one day, sort of on pencil and paper.
And we owe a tremendous credit to that.
And we owe a tremendous credit to that.
And he explained, in a very generous way, the spirit that brought all these different people to the Institute for Advanced Study in the '40s to do this project, and make it freely available with no patents, no restrictions, no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world.
That's the last entry in the logbook when the machine was shut down, July 1958.
I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans who die from cigarette smoking.
More than 400,000 people die in the United States every year from smoking cigarettes.
And so, this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes.
And the day after that, another 1,100 Americans died from smoking.
And every single day since then, 1,100 Americans have died.
And today, 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking.
Contrary to calculations made by some engineers, bees can fly, dolphins can swim, and geckos can even climb up the smoothest surfaces. Now, what I want to do, in the short time I have, is to try to allow each of you to experience the thrill of revealing nature's design.
I get to do this all the time, and it's just incredible.
I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation.
So, the answer is bio-mimicry: just copy nature directly.
We know from working on animals that the truth is that's exactly what you don't want to do -- because evolution works on the just-good-enough principle, not on a perfecting principle.
And the constraints in building any organism, when you look at it, are really severe. Natural technologies have incredible constraints.
And this is really important when you begin to look at animals.
Instead, we believe you need to be inspired by biology.
You need to discover the general principles of nature, and then use these analogies when they're advantageous.
And we were able to create a model where animals are not only bouncing up and down, but they're also bouncing side to side at the same time.
And many organisms fit this kind of pattern.
Now, why is this important to have this model?

And many organisms fit this kind of pattern.
Now, why is this important to have this model?
Because it's very interesting. When you take this model and you perturb it, you give it a push, as it bumps into something, it self-stabilizes, with no brain or no reflexes, just by the structure alone.
It's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape that they like, and put in the material properties.
They can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself.
For example, here's a leg: the clear part is stiff, the white part is compliant, and you don't need any axles there or anything.
So, we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height of the animals that we're looking at.
And we were certain they couldn't do this. And here's what they did.
The animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down!
And we were certain they couldn't do this. And here's what they did.
The animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down!
It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all.
And we were certain they couldn't do this. And here's what they did.
The animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down!
It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all.
We couldn't believe that it could do this. It said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple, springy legs, you could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built.
Here's the first example of that. This is the Stanford Shape Deposition Manufactured robot, named Sprawl.
It has six legs -- there are the tuned, springy legs.
It has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front, and the hind leg on the other side. Sort of an alternating tripod, and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal.
Robert Full: It'll go on different surfaces -- here's sand -- although we haven't perfected the feet yet, but I'll talk about that later.
Here's RHex entering the woods.
Robert Full: It'll go on different surfaces -- here's sand -- although we haven't perfected the feet yet, but I'll talk about that later.
Here's RHex entering the woods.
Again, this robot can't see anything, it can't feel anything, it has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system, with very simple parts, but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal.
They can run up a wall at a meter a second, 15 steps per second, and they look like they're running on the level. How do they do this?
It's just phenomenal. The one on the right was going up the hill.
How do they do this? They have bizarre toes. They have toes that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out, and then peel off the surface, like tape.
They do this with their toes. It's bizarre! This peeling inspired iRobot -- that we work with -- to build Mecho-Geckos.
Here's a legged version and a tractor version, or a bulldozer version.
Let's see some of the geckos move with some video, and then I'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots.
You have to take 1,000 pictures per second to see this.
And here's some video at 1,000 frames per second.
Now, I want you to look at the animal's back.
Now, I want you to look at the animal's back.
Do you see how much it's bending like that? We can't figure that out -- that's an unsolved mystery. We don't know how it works.
If you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to Berkeley, come to my lab and we'll figure this out. Okay, send them to Berkeley because that's the next thing I want to do. Here's the gecko mill.
Here's the animal that we have here, running on a vertical surface.
Pick a foot and try to watch a toe, and see if you can see what the animal's doing.
See it uncurl and then peel these toes.
They don't have any glue, and they even stick under water just fine.
If you put their foot under water, they grab on.
How do they do it then? Believe it or not, they grab on by intermolecular forces, by Van der Waals forces.
What we're doing is, we're taking that inspiration of the hairs, and with another colleague at Berkeley, we're manufacturing them.
And just recently we've made a breakthrough, where we now believe we're going to be able to create the first synthetic, self-cleaning, dry adhesive. Many companies are interested in this.
We also presented to Nike even.
One has a working fluid, water and ammonia, and the other is a condenser.
You heat up one side, the hot side.
The ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side.
You let it cool to room temperature, and then, as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side, it creates a powerful cooling effect.
So, it was a great idea that didn't work at all: it blew up.
Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong.
Now, there's a similar situation in the classical music world, because there are some people who think that classical music is dying.
And there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet.
And rather than go into statistics and trends, and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing, and the record companies that are folding, I thought we should do an experiment tonight.
And there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet.
And rather than go into statistics and trends, and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing, and the record companies that are folding, I thought we should do an experiment tonight.
Actually, it's not really an experiment, because I know the outcome.
Now comes the third group: people who never listen to classical music.
It's just simply not part of your life.
You might hear it like second-hand smoke at the airport ...
And the telephone. The telephone. If your mother calls on the miserable telephone, she calls and says, "Hello," you not only know who it is, you know what mood she's in.
You have a fantastic ear. Everybody has a fantastic ear.
So nobody is tone-deaf.
So he does it again.
Now, he gets excited.
That's excitement, don't worry about it.
Now, he gets to F-sharp, and finally he goes down to E, but it's the wrong chord -- because the chord he's looking for is this one, and instead he does ...
Now, we call that a deceptive cadence, because it deceives us.
I tell my students, "If you have a deceptive cadence, raise your eyebrows, and everybody will know."
And one of them said, "Because we were listening."
Think of it. 1,600 people, busy people, involved in all sorts of different things, listening, understanding and being moved by a piece by Chopin.
Now, that is something.
They say three percent of the population likes classical music.
If only we could move it to four percent, our problems would be over.
How would you walk? How would you talk? How would you be?
Didn't have to worry about what people thought about me.
And I said, "Boy, let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features," and thought that if we could address education, by leveraging the children, and bringing to the world the access of the computers, that that was really the thing we should do.
Never shown this picture before, and probably going to be sued for it.

Never shown this picture before, and probably going to be sued for it.
It's taken at three o'clock in the morning, without the permission of the company.
I say to myself, "What planet do you come from?"
Okay, there's not a person in this room -- I don't care how techie you are -- there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it. OK?
We all need help, even those of us who are very seasoned.
What he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently, and when they debug the programs, they come the closest to learning about learning.
That was very important, and in some sense, we've lost that.
Kids don't program enough and boy, if there's anything I hope this brings back, it's programming to kids.
That computer is unlike anything you've had, and does things -- there are four of them -- that you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power, and I hope that's picked up more by the industry.
That the reason that you want to be below two watts is that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body.
Dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic.
So we went to smaller ones. Uruguay, bless their hearts.
Small country, not so rich. President said he'd do it, and guess what?
He did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us, nothing specific about sunlight-readable, mesh-network, low-power, but just a vanilla laptop proposal.
Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.
And what he said, for me, was very moving.
He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ...
In South Africa, they have a phrase called Ubuntu.
Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says, the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me.
But if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window.

It's totally rad."
And my mother turned to me and said, "What language is he speaking?"
I said, "English, mum."
Take anything you want out of the suitcase.
It's your birthday present."
I'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt, but I found an inflatable sheep.

We went back to our hotel room, and Gene was showing Natasha also where Atlanta was.
This is the third night we were in Korea.
The first night we'd gotten a room for the kids right next to us.
This is a song that came about because I think it's difficult to be in the world and not be aware of what's going on, and the wars and so forth.
This song kind of came out of all of that.
And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record, which I still stand by, but this has got something else in it.
All my friends said, we are leaving because we are a target.
But I'm not going to the east, because I don't know Swahili.
I stay. If I go, I will be killed.
And that was the language of the war.
Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral, killing animals, the logging timbers and so on.
And what of important things -- I think all of you here have a cell phone.
And that was the language of the war.

And that is me, going to, hurrying to Uganda, to try to save that 4,000 material, with people carrying them on the bikes, bicycles.
And after that, we succeeded.
I housed that 4,000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University.
I housed that 4,000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University.
And after the war, I have been able to bring it back home, so that we continue our studies.
The second war came while we didn't expect it.
Sometimes, they are having a helicopter to supply them with ammunition and so on.
They used me to carry that, and I was doing counting, what comes from where, and where, and where.
I had only this equipment -- my satellite phone, my computer and a plastic solar panel -- that I hide it in the forest.
This is a very embarrassing talk, I know.
I don't know where to start, where to finish it.
When I was thinking to come here, what best title I wanted to say to my talk, I didn't find this.
So, that's what we're trying to simulate -- not Chris specifically, I should say, but humans in general.
Now, we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University, and we tried to start very simply.
What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk.

That stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen.
So, it's subject to gravity, has joints, etc.
If you just run the simulation, it will just collapse, like this.
We did get it to work eventually, after tweaking a bit here and there.
And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run.
So, what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped that's learning how to walk using artificial evolution.
At the beginning, it can't walk at all, but it will get better and better over time.
So, this is the one that can't walk at all.
Now, after five generations of applying evolutionary process, the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better.
So, this is the one that can't walk at all.

Generation 10 and it'll take a few steps more -- still not quite there.
Generation 10 and it'll take a few steps more -- still not quite there.
But now, after generation 20, it actually walks in a straight line without falling over.
That was the real breakthrough for us.
Now, at this stage, it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds.
What you see here is the character standing there, and there's an obstacle that we put in its way.
And what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle.
What you see here is the character standing there, and there's an obstacle that we put in its way.
And what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle.
Now, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right, which is what I'm doing now, here, it will fall over it in a completely different way.
What we really wanted was a full human body.
So we started the company.
We hired a team of physicists, software engineers and biologists to work on this, and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body, basically.

It's got to be relatively fast, so you can run it on a normal machine, but it's got to be accurate enough, so it looks good enough, basically.
I should add that it's very simple to add things like hair, clothes, etc., but what we've done here is use a very simple visualization, so you can concentrate on the movement.
Now, what I'm going to do right now, in a moment, is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens.
Nothing really interesting, basically.
The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it.
It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it.
So, this character now has motor skills in the upper body -- nothing in the legs yet, in this particular one.

So that's what you see here.
Now, it gets really interesting if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well.
So here, we've got the same character.
That's something that you cannot do right now.
At the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games.
What this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now.
Now, the angle will have changed a tiny bit, so you can see that the reaction is different.
Again, a push, now this time from the front.
And you see it falls differently.
Now, here's another one.
What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion, a strong force applied to the character, and have the character react to it in midair.
So that you don't have a character that looks limp, but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away, that looks kind of alive in midair as well.
That's one angle; here's another angle.
We now think that the realism we're achieving with this is good enough to be used in films.
And let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization.
Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding.
It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.
But this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month, and more than that, you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.
And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.
They really did a fantastic job.
If you're ever in Kentucky, there's, you can see a movie of the flood, and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.
Particularly, there's a place called Europa, which is -- Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter, where we see a very level ice surface, which looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean.
So, we believe that on Europa there is, in fact, a deep ocean.
And that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore.
And that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore.
Ocean -- probably the most likely place for life to originate, just as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa, to go down through the ice, find out who is swimming around in the ocean, whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters -- whatever there may be that's exciting --- or cephalopods.
But that's hard to do. Unfortunately, the ice is thick.
There are plans to do it, but it's hard.
Go out a bit further, you'll find that beyond the orbit of Neptune, way out, far from the Sun, that's where the real estate really begins.
You'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which, in what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud -- these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets when they fall close to the Sun. Mostly, they just live out there in the cold of the outer solar system, but they are biologically very interesting indeed, because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals, which are just the right ones for developing life.
So, what I'm proposing is that there is where we should be looking for life, rather than on Mars, although Mars is, of course, also a very promising and interesting place.
But we can look outside, very cheaply and in a simple fashion.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
But we can look outside, very cheaply and in a simple fashion.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa, and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa, and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years.
It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface, just as it did on the Earth.
There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa, and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years.
It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface, just as it did on the Earth.
Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years, finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great -- much greater freedom, and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean.

Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years, finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great -- much greater freedom, and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean.
And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy, but it happened.
They'd need, first of all, to have a thick skin to protect themselves from losing water through the skin.
So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin.
But better -- what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight.
So I have proposed to apply the same trick to looking for life in the universe.
That if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces -- either on Europa, or further out, anywhere where you can live on a cold surface -- those creatures must be provided with reflectors.
In order to concentrate sunlight, they have to have lenses and mirrors -- in order to keep themselves warm.
Why aren't we doing it? Simply because nobody thought of it yet.
But I hope that we shall look, and with any -- we probably won't find anything, none of these speculations may have any basis in fact.
But still, it's a good chance. And of course, if it happens, it will transform our view of life altogether.
Especially if you breathe air, it's very hard to get from planet A to planet B, because there's no air in between. But if you breathe air --  -- you're dead --  -- as soon as you're off the planet, unless you have a spaceship.
But if you live in a vacuum, if you live on the surface of one of these objects, say, in the Kuiper Belt, this -- an object like Pluto, or one of the smaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto, and you happened -- if you're living on the surface there, and you get knocked off the surface by a collision, then it doesn't change anything all that much.
You still are on a piece of ice, you can still have sunlight and you can still survive while you're traveling from one place to another.
That would be a fun thing to do.
In the long run, of course, it would also make it possible for us to move out there.
What's going to happen in the end, it's not going to be just humans colonizing space, it's going to be life moving out from the Earth, moving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life, of course, is going to be the universe. And if life is already there, it makes it much more exciting, in the short run.

But in the long run, if there's no life there, we create it ourselves.
17 who were happily in love, 15 who had just been dumped, and we're just starting our third experiment: studying people who report that they're still in love after 10 to 25 years of marriage.
So, this is the short story of that research.
In the jungles of Guatemala, in Tikal, stands a temple.
They pine for love, they live for love, they kill for love, and they die for love.
As Walt Whitman once said, he said, "Oh, I would stake all for you."
Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies.
So, several years ago, I decided to look into the brain and study this madness.
Our first study of people who were happily in love has been widely publicized, so I'm only going to say a very little about it.
We found activity in a tiny, little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area.
It's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain, associated with wanting, with motivation, with focus and with craving.
In fact, the same brain region where we found activity becomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine.
But romantic love is much more than a cocaine high -- at least you come down from cocaine.
You lose your sense of self.
You can't stop thinking about another human being.
Somebody is camping in your head.
You know, you're lying there, you're looking at the picture, and you're in this machine, and you're calculating, you know, what went wrong.
How, you know, what have I lost?
As a matter of fact, Lucy and I have a little joke about this.
I've also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction: a perfectly wonderful addiction when it's going well, and a perfectly horrible addiction when it's going poorly.
And indeed, it has all of the characteristics of addiction.
You focus on the person, you obsessively think about them, you crave them, you distort reality, your willingness to take enormous risks to win this person.
I think there's biology to that.
I think we're going to end up, in the next few years, to understand all kinds of brain mechanisms that pull us to one person rather than another.
So, I will close with this. These are my older people.
Women get intimacy from face-to-face talking.
We swivel towards each other, we do what we call the "anchoring gaze" and we talk.
This is intimacy to women.
I think it comes from millions of years of standing behind that -- sitting behind the bush, looking straight ahead, trying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock.
I think, for millions of years, men faced their enemies, they sat side by side with friends.
So my final statement is: love is in us.
You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems.
The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology, horribly used.
The problem is not technology.
Was there a God?
A few years ago, a university student asked me, "What is the greatest surprise in your life?"
And I said, "The greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life.
And now I'm ready, when I hear that call, to go into the presence of God.
Thank you, and God bless all of you.
Thank you for the privilege. It was great.

Brain magic. What's brain magic all about?
Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects.
Kathryn, there was no way you could see through that blindfold.
KT: OK, but don't say my name like that. KB: But you're OK?
KT: Yes.
KT: OK, but don't say my name like that. KB: But you're OK?
KT: Yes.
KB: No way to see through it? KT: No.
But because your brains are not trained in the art of deception, the solutions you come up with will, 99 percent of the time, be way off the mark.
This is because magic is all about directing attention.
If, for instance, I didn't want you to look at my right hand, then I don't look at it.
Allow your eyes to close, on five, four, three, two, one.
Close your eyes right now.
OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you, I'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity, so our minds are along the same lines.
Close your eyes right now.
OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you, I'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity, so our minds are along the same lines.
And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind, I'm going to take your left hand, and just place it up here.
and further, and further.
Excellent.
I want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop.
And only when you feel the pressure go back, allow your hand to drift back to the tabletop, but only when you feel the pressure.
OK, that was wonderfully done. Let's try it again.
Excellent. Now that you've got the idea, let's try something even more interesting.
We're going to try an experiment in psychokinesis, right now.
Come right over here, next to me. Excellent.
Now, have a look at the Coke bottle.
Come right over here, next to me. Excellent.
Now, have a look at the Coke bottle.
Make sure it is solid, there's only one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle.
Now, have a look at the Coke bottle.
Make sure it is solid, there's only one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle.
And you can whack it against the table, if you want; be careful.
In a moment, you'll feel a certain sensation, OK, and when you feel that sensation, I want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle.
Think of that guy, that ba -- that guy.
I'm trying to be good here.
You didn't react to that, so it's four letters.
Think of one of the letters in the title.
There's a K in his name, there is a K.
Thank you.
I've got one more thing to share with you right now.
Actually, Chris, I was going to pick you for this, but instead of picking you, can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment?
They'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny.
No, stay around, OK.
Now, Steve, look back.
This time you can have three words.
Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"
"Not good enough." And that's what I'm going to be talking about.
So that was not good.
And so, that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert, Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology, which has three aims.
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness.

The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness.
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage.
It should be interested in the best things in life.
That's what Aristotle was talking about.
And third, the meaningful life.
So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them.
When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at 9:30 in the morning, time stops for him. And it stops till the closing bell.
When the first card is played, until 10 days later, the tournament is over, time stops for Len.
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about, about flow. And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way.
The second path is eudaimonian flow.
And the third path is meaning.
This is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally.
I doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that's in this picture, but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw, of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.
It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people, to begin to piece together our past.
We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.
We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.
When we find a fossil, we mark it.
Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS.
We mark it with a GPS fix, and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen, so we could essentially put it back on the surface, exactly where we found it.
And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.
When we then find something very important, like the bones of a human ancestor, we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly, using dental picks and fine paintbrushes.

And he remained there until 1.6 million years later, when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu, walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.
It's actually this little piece up here on the top.
Well, an excavation was begun immediately, and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment.
Last May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska, the northernmost settlement in the United States, with a family of Inupiat Eskimos, documenting their annual spring whale hunt.
This is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore, camping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice.
And that water that you see there is the open lead, and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.

So, stories have characters. Stories have concepts.
Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts.
They have colors. What do they look like?
A 53-year-old farmer. She was chaffing wheat, and that pile of wheat behind her had taken her about a week to make.
She wanted to keep farming until she dies.
You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here.
You can talk about creationism -- which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience, at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it -- or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z.
And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.
But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us.
Because if architecture is what I believe it to be, which is the built form of our cultural ambitions, what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?
And our own opportunity to make something new there?
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.
That's because it's cheaper.
Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer, a program that says, manufacture these parts.
The computer then talks to a machine -- a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine -- that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice, because the computer is just a machine.

It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.
And when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.
So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.
So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.
There are only 16 different pieces of wood, only 16 different assembly parts here.
Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.
It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.

It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks.
It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks.
It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas, where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.
Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations, this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center, replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street, that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.
They were able to create something wonderful.
They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York, using the same technology.
Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night.
Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.
Every single surface of this restaurant is white.
It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch.
Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco, up on the Upper West Side, with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go, like that.
Let's see it one more time.
And if you take all these things that are impossible, I think one of the things that we're learning from this era, from this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible, because we're unprepared for it.
So, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days.
But if that's happened in the last 5,000 days, what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?
If there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines, but that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.
And so I began to think about that.
And it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we've ever made.
Well, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell, but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet, if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet.
There's two million emails per second.
So it's a very big number.
So, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things.
I have three kind of general things I would like to say, three consequences of this.
First, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying.
The second thing is that -- some people call this the cloud, and you're kind of touching the cloud with this.
And so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook.
And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.
And if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has in terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah -- all these things are going to become Web based.
They're going through the machine.
And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web.
So that's what we were doing.
We're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about, and that is where we link the data.
So, I don't know what the name of this thing is.
So now, in this new one, when I link to it, I would link to my particular flight, my particular seat.
And so, giving an example of this thing, I live in Pacifica, rather than -- right now Pacifica is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere.
The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town, and that it's a specific town that I live in, but that's what we're going to be talking about.
So I'll give you one kind of an example.
There's like a billion social sites on the Web.
Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are.
And you should have all the networks of all the relationships between those pieces of data.
That's what we're moving into -- where it sort of knows these things down to that level.
A semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph -- we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.
But when six billion humans are Googling, who's searching who? It goes both ways.
So we are the Web, that's what this thing is.
We are going to be the machine.
We are going to be the machine.
So the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better.
Just like it wasn't TV and only better.
So the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better.
Just like it wasn't TV and only better.
The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web but only better -- it's going to be something different.
Just like it wasn't TV and only better.
The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web but only better -- it's going to be something different.
And I think it's going to be smarter.
The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web but only better -- it's going to be something different.
And I think it's going to be smarter.
It'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.
And I think it's going to be smarter.
It'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.
But it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.
It'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.
But it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.
Secondly, it's become much more personalized.
And thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous in terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it.
And all these devices will be portals into that.
So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just "the Web, only better," but a new kind of stage in this development.
And all these devices will be portals into that.
So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just "the Web, only better," but a new kind of stage in this development.
It looks more global. If you take this whole thing, it is a very big machine, very reliable machine, more reliable than its parts.
So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just "the Web, only better," but a new kind of stage in this development.
It looks more global. If you take this whole thing, it is a very big machine, very reliable machine, more reliable than its parts.
But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.

It looks more global. If you take this whole thing, it is a very big machine, very reliable machine, more reliable than its parts.
But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.
So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system, more as if this wasn't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with. It's a "One."
And I don't know what else to call it, than the One.
We'll have a better word for it.
But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge.
And again, I don't want to talk about consciousness, I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria, or a volvox, which is what that organism is.
So, to do, action, take-away. So, here's what I would say: there's only one machine, and the Web is its OS.
All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web.
How is the brain able to do this?
Let's just take a look about how the brain works, and then I'll compare that with how computers work.
So, this clip is from the PBS series, "The Secret Life of the Brain."
And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it.
And these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore.
Now, this pore can open and close.
And these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore.
Now, this pore can open and close.
But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady -- it's a sporadic flow of current.
And even when you close the pore -- which neurons can do, they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity -- even when it's closed, because these ions are so small, they can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time.
So, what you have is that when the pore is open, you get some current sometimes.
These are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in.
Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen, and technology has really benefitted from that.
But what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small, that it corresponds to only one electron at a time can flow through that channel, and that corresponds to a single ion channel.
And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel.
So even when you go to these crappy devices where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up, there's redundancy in the network that can actually recover the missing information.
It makes the brain inherently robust.
What you have here is a system where you store data locally.
In fact, the processing that happens in that little piece of brain is very similar to the kind of processing that computers do when they stream video over the Internet.
They want to compress the information -- they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on -- and that is how your eyeball is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve, to send to the rest of the brain.
Instead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms, we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina.
And the chip -- I'm going to show you a video that the silicon retina put out of its output when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul, who's the student who designed this chip.
Let me explain what you're going to see, OK, because it's putting out different kinds of information, it's not as straightforward as a camera.
The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.
Let me explain what you're going to see, OK, because it's putting out different kinds of information, it's not as straightforward as a camera.
The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.
It extracts regions with dark contrast, which will show up on the video as red.
It extracts regions with dark contrast, which will show up on the video as red.
And it extracts regions with white or light contrast, which will show up on the video as green.
This is Kareem's dark eyes and that's the white background that you see here.
What is origami?
Most people think they know what origami is. It's this: flapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.
And that is what origami used to be.

And that is what origami used to be.

But it's become something else.
It's become an art form, a form of sculpture.
The common theme -- what makes it origami -- is folding is how we create the form.
That is, people applied mathematical principles to the art, to discover the underlying laws.
And that leads to a very powerful tool.
The secret to productivity in so many fields -- and in origami -- is letting dead people do your work for you.
And this guy's on display downstairs, so take a look if you get a chance.
The most powerful tools in origami have related to how we get parts of creatures.
And I can put it in this simple equation.
We take an idea, combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.
What matters is what we mean by those symbols.
And you might say, "Can you really be that specific?
And yeah, you really can.
So how do we do that? Well, we break it down into a few smaller steps.
So let me stretch out that equation.
This base has a lot of flaps in it.
We're going to learn how to make one flap.
How would you make a single flap?
This base has a lot of flaps in it.
We're going to learn how to make one flap.
How would you make a single flap?
If I make the flap as skinny as possible, I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.
And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.
There's other ways of making flaps.

If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.

If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.
And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.
It's so simple that a computer could do it.
And you say, "Well, you know, how simple is that?"
But computers -- you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms, and with this, we could.

So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.

It's free. It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.

And you just draw a stick figure, and it calculates the crease pattern.
And I want to show you some of these examples.
One of the earliest was this pattern, this folded pattern, studied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer.
He studied a folding pattern, and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure.
It's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope in 1995.
Now, there is actually a little origami in the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple.
The telescope, going up in space, it unfolds in two places.
They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.
But if you want to go higher and go larger than this, then you might need some origami.
Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger.
The design called for geosynchronous orbit 25,000 miles up, 100-meter diameter lens.
So, imagine a lens the size of a football field.
There were two groups of people who were interested in this: planetary scientists, who want to look up, and then other people, who wanted to look down.
Whether you look up or look down, how do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket.
And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller.
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?
And that works whether you're going into space, or whether you're just going into a body.
And this example is the latter.
This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You at Oxford University.
Well, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology.
Digging things up out of the ground, and largely on the basis of morphology -- the way things are shaped, often skull shape -- saying, "This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.
This must be who I'm directly descended from."
It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.
It's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.
And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.
How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.
A haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes -- a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.
And the whole thing, if you add it all together, is over six billion nucleotides long.
A haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes -- a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.
And the whole thing, if you add it all together, is over six billion nucleotides long.
If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body, and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.
Now multiply it by 100.
And imagine copying that by hand.
And you're working away until late at night, and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee and you're paying attention, but, occasionally, when you're copying this by hand, you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake -- substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.
What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?
Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.
The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.
A slightly later migration up into the Middle East.
These would have been savannah hunters.
So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours, you'll get to see what a real savannah is like.
We've just connected the dots. What we need to do is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more -- hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world."
And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project.
The project launched in April 2005.
He mounted a camera on the tail.
A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy, by Sam Abell.
Pygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson.
We got back on shore; he was fine.
We were a little bit rattled.
But this flashbulb memory, as it's called, is when all the elements came together to define not just the event, but my emotional connection to it.
I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me."
I thought I was a hero.
So, this represents -- this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists, working at the very top of their craft -- except one.
Annie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd.
And they only came for the ivory.
This is actually one of the rangers.

Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand, where commercial fishing had been banned -- the result being that the overfished species have been restored, and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.
Photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial.
James Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED, took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.
From here, the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany, where they meet up with their families for the first time.
And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals, such as here in Walter Reed.
And finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis, they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre-war lives.
For most of my research career, I've been using accelerators, such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road, to study things on the smallest scale.
But more recently, I've been turning my attention to the universe on the largest scale.
Because, as I'll explain to you, the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected.
So we have these stars going around in circles like this.
As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK -- that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed than those that are further out here, OK.
So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars, that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.
So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars, that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.
In other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance -- this is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK -- we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases from the center of the galaxy.
When those measurements are made, instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant, as a function of distance.
When those measurements are made, instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant, as a function of distance.
If it's constant, that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see.
In fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.
But that cannot account for the mass either.
In fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there is in the ordinary matter, OK.
It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.
In fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here in the form of this invisible or dark matter as there is in the ordinary matter, OK.
It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.
I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK, to try to remind you that it's there.
So here's an observer: it could be an eye; it could be a telescope.
And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe.
How do we see that galaxy?
How do we see that galaxy?
A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye.
Now, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?
And so, this is your instrument, OK.
But ignore the top part.
It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.
But ignore the top part.
It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.
So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass, I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.
That's what the expansion of the universe or space means.
So they're moving further apart.
Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well, is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.
Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well, is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.
But because gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space, it tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK.
So the expansion slows down with time.
Now, we look for these dark matter particles because, after all, they are here in the room, OK, and they didn't come in the door.
They just pass through anything.
They can come through the building, through the Earth -- they're so non-interacting.
So one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.
So a crystal that will ring if that happens.
So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector.
Yeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake.
But now I'm glad I remember it.
So, this deck is bought here. Sorry.
Seven of?  LG: Diamonds, good. I start here.
Good, thank you.
The thing I did -- I peeked.
Another person.
LG: Pardon?
LG: Ten of diamonds, yeah.
Dogs have interests.
They have interest sniffing each other, chasing squirrels.
And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction.
I mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.
So, this whole dominance issue -- number one, what we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system.
And they take this stuff seriously.
And I've taught her "Phoenix," "come here," "take this," "go to" and the name of my son, "Jamie."
And the dog can take a note, and I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.
He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know, wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something, and take him a little message that says, "Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner."
And the dog can take a note, and I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.
He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know, wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something, and take him a little message that says, "Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner."
So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.
Then I have my own personal doorman, chauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter."
And now the dog's really happy.
And this, to me, is always what training is.
People here get very confused about what a punishment is.
They think a punishment is something nasty.
I bet a lot of you do, right?
They think a punishment is something nasty.
I bet a lot of you do, right?
You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.

You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.
It doesn't have to be.
You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.
It doesn't have to be.
There's several definitions of what a punishment is, but one definition, the most popular, is: a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior, such that it's less likely to occur in the future.
It doesn't have to be.

It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.
And I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.
I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.
And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital, plus the brother-in-law, plus the child.

She never raised her voice.
If she did, she would have got bitten.
It's not a good dog you shout at.
These relationship skills are so easy.
I mean, we as humans, our shallowness when we choose a life-mate based on the three Cs -- coat color, conformation, cuteness.
You know, kind of like a little robot.
No different from the dog barking.
The husband won't clear up his clothes, or the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK?
And it then starts, and we get into this thing, and our personal feedback -- there's two things about it.
The husband won't clear up his clothes, or the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK?
And it then starts, and we get into this thing, and our personal feedback -- there's two things about it.
When you watch people interacting with animals or other people, there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.
When you watch people interacting with animals or other people, there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.
And when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty.
You see it's especially in families, especially with spouses, especially with children, especially with parents.
Probably easier -- if you got a Rottie -- much easier to train.
Your kids are easy to train.
All you've got to do is to watch them, to time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes, you ask the question, "Is it good, or is it bad?"
His maybe most famous recording was something called "The Goldberg Variations."
Bach only wrote themes and variations one time.
He wrote some early pieces, but late in his life, in his mature period, he said, "Here's a theme -- 30 variations."
There's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side, and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano.
Without putting dates next to these things, step-by-step music will be turned into data, like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years.
Audio has come very late to this game -- I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering.

Audio has come very late to this game -- I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering.
And I don't know the answer to that, so I'm not going to tell you.
I will say that life involves computation.
So this is a computer program.
And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true, there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you.
But one, to me, that's most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development -- the output.
A small mutation can take a two-wing fly and make it a four-wing fly.
If we succeed, what will molecular programming look like?
You're going to sit in front of your computer.
You're going to design something like a cell phone, and in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone.
You're going to sit in front of your computer.
You're going to design something like a cell phone, and in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone.
Then you're going to have a compiler that's going to take that description and it's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed.
And here's how we do it.
This is part of that genome.
We add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples.
So, they're all floating around in solution, and to look at them, you have to get them on a surface where they stick.
So, you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface, and we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope.
It's got a needle, like a record needle, that goes back and forth over the surface, bumps up and down, and feels the height of the first surface.
So if you want to build a human from DNA origami, the problem is, you need a long strand that's 10 trillion trillion bases long.
That's three light years' worth of DNA, so we're not going to do this.
We're going to turn to another technology, called algorithmic self-assembly of tiles.
You can use DNA origami for that.
You can encode the number 32 in the right-hand side of a DNA origami, and when you add those tiles that count, they will start to count -- they will read that 32 and they'll stop at 32.
So, what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going.
You can encode the number 32 in the right-hand side of a DNA origami, and when you add those tiles that count, they will start to count -- they will read that 32 and they'll stop at 32.
So, what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going.
It knows when to stop growing because it can count.
Here is a DNA origami rectangle, and here are some tiles growing from it.
And you can see how they count.
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 10, 11, 12, 17.
Now, those questions, which, of course, you've got right, and you haven't been conferring, and so on.
And I -- you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate, but maybe not in this instance.
A little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff, 99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air.
Oh, you're all shaking your heads, but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly.
Other ones are kind of going like this. All right.
It's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun are spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth.
And this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar.
I hope you notice the coincidence here.
What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception, right, in their heads, of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children?
And the second question to that then is, ensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down.
Ah ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue? All right?
And you've all got an idea in your head of the answer.
But that's expensive and to understand what the potential is --  -- it is expensive. But people are willing to pay that!
You know, one -- we have a very unique period in time today.
For the first time ever, we have enough wealth concentrated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow us to really drive space exploration.
And this is something that we're very excited about.
I showed this slide to Larry Page, who just joined our board.
And you know, when you give to a nonprofit, you might have 50 cents on the dollar.
And that's huge. And then he turned around and said, "Well, if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize, you get 500 to one."
I said, "Well, that's great."
So, we have actually -- are looking to turn the X PRIZE into a world-class prize institute.
I said, "Well, that's great."
So, we have actually -- are looking to turn the X PRIZE into a world-class prize institute.
This is what happens when you put up a prize, when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials.
It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize, the beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee, and you pay on success.
Orteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across -- tried to go across the Atlantic, and we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE.
So, prizes work great.
JF: Over on the left-hand side, you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off.
And on the right-hand side, there's a scale that shows the rocket's velocity.
The rocket's position is shown by the trajectory that we're now looking at.
PH: You know, so much was worked out: the first real-time interaction, the video display, pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer, but unfortunately, it was too pricey for the Navy, and all of this would have been lost if it weren't for a happy coincidence.
Enter the atomic bomb.
We're threatened by the greatest weapon ever, and knowing a good thing when it sees it, the Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us.
Or there's one other marketing proposition: if you don't use our product, you'll die.
This is a really good example of that.
This had the first pointing device. It was distributed, so it worked out -- distributed computing and modems -- so all these things could talk to each other.
This is a really good example of that.

About 20 percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing, and it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes.
I assure you, that's not the case.
Turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your Winky Dink Magic Window, other crayons may discolor or hurt the window.
This proprietary principle of vendor lock-in would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere.
We're now right into the 1960s.
It's the era of big business and data centers for computing.
But all that was about to change.
A prototyping tool? A scripted language?
Heck, it was everything. So we ended up writing a marketing brochure.
We asked a question about how the mind works, and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant.
We were plenty aware that we were messing with media, and on the surface, it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things, but we also missed an awful lot. Let's take a look.
Narrator: The pyramids, the Colosseum, the New York subway system and TV dinners, ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all.
Yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology, the Digital Superhighway.
At stake: the battle for you, the consumer, and the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of America.  PH: We missed a lot. You know, you missed, we missed the Internet, the long tail, the role of the audience, open systems, social networks.
It just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media.
Thomas Edison had the same problem.
MM: The medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this.
They don't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up.
They think of the old medium, because the old medium is always the content of the new medium, as movies tend to be the content of TV, and as books used to be the content, novels used to be the content of movies.
And these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part, are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.
They are very territorially aggressive.
Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature, have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.
What we buy. What we wear.
And choose to make these choices with the question, how will this affect the environment around me?
How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?
One, two, three, four, five -- about eight or 10.
OK. This is a bit of a problem.
Because if our goal is to understand the world, to seek a deeper understanding of the world, our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder.
OK. This is a bit of a problem.
Because if our goal is to understand the world, to seek a deeper understanding of the world, our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder.
Because when people all share values, when people all share morals, they become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams, it shuts down open-minded thinking.
So anyway, let's go with the red pill.
Let's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us.
Let's start at the beginning.
I believe these are the five best candidates for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind.
I think this is what we come with, at least a preparedness to learn all of these things.
But as my son, Max, grows up in a liberal college town, how is this first draft going to get revised?
Which shows that within any country, the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness.
Everybody -- I mean, we debate over what's fair -- but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter.
Moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity.
But then -- and here's the trick -- Fehr and Gachter said, on the seventh round, they told people, "You know what? New rule.
If you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren't contributing, you can do that."
And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on, cooperation shoots up.
So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.
They want change and justice, even at the risk of chaos.
This guy's shirt says, "Stop bitching, start a revolution."
Conservatives, on the other hand, speak for institutions and traditions.
They want order, even at some cost to those at the bottom.
The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve.
Step out.
And if you do that, that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility, to get yourself out of this self-righteousness, which is the normal human condition.
Think about the Dalai Lama.
So I think the point -- the point of my talk, and I think the point of TED -- is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better.
People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place.
But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth.
Most of the animals are in the oceans.
Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea, at the bottom of the sea.
The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places, than it is in the rainforests.
Marcel Proust said, "The true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes."
People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes, not only on what exists -- the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea -- but also how we think about life on the planet itself.
Here's a jelly.
Here's a jelly.
It's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.
This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.
It gets up to about 150 feet long.
But see all those different working things?
I love that kind of stuff.
But see all those different working things?
I love that kind of stuff.
It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.
I love that kind of stuff.
It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.
It's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.
This is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called.
And you can sit in a room like this, with a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time.
One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world -- this world, this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory.

One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world -- this world, this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory.
Because we see it in bits and pieces right now.
This pressure thing really amazes me -- that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can.
What we saw up till now was from the Pacific.
This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth.
I just can't get over this -- that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away.
This stuff is toxic as hell, by the way.
You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean, and it's coming out all from it.
But by 1949, the Soviet Union had decided it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power, and they began to match what the United States had developed.
And from 1949 to 1985 was an extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagined back in the 1940s.
So by 1985 -- each of those red bombs up here is equivalent of a thousands warheads -- the world had 65,000 nuclear warheads, and seven members of something that came to be known as the "nuclear club."
So we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal among many countries around the world, but a very different set of circumstances.
So I'm going to talk about a nuclear threat story in two chapters.
Chapter one is 1949 to 1991, when the Soviet Union broke up, and what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years, was a superpowers' nuclear arms race.
And what happened was -- when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear threat era, which started back in 1945.
Chapter two starts in 1991.
When the Soviet Union broke up, we effectively lost that adversary as a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part.
You put the elements into a suitcase.
It becomes very portable.
The suitcase can be conveniently dropped in your trunk of your car.
You take it wherever you want to take it, and you can detonate it.
You don't want to build a suitcase bomb, and you happen to get one of those insecure nuclear warheads that exist.
This is the size of the "Little Boy" bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima.
You take it wherever you want to take it, and you can detonate it.
You don't want to build a suitcase bomb, and you happen to get one of those insecure nuclear warheads that exist.
This is the size of the "Little Boy" bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima.
And what I'm going to focus on, as I come to conclusion here, is that, what happens to you if you're in here?
Well, if we're talking about the old days of an all-out nuclear attack, you, up here, are as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point.
My point now, though, is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here, if you've survived the initial blast.
So if there's any way that you can avoid, like, avert your eyes, that would be a good thing.
If you find yourself alive, but you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon, you have -- that's gone off -- you have 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size and exactly where it went off, to get out of the way before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up.
In that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do -- and I mean this seriously -- is go about a mile away from the blast.
And this is a real crisis for them.
And that's where the hyena comes in.
The hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world.
I went to the Washington Zoo.
Richard said, "I want you to get up close and personal with this camel.
I want you to inspect its mouth, look at its teeth.
Most people think that the humps store water.
They don't. They store fat.
Now, I'm not a chemist, but basically what happens is the fat is oxidized by their breathing.
And so we started thinking.
Well, if poor old Suki is in search of a mate, what would Suki do to find the perfect mate?
I'm going to show you another film.
But I'm going to go over the technological, social and sort of where are we as a whole, trying to get to that particular vision.
And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website, the books, music, video and just go step -- media type by media type, just go and say, all right, how're we doing on this?
So if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we?
Well, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it?
If you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it?
Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world is the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.
So what I wanted to argue is, books are within our grasp.
The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal.
Yes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions, but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online.
And we've been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the Net.
In the United States, it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right?
If you give something to a charity or to the public, you get a pat on the back and a tax donation -- except on the Net, where you can go broke.
So anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from.
Mostly, people want to see their old stuff out of this.
If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one, which is probably best known for burning, is, don't just have one copy.
So we've started to -- we've made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria.
So this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria.
And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.
And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.
So, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco, flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ...
so we're hedging our bets here.
And I told her I was coming to TED, and she said, "What's the problem?"
And I said, "Well, I'm not sure."
I said, "I have to talk to them about stories.
Back then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story.
When Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story.
Have you been watching the commercials?



Little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar, big kids would spit in it -- neither happened.
When I took over this, I tried to really figure out, like, what my vision would be.
How do we really change children's relationship to food?
These are -- 10 companies control much of what's in our grocery stores, much of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem.
So when I started thinking about these issues and how I was going to change what kids ate, I really started focusing on what we would teach them.
And the very first thing was about regional food -- trying to eat food from within our region.
And if we're going to change it, and change how we feed kids, we really have to rethink that.
So, public and private partnerships, advocacy groups, working with foundations.
In our school district, the way we afford this is our school district allocates .03 percent of the general fund towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district allocated a half to one percent, we could start to really fix this program.
And before that, I was a silversmith, and before that, I was -- I was out of the house at about 15 and a half, and I never wound up going into college.
I didn't really -- I didn't see the point at the time.
I do now, after learning about all the quantum stuff.
That was a good one.
Anyway, finally settled on kind of this kind of a look, little poufy body, a little imaginary character.
And there he is, a little bush baby on -- caught in the headlights there.
And she still actually has those.
So I kind of retired, and we're already living in paradise up in Boise, on a river, you know. So and then I started another company called Toy Innovation and we did some projects with Mattel with actually with a lady who's here, Ivy Ross, and we did Miracle Moves Baby, made it in Wired magazine, did a bunch of other stuff.
And then I started another company.
If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard, and you say, "Well, what about thinking and emotions?"
Most people will say, "Emotions are terribly hard.
They're incredibly complex. They can't -- I have no idea of how they work.
And the people who avoid that have 30 percent less infectious disease or something.
Or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent.
So if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth, let's start with that. And since I got that idea, I've had to shake hundreds of hands.
DR: Close enough. Passion.
Right? Entrepreneurs, by definition, are people who are leaving something else, starting a new world, creating and putting their lifeblood into this thing.
You've got to convey passion.
I want to know that you have commitment.
That you are going to be here to the end.
I want you to say -- or I want you to convey -- that you are going to die if you have to, with your very last breath, your fingernails scratching as they draw you out.
But on top of that, I need realism, Because while changing the world is great, it doesn't always happen.
And before you get to change the world, bad things are going to take place; you have to deal with that.
And you have to have rational projections.
You can take them on an emotional -- all pitches, all sales presentations, are emotional at some level.
You can go up, you can go down, right?
And it goes from beginning to end.
First of all, none of these big, long-titled slides with blah, blah, I'm presenting to so-and-so on X date.
I know the day, I know who I am -- I don't need all that.
Just give me your company logo.
I want to know the size of the market. Why is this market worth getting at?
I want to know your product, that's very important.
Now, this is not a product pitch or sales pitch.
When they walked into the lab in Minnesota, they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes; both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee, both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists, both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after, and both of them liked to surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump.
Now -- the story might seem to good to be true, but when you administer batteries of psychological tests, you get the same results -- namely, identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities.
Now, given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question, why should it have been such an appealing notion?
So even if people did have impulses towards selfishness or greed, that's not the only thing in the skull, and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them.
In the book, I go over controversies such as this one, and a number of other hot buttons, hot zones, Chernobyls, third rails, and so on -- including the arts, cloning, crime, free will, education, evolution, gender differences, God, homosexuality, infanticide, inequality, Marxism, morality, Nazism, parenting, politics, race, rape, religion, resource depletion, social engineering, technological risk and war.
And needless to say, there were certain risks in taking on these subjects.
Well, here's a diagnosis.
They didn't ask me, but by their own admission, they need all the help that they can get.
And I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence that this supposed decline in the elite arts and criticism occurred in the same point in history in which there was a widespread denial of human nature.
And I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence that this supposed decline in the elite arts and criticism occurred in the same point in history in which there was a widespread denial of human nature.
A famous quotation can be found -- if you look on the web, you can find it in literally scores of English core syllabuses -- "In or about December 1910, human nature changed."
A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf, and there's some debate as to what she actually meant by that.
Here's what I mean. Politics and -- let's focus on the political system in particular question here, which is the system of democracy.
Democracy, as a type of politics, is a technology for the control and deployment of power.
You can deploy power in a wide range of ways.
It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room, or Muslims out in the rest of the world -- I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are -- conceptualize Islam.
It will be transformative of Islam as well.
And as a result of this convergence, this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together, there's a real possibility that, instead of a clash of Islamic civilization -- if there is such a thing -- and democratic civilization -- if there is such a thing -- we'll in fact have close compatibility.
Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens, it cannot be the right strategy, either pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war, "Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out, because we opposed the war in the first place."
That's not the way human circumstances operate.
You face the circumstances you have in front of you and you go forward.

Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space, architecture is nothing but a special-effects machine that delights and disturbs the senses.
Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes.
And we ask the question, can we use technology, high technology, to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition, that also challenges the conventions of space and skin, and rethinks our dependence on vision?
So this is how we sought to do it.
Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles, 35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure.
It reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, dew point, and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout.
And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather.
So, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure.
So, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why.
Now, here we go, one side, the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space was.
Unlike entering any normal space, entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium.
We really wanted to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense, and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses.
You know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell, because the Swiss said, "Well, why are we going to spend, you know, 10 million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate?"
And, you know, we thought -- well, we tried to convince them.
You know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell, because the Swiss said, "Well, why are we going to spend, you know, 10 million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate?"
And, you know, we thought -- well, we tried to convince them.
And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know, it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of.
It's the ICA -- the Institute of Contemporary Art -- in Boston, which is on the waterfront.
And there's not enough time to really introduce the building, but I'll simply say that the building negotiates between this outwardly focused nature of the site -- you know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston -- and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum.
So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking -- I mean that's its primary objective, both its program and its architectural conceit.

But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone.
This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by 2010.
And for the purposes of this talk, I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects, and it happens to be our current obsession, and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction.
It puts a human face on issues which, from afar, can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact.
What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power, happens to ordinary citizens one by one.
And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.
My TED wish. There’s a vital story that needs to be told and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era.
Thank you very much.

But our school at that time got a grant from the government, and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3DZ -- and they left the programming manuals lying around.
And so students like myself with nothing to do, we would learn how to program it.
Also around this time, at home, this was the computer that people were buying.
It was around this time we went from 1K to 16K, which was quite the leap.
And if you're wondering how much 16K is, this eBay logo here is 16K.
And in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program.
Then the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industry and Hollywood to actually work together on something -- instead of licensing from each other, to actually work.
Now, Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me, so I've done that.
The video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.
I brought some stuff on "World of Warcraft." It's 5.5 million players.
It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions.
It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer, making the publisher about another 275 million.
And this is happening in every city around the world.
This is happening in your local cities too, you're probably just not aware of it.
Now, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics have been improving.

Now, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics have been improving.
I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it.
But if you were to go to a game developers conference, what they're all talking about is emotion, purpose, meaning, understanding and feeling.
You'll hear about talks like, can a video game make you cry?
And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about.
Part of me is just waiting to let go.
I know though, that no matter how amazing video games may become, or how flat the real world may seem to us, that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug.
DP: Wow.
And it's a picture we've seen several times.
Basically, "Emergence" was published on 9/11.
I live right there in the West Village, so the plume was luckily blowing west, away from us.
This is not the future King of England, although it looks like it.
It's some guy, it's a GeoCities homepage of some guy that I found online who's interested, if you look at the bottom, in soccer and Jesus and Garth Brooks and Clint Beckham and "my hometown" -- those are his links.
But nothing really says this model of interactivity -- which was so exciting and captures the real, the Web Zeitgeist of 1995 -- than "Click here for a picture of my dog."
And he's tracking how many other weblogs linked to those weblogs, and so you have kind of an authority -- a weblog that has a lot of links to it is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it.
And so at any given time, on any given page on the Web, actually, you can say, what does the weblog community think about this page?
And you can get a list.
This is what they think about my site; it's ranked by blog authority.
You can also rank it by the latest posts.
So when I was talking in "Emergence," I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture that, basically, you could link to somebody else but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them.
And that was one of the reasons why the web wasn't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things.
Well, something like Technorati is supplying that.
Now what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger, where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web -- there's nothing artificial.
So since I tell stories, let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point -- Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson.
As for that first sphere of work, I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing.
He had a huge ambition.
But only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion -- but followed by other cultures as well -- that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life, you could live on in the memory of others.
Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence.
And that worthy ambition became his lodestar.
And yet, roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam.
And because he was so sad and so vulnerable, he opened up to me in ways he never would have had I known him at the height of his power -- sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries.
And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure, that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then.
For on the surface, Lyndon Johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years, in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency; he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted; he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside, a penthouse in the city, sailboats, speedboats.
He had servants to answer any whim, and he had a family who loved him deeply.
And yet, years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies.
And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument.
One of his favorite stories, for example, had to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen.
And as Lincoln told the story, Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war.
He said, "No problem. It wasn't a religious service."
But then, unfortunately, he said, "And what else, my child?"
And then came my second sin.
Or again, the collapse of the Soviet Union took place within a couple of decades, maybe within a decade, of the time when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power.
An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish.
These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption, or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential.
And my answer is, the most important thing we need to do is to forget about there being any single thing that is the most important thing we need to do.
Instead, there are a dozen things, any one of which could do us in.
And we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11, we fail to solve the 12th -- we're in trouble. For example, if we solve our problems of water and soil and population, but don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble.
This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the '70s.
And the interview was 40 pages long.
But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview.
For instance, a poet describes it in this form.
This is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the United States.
And it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.

This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky -- a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity, when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.
For instance, this is another student of mine, Susan Jackson from Australia, who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world.
And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater, the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person.
You don't think; it goes automatically, if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.
For a coral, branching into different copies is the most natural thing in the world.
Unlike us, a hyper-intelligent coral would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics.
The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works.
This quantum weirdness was first described by Erwin Schrödinger and his cat.
The cat likes this version better.
In this setup, Schrödinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that, by the laws of quantum mechanics, branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not.
These particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and anti-proton.
Any particles more massive than this energy limit aren't produced, and remain invisible to us.
This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting.
But if we plot them out according to their charges, some beautiful patterns emerge.
The most familiar charge is electric charge.
Electrons have an electric charge, a negative one, and quarks have electric charges in thirds.
Then we can spin these in eight dimensions, and see what the whole pattern looks like.
Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now related to the first generation by a symmetry called "triality."
This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics.
From their location in this pattern, we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle, but have color charge and interact with the strong force.
Filling in these new particles completes this pattern, giving us the full E8.
This E8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots.
One does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably won't end up being true about nature.
That's what doing theoretical physics is like: there are a lot of wipeouts.
In this regard, new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I probably understood two percent of that, but I still absolutely loved it. So I'm going to sound dumb.
Your theory of everything -- Garrett Lisi: I'm used to coral.
And that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see.
CA: But a string theorist, as I understand it, explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating -- I know you don't like string theory -- vibrating inside it.
How should we think of an electron in relation to E8?
CA: But a string theorist, as I understand it, explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating -- I know you don't like string theory -- vibrating inside it.
How should we think of an electron in relation to E8?
GL: No, it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape.
In Australia they did it -- this research company, called SymbioticA.
But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty.
And so, the assignment to the students was, how should the steak of tomorrow be?
The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun, and then he made laser sounds.
"Kew, kew, kew -- watch out."
And they turned at once and walked away.
And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him and giving him rectal probes.
This book became, naturally, an enormous best-seller.
This image by Ted Joseph was from that book, and was his, sort of, police sketch of what the creatures looked like that Whitley Strieber had described to him.
And so I sat down to wait.
I did not watch the skies, but the very end of the street where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along.
And I watched those constellations shift, hoping that they would part and I would see her face.


You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses, and one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.
Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine, there actually is a little wine in there -- and of course, always wears a tuxedo.
But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning -- one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters, but also comes in other forms.
A magazine?
So what do we mean by glamour?
Well, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the dictionary.
And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary, in this case the 1913 dictionary.
Glamour is a form of falsification, but falsification to achieve a particular purpose.
It may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film.
And it involves a great deal of technique.
Glamour doesn't have to be people.
Architectural photography -- Julius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration, took this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House.
Architectural photography is extremely glamorous.
The less experience we have with them, the more glamorous they are.
So you can do a glamorized picture of a car, but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.
You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.
The same thing -- arches are very glamorous.
Arches with stained glass -- even more glamorous.
Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous.
Part of the thing is that, in "Rear Window," the question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?
And the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie.
Here's Hedy Lamarr again.
And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.
Translucence is glamorous -- that's why all these people wear pearls.
It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent -- not transparent, not opaque.
It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent -- not transparent, not opaque.
It invites us into the world but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.
And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person, maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot, because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.
She's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology.
So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid, even though she thought she could look stupid.
David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash, which only took a fraction of a second to happen.
I want to try to combine them all, because to me, healing is really the ultimate natural wonder.
Your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself, and much more quickly than people had once realized, if you simply stop doing what’s causing the problem.
And so, really, so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet.
And to the degree that you can move in a healthy direction, you’re going to live longer, you’re going to feel better, you’re going to lose weight, and so on.
And in our studies, what we’ve been able to do is to use very expensive, high-tech, state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost -- and in many ways, ancient -- interventions, can be.
We first began by looking at heart disease, and when I began doing this work 26 or 27 years ago, it was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse.
Now I thought, you know, if we just did good science, that would change medical practice. But, that was a little naive.
It’s important, but not enough.
Because we doctors do what we get paid to do, and we get trained to do what we get paid to do, so if we change insurance, then we change medical practice and medical education.
Insurance will cover the bypass, it’ll cover the angioplasty; it won’t, until recently, cover diet and lifestyle.
So, we began through our nonprofit institute's training hospitals around the country, and we found that most people could avoid surgery, and not only was it medically effective, it was also cost effective.
And the insurance companies found that they began to save almost 30,000 dollars per patient, and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they’re paying for 1,800 people to go through the program on the sites that we train.
You’re going to take away my 20 friends? What are you going to give me?"
Or they eat when they get depressed, or they use alcohol to numb the pain, or they work too hard, or watch too much TV.
There are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain, but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem.
And telling people they’re going to die is too scary to think about, or, they’re going to get emphysema or heart attack is too scary, and so they don’t want to think about it, so they don’t.
The most effective anti-smoking ad was this one.
You’ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth, and "impotence" -- the headline is, "Impotent" -- it’s not emphysema.
The myth that you hear about is, Americans have been told to eat less fat, the percent of calories from fat is down, Americans are fatter than ever, therefore fat doesn’t make you fat.
It’s a half-truth. Actually, Americans are eating more fat than ever, and even more carbs. And so the percentage is lower, the actual amount is higher, and so the goal is to reduce both.
Dr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died, and we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs, the "bad carbs," and these are things like --  -- sugar, white flour, white rice, alcohol. And you get a double whammy: you get all these calories that don’t fill you up because you’ve removed the fiber, and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up.
I mean, there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren’t good for you.
You want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health rather than the one that harms it.
And the problem is that it’s based on this half-truth, which is that Americans eat too many simple carbs, so if you eat fewer simple carbs you’re going to lose weight.
And the biggest problem came in the last 25 years: it went from 25 percent up to that 97 percent.
And this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we, humans, are in charge of life on earth; we're like the capricious Gods of old Greek myths, kind of playing with life -- and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it.
Now, the third curve is information technology.
And then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with.
So, that's the stage out of all this. I find, for reasons I don't understand, I really do have a goal.
And the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable when my kids reach my age -- and I think that's -- in other words, the next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share.
Let me just rush very quickly through things that we've done.
Human-powered airplane -- Gossamer Condor sort of started me in this direction in 1976 and 77, winning the Kremer prize in aviation history, followed by the Albatross. And we began making various odd planes and creatures.
Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail.
I'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar-powered airplane -- 165 miles carrying a person from France to England as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part of our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors -- the Sunracer -- that won the race in Australia.
We got a lot of people thinking about electric cars, what you could do with them. A few years later, when we suggested to GM that now is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact, they sponsored it, and here's the Impact that we developed with them on their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial product.
With that preamble, let's show the first two-minute videotape, which shows a little airplane for surveillance and moving to a giant airplane.

With that preamble, let's show the first two-minute videotape, which shows a little airplane for surveillance and moving to a giant airplane.
Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance -- in effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble and launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.
In 1981, it flew 163 miles from Paris to England, solely on the power of sunbeams, and established a basis for the Pathfinder.
The message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less -- gains that can help us attain a desirable balance between technology and nature. The stakes are high as we speed toward a challenging future.
Buckminster Fuller said it clearly: "there are no passengers on spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew, can and must do more with less -- much less."
Ray Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii.
For those who live on the mainland, it was tough being away from home.
The friendly support, the quiet confidence, congenial hospitality shown by our Hawaiian and military hosts --  this is starting -- made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable.
the telemetry, the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it, we hope, with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice.
So Matt Keenan, just any time you're -- all right -- ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure that it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees.
You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it, looking out of its camera.
PM: But now we're trying to get the video. There we go.
MK: Can you bring up the house lights?
PM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better and be able to fly the plane better.
Where all this leads, I don't know. Is it practical? I don't know.
But like any basic research, when you're really forced to do things that are way beyond existing technology, you can get there with micro-technology, nanotechnology.
You can do amazing things when you realize what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales, you realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s -- but when you get down to the nature's realm, nature has 200 million years of experience.
But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible, we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world.
So, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors.
If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material -- if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise, and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed.
ZK: It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A., and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola.
He works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company, The Directors Bureau.
As we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side.
As we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side.
And we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand -- and you know, we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face: Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder; he opens it up and Keith and I look in, and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on.
These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking at these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good.
Narrator: Do you have a need for speed?
Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop.
Aqua Rocket: coming this summer.
Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop.
Aqua Rocket: coming this summer.
KS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this, and they asked us, when's it coming out?
It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system.
When you get to the very bottom of the slide --  -- the rider passes through an aluminum tube.
And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important from a technical standpoint.
So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you.
Now, you see the magnet fell really slowly.
Now, I'm not going to get into the physics of it, but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling, the greater the stopping force.
KS: Now the reason it's cold is that's it's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns -- it's a dry liquid developed by 3M.
It's perfectly clear, it's odorless, it's colorless.
It's so safe you could drink this stuff.
KS: So you see there, it didn't bounce back. Now, this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing.
It's technically called, "shape-retaining property."
Now, think about your interactions with aluminum foil.
ZK: For example, you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist, but doesn't use a buckle.
Taking it a little further, if you wove those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make a shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth: so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table, so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away.
For our next technology, it's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink.
Marcus: Because I do what I like?
Boy: Look man, reading don't feed no one.
And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.
So, for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.
How -- and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful, because you just need something to hold on to, especially in a society where you feel alienated.
Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe, the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about, and his reality.
CS: This is the gun.
C: This is an AK-47 rifle. This is your life.
This is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life.
CC: Mr. Gelehun, I’d like to remind you you’re not on trial here for any crimes you committed.
E: We were fighting for our freedom.
If killing in a war is a crime, then you have to charge every soldier in the world.
It’s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers; we take all our terrestrial hang-ups, all our constraints -- importantly, these two-dimensional constraints that we have, and they’re so constrained we don’t even understand it -- and we take them underwater.
You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat.
A seat works in a two-dimensional world, where gravity blasts down on that seat, OK?
And in a two-dimensional world, we do know about the third dimension but we don’t use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against gravity.
And then our mothers tell us, "Careful you don’t fall down" -- because you’ll fall over.
Now, go into the real atmosphere of this planet.
I turned around to check on my friend's house.
Then someone on the tracks screamed.
Before I could turn around, everyone on the tracks was screaming and running.
This may seem minor, but it is terrifying to hear rumor after rumor after rumor that another tidal wave, bigger than the last, will be coming at exactly 1 p.m., or perhaps tonight, or perhaps ...
You don't even know if it is safe to go back down to the water, to catch a boat to the hospital.
We think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed.
Now, I'm going to move now from this kind of -- the sublime in the traditional sense of the word, that is to say, awe-inspiring, terrifying -- to the somewhat more mundane.
Because when we think about blogs, I think for most of us who are concerned about them, we're primarily concerned with things like politics, technology, etc.
And I want to ask three questions in this talk, in the 10 minutes that remain, about the blogosphere.
And they can actually often be smarter than even the smartest person within them.
The simplest example of this is if you ask a group of people to do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar.
If I had a jar of jellybeans and I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar, your average guess would be remarkably good.
One of the fundamental characteristics of a network is that, once you are linked in the network, the network starts to shape your views and starts to shape your interactions with everybody else.
That's one of the things that defines what a network is.
A network is not just the product of its component parts.
That's one of the things that defines what a network is.
A network is not just the product of its component parts.
It is something more than that.
And networks make it harder for people to do that, because they drive attention to the things that the network values.
So, one of the phenomena that's very clear in the blogosphere is that once a meme, once an idea gets going, it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on, because other people have, say, a link.
People have linked to it, and so other people in turn link to it, etc., etc.
The metaphor that I like to use is the metaphor of the circular mill.
A lot of people talk about ants.
You know, this is a conference inspired by nature.
Because if we are the environment, then all we need to do is look around us and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other.
And so that’s the message that I had.
And I said, "Well, I'm going to have to spread that message."
And in fact, we’re going to do that exercise right now.
You all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper.
It’s actually got a bunch of circles on it.
He got exactly the same response: lots and lots of sorry’s.
And he would point this out as evidence that we fear the judgment of our peers, and that we’re embarrassed about showing our ideas to people we think of as our peers, to those around us.
And this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our thinking.
And this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our thinking.
So we might have a wild idea, but we’re afraid to share it with anybody else.
OK, so if you try the same exercise with kids, they have no embarrassment at all.
So they have the slide, and they even have a fireman’s pole.
Don’t know what they do with that, but they have one.
So all of these places have these symbols.
Don’t know what they do with that, but they have one.
So all of these places have these symbols.
Now, our big symbol at IDEO is actually not so much the place, it’s a thing.
So all of these places have these symbols.
Now, our big symbol at IDEO is actually not so much the place, it’s a thing.
And it’s actually something that we invented a few years ago, or created a few years ago.
We use it in a pretty pragmatic way, to be honest.
We think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions.
Helps us do our jobs better, and helps us feel better when we do them.
And they were doing that through building prototypes.
And building is the next of the behaviors that I thought I’d talk about.
So the average Western first-grader spends as much as 50 percent of their play time taking part in what’s called "construction play."
One of the reasons he chose to take this rather large video camera with him was because he didn’t want the doctors and nurses thinking he was actually sick, and sticking something into him that he was going to regret later.
So anyhow, he went there with his video camera, and it’s kind of interesting to see what he brought back.
Because when we looked at the video when he got back, we saw 20 minutes of this.
And so far, I admit, this might feel like it’s a message just to go out and play like a kid.
And to certain extent it is, but I want to stress a couple of points.
The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy.
And it’s been split up in successive bits and a chord.
So what you’re smelling now is the top note.
And then will come what they call the heart, the lush heart note.
It has one double bond, it has an alcohol on the end, so it’s "ol," and that’s why they call it cis-3-hexene-1-ol.
Once you figure this out, you can really impress people at parties.
This smells of cut grass. Now, this is the skeleton of the molecule.

This smells of cut grass. Now, this is the skeleton of the molecule.
If you dress it up with atoms, hydrogen atoms -- that’s what it looks like when you have it on your computer -- but actually it’s sort of more like this, in the sense that the atoms have a certain sphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel.
OK, now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass, OK?
Why doesn’t it smell of potatoes or violets? Well, there are really two theories.
But the first theory is: it must be the shape.
And that’s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape.
And when I first came across it in the early '90s, I thought my predecessor, Malcolm Dyson and Bob Wright, had really taken leave of their senses, and I’ll explain to you why this was the case.
However, I came to realize gradually that they may be right -- and I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so, but I’m working on it.
Here’s how shape works in normal receptors.
Now, you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs.
If it does, you put the glass down, you go to a different bar.
This is -- in other words, we never get the O-H -- we never mistake it for an S-H, OK?
Most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air, and when you call up the companies, they only give you minimum ten tons, OK?
So this was not what they call a laboratory-scale experiment, and they wouldn’t have liked it at my college.
However, I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually, and here is the beast.
So this was not what they call a laboratory-scale experiment, and they wouldn’t have liked it at my college.
However, I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually, and here is the beast.
And it really does have the same -- if you calculate, if you measure the vibrational frequencies, they are the same as S-H.
Space is just one aspect, so there’s no meaning to say absolutely where something is.
There’s only where it is relative to everything else that is.
And this network of relations is ever-evolving.
Why the limits to the movement?
Why is what has been achieved, or what the movement has done, been necessary but not sufficient to the crime?
I think there are a couple -- there are many reasons -- but a couple just to focus on briefly.
And the Holocaust culture that we have in this country makes Americans, sort of, more prone to, I think, want to bring Never Again to life.
The guilt that the Clinton administration expressed, that Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda, created a space in our society for a consensus that Rwanda was bad and wrong and we wish we had done more, and that is something that the movement has taken advantage of.
European governments, for the most part, haven't acknowledged responsibility, and there's nothing to kind of to push back and up against.
So this movement, if it's to be durable and global, will have to cross borders, and you will have to see other citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide, but actually making it such.
Governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude naturally or eagerly.
As we saw, they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports or reigning in loose nukes.
We lunge towards the extremes when we aren't operating and trying to, again, calibrate our relationship to the world around us.
Fourth and final point: he somehow, because he was working in all the world's worst places and all lesser evils, had a humility, of course, and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him.
I mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was.
Or if there was a hole I'd think like, oh damn, there was actually someone thought of that thought already.
Someone made that mistake already so I can't do it anymore.
I don't know where inspiration comes from.
I went to performing arts high school, where I was an actor.
And many of my friends were ballet dancers.
Again, I don't know where inspiration comes from.
IM: So by the way. Of all the most unboring things in the world, right.
I mean, like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that.
That is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring.
That is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring.
Actually, I read this great quote the other day, which was, "Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die."
Right? And then I realized, that was on my website, and then it said, like, you know, the quote was attributed to me and I thought, oh, I said something, you know, in an interview.

Right? And then I realized, that was on my website, and then it said, like, you know, the quote was attributed to me and I thought, oh, I said something, you know, in an interview.
I forgot that I said that. But it's really true.
IM: Excuse me, I didn't know. All right?
Chef: The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious.
IM: Yeah, it is, exactly.
And here we made 180 degrees change: we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house.
And that was done over a period of a couple of years, and now we are the leading organization, you know, exploring space on all of your behalf.
But even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves, sometimes there are setbacks.
Well, here we are four years later, and they're still working.
Now you say, Charles, you are really lying to us, and so on, but that's not true. We really believed they were going to last 90 days or 100 days, because they are solar powered, and Mars is a dusty planet, so we expected the dust would start accumulating on the surface, and after a while we wouldn't have enough power, you know, to keep them warm.
Well, I always say it's important that you are smart, but every once in a while it's good to be lucky.
Camera. We have a picture right now.
Yeah!
CE: That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this.
What is that?
CE: Not too bad.
So anyway, let me continue on showing you a little bit about the beauty of that planet.
EB: The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun.
RG: The temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
EB: The inside doesn't get very hot.
BC: We've lost 99 percent of our entry velocity.
So, we're 99 percent of the way to where we want to be.
But that last one percent, as it always seems to be, is the tricky part.
That's like taking two Empire State Buildings and stacking them on top of one another.
EB: That's when we separate from the back shell, and we're now in free-fall.
It's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen in a very short amount of time.
EB: That's when we separate from the back shell, and we're now in free-fall.
It's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen in a very short amount of time.
LC: So it's in a free-fall, but it's also trying to use all of its actuators to make sure that it's in the right position to land.
BC: Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes for a signal from Mars to get to Earth.
And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes.
So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started it'll already be over.
Then we get a little bit more serious, so we have what we call our CAD/CAMs and all the engineers who are involved, or scientists who are involved, who know about thermal properties, know about design, know about atmospheric interaction, parachutes, all of these things, which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent, so to see, does that meet the requirement that we need.
On the right, also, we have to take into account the environment of the planet where we are going.
If you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation, you know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor.

If you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation, you know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor.
We saw geysers coming out.
So this is a Yellowstone, you know, of Saturn.
We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet, which indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know, below the surface.
That was [unclear] also -- you know, because we were worried about the risk of it, but it worked pretty well.
We flew at the top of it, and we found that there is a fair amount of organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice.
And over the next few years, as we keep orbiting, you know, Saturn, we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface and make more accurate measurements.
Now, another satellite also attracted a lot of attention, and that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting, it's a satellite bigger than our moon, and it has an atmosphere.
And that atmosphere is very -- as dense as our own atmosphere.
So if you were on Titan, you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder, and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane.
I mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.
I am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland, and you have to go on talking like this all the time.
So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.
Yeah. And I think he looks now less miserable.
And it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closely at modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art is particularly topsy-turvy.
And I can show here a very good example.
And it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closely at modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art is particularly topsy-turvy.
And I can show here a very good example.
It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.
And yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.
And yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.
And this is my --  -- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.
That's a picture by Keith Haring.
I think it doesn't matter.
So, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.
One can see here quite clearly, you can see we have 25 pale green elements, of which one is in the form of a circle.
Or here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.
I mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all Mr. Haring's various works, in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.
For example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots.
You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee.
In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.
Yeah, from my own experience. So I'm --  Actually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad.
This is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.
But I think it could still benefit from more discipline.
By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.
But then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.
And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.
And when I returned it looked like this.
Yeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.
OK, I mean, I can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.
Yeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.
OK, I mean, I can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.
This is a picture by Rene Magritte, and I'd like you all to inwardly -- like in your head, that is -- to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.
But after a while, I just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans.
Or you could go into three-dimensional art.
Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.
I just piled them up.
So I'm -- yeah, actually I'm kind of finished at that moment.
And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.
Alexander Rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps. And it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking about, what does deep time do to a building?
Well, this is what deep time does to a building.
This is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old, and look what happened to it.

Well, this is what deep time does to a building.
This is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old, and look what happened to it.
It's right on the eastern border of Nevada.
It's the highest range in the state -- over 13,000 feet.
And you'll notice that on the left, on the left, on the west, it's very steep, and on the right it's gentle.
Those white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone.
That's a 2,000-foot thick formation, and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock.
It would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is.
Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem.
He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work.
It's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure.
Based on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed, so that a peal of 10 bells makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years.
The Hillis algorithm. 10 factorial gives you that number.
And in fact, pretty soon we'll hear the sound.
They're the world's oldest living thing.
People think they're just the size of shrubs, but that's not actually true.
There are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living.
So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain, some of them go back 10,000 years.
The stone itself is absolutely beautiful, sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there.
We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona join us on the expedition.
Edmund Schulman in the 1950s had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline, and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine called, "Longevity under Adversity in Conifers."
And then, based on that principle, he started looking around at the various trees at Timberline, and realized that the bristlecone pines -- he found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old.
Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right.
Because the owner said, "There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain."
And we said, "Wow, that's great. Listen, we'll counter. How about zero?
And we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction.
And we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction.
All you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars."
Well, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth, and by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay, we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars.

This is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it.
It's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten, a little bit of tungsten, left over, that's the kind of mine it was.
But there are many wonders back in there, like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers.
OK, here's another mine that's up on top of the property, and it dates back to 1870.
That's what the property was originally built around -- it was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine.
You may recognize a couple of the miners there.
There's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena, which is the lead-silver thing. They didn't find any.
They both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine.
It's this beautiful world all of its own, surrounded by cliffs, and it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom, until you get to this barrier, and it actually presents a problem.
So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach.
Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain.
And from where you're standing at 6,000 feet in the valley, it's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet.
And you can carry right on up through meadows and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet, where there's a bit of a problem.
Now, Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition, "Make the clock inaccessible.
This is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range.
And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end, you'll see what the valley used to look like.
This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years.
And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley, because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on, and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition, and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park,
and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell.
OK, let's take one more look at the mountain itself.
OK, let's take one more look at the mountain itself.
The clock experience should be profound, but from the outside it should be invisible.
Now, at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave.
In 2006 alone, almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria.
Now, try to imagine 40, 50 films wrapped, distributed, every week in the streets of Lagos, Nigeria and West Africa.
Some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars.
Now, try to imagine 40, 50 films wrapped, distributed, every week in the streets of Lagos, Nigeria and West Africa.
Some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars.
It has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs.
And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa, a wonderful, talented film director who is with us tonight.
The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood, of this incredible film industry, following Bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of corruption, called "Checkpoint."
Police corruption.
We didn’t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers.
They understood it, they embraced the technology and they run with it, and they’re successful.
I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways.
I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways.
I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology, look at the Nigerian model, make their films, create jobs, create a narrative for the population, something to identify, something positive, something that really is psychological relief and it's part of the culture.
But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us.
And so one of the questions that I asked you is, when you look around, what do you see?
Well, you see this space that's created by designers and by the work of people, but what you actually see is a lot of material that was already here, being reshaped in a certain form.
And so the question is: how did that material get here?
So the question should come to your mind is, what kind of design, you know, what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that?
And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated.
We're going to try and follow it up.
And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated.
We're going to try and follow it up.
We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study, and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine, in a certain sense.
There's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way, and around that are the Hubble -- you know, nearby kind of galaxies, and there's a sphere that marks the different times.
And behind that are some more modern galaxies.
You see the whole big picture?
And that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe.
And what we saw was, we saw these variations, and then they told us the secrets, both about the structure of space-time, and about the contents of the universe, and about how the universe started in its original motions.
So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture, and I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.
So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture, and I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.
And we go through a period of accelerating expansion, and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent, then to the Dark Ages, and then the first stars turn on, and they evolve into galaxies, and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies.
And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming.
What kind of evidence do we have for that?
So let me show you some of nature's patterns that are the result of this.
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space, and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean.
That is matter that doesn't interact with light the typical way that ordinary matter does, the way the light's shining on me or on the stage.
It's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it, we're going to make it white. OK?
So the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter.
Now we're going to zoom back out, and you can see this structure that, when we get very far out, looks very regular, but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations.
So they're simple building blocks.
There's a very simple fluid to begin with.
So here's that same end result.
You see a filament, you see the light is the invisible matter, and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up.
And we're going to fly around, and we'll fly around, and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect, and you get a large cluster of galaxies.
We need, you know, 30 days on 1,000 processors to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before.
So we have an idea of how to play seriously, creating the universe by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material, and we create everything we can see in any direction, right, from almost nothing -- that is, something extremely tiny, extremely small -- and it is almost perfect, except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in 100,000 level, which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see,
that is, galaxies and stars and so forth.
We organized into cities. We had many people.
And to keep the many from tyrannizing the one, we came up with concepts like individual liberty.
And then, to have to deal with large groups, say, at the nation-state level, and we had to have mutual non-aggression, or through a series of conflicts, we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace.
And this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital.
We saw genome sequences.
You can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the Internet if you want to, and clearly someone recently -- I saw in a science magazine -- they said, well, the 1918 flu is too dangerous to FedEx around.

Now, just imagine what that $100 computer will be in 2020 as a tool for education.
I think the challenge for us is -- I'm very certain that that will happen, the challenge is, will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net to let us take advantage of that device?
I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers, but we don't have very good software for them.
They conduct heat along their length but not across -- well, there is no width, but not in the other direction if you stack them up; that's a property of carbon fiber also.
If you put particles in them, and they go shooting out the tip -- they're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns.
The inside of the nanotubes is so small -- the smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers -- that it's basically a quantum world.
New materials that can make water, new materials that can make fuel cells work better, new materials that catalyze chemical reactions, that cut pollution and so on.
Ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol.
New ways of making electric transportation.
And John Doerr and Brook and others got concerned, [unclear], and we started looking around at what the world was doing about being prepared for a pandemic. And we saw a lot of gaps.
And so we asked ourselves, you know, can we find innovative things that will go fill these gaps? And Brooks told me in a break here, he said he's found so much stuff he can't sleep, because there's so many great technologies out there, we're essentially buried. And we need them, you know.
We have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling that still works, roughly. That's Tamiflu.
And the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of 1,000 in deaths and certainly enormous economic impact.
So we're very excited because we think we can fund 10, or speed up 10 projects and see them come to market in the next couple years that will address this.
So if we can address, use technology, help address education, help address the environment, help address the pandemic, does that solve the larger problem that I was talking about in the Wired article? And I'm afraid the answer is really no, because you can't solve a problem with the management of technology with more technology.
Markets are a very strong force.
For example, rather than trying to regulate away problems, which probably won't work, if we could price into the cost of doing business, the cost of catastrophe, so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe would have to take insurance against that risk.
So if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on.
And finally, I think we have to do something that's not really -- it's almost unacceptable to say this -- which, we have to begin to design the future.
We can't pick the future, but we can steer the future.
Our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes.

Foie gras and the future of cooking.
There's not a food today that's more maligned than foie gras, right?
I mean, it's crucified.
I mean, it's crucified.
It was outlawed in Chicago for a while.
It's pending here in California, and just recently in New York.
I'm not saying that there's not a rationale for being opposed to foie gras.
The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding.
Basically you take a goose or a duck and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat.
Suffice to say it's like -- it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming.
The problem for us chefs is that it's so freakin' delicious.
I mean, I love the stuff.
And fence line was amazing in itself.
The fence -- like this conception of fence that we have it's totally backward with him.
The electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside.
Or they were.
But he found this wild plant called the Lupin bush.
The Lupin bush, it's all around Extremadura.
Great creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom, make education seem like a bright idea.
Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation, or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so.
Great creativity can make politicians electable, or parties unelectable.
Great creativity can make politicians electable, or parties unelectable.
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce.
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips.
Science is clever, but great creativity is something less knowable, more magical. And now we need that magic.
This is a time of need.
Our climate is changing quickly, too quickly.
It’s already flattening out.
By 2050, it’s going to be a column and will start to invert.
This is why it’s happening.
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea.
As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer’s disease, well, it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease.
You should also keep your blood pressure down, because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.
These are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan.
Nobody knows how old the oldest living Coast Redwoods are because nobody has ever drilled into any of them to count their annual growth rings, and, in any case, the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow.
But it's believed that the oldest living Redwoods are perhaps 2,500 years old -- roughly the age of the Parthenon -- although it's also suspected that there may be individual trees that are older than that.
Think about this tree, rising upward into Redwood space, 325 feet, 32 stories, an individual living organism articulating its forms upward into space over long periods of time.
The Redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time: not human time, but what we might call Redwood time.
Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time.
Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time.
To us, when we look at a Redwood tree, it seems to be motionless and still, and yet Redwoods are constantly in motion, moving upward into space, articulating themselves and filling Redwood space over Redwood time, over thousands of years.
Plant this small seed, wait 2,000 years, and you get this: the Lost Monarch.
This buttress is less than halfway up the tree.
And then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods.
This particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base and extends upward for 150 feet.
There are four humans in this shot -- one, two, three, four.
And there's also something that I want to show you.
This is a flying buttress.
They're finding out that Redwoods can move moisture out of the air and down into their trunks, possibly all the way into their root systems.
They also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself.
If a portion of a Redwood is rotting, the Redwood will send roots into its own form and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart.
And we had -- we zoned it, you know: we put a nightclub, we put a disco where you could dance, and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to, and we had another place that was like a boardwalk, kind of a Coney Island.
And we laid out the zoning, but of course, people could build all around it however they wanted to.
And what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept, basically, was instantly and thoroughly ignored, and like, two months into the whole thing, -- which is really a small amount of time, even in Second Life time -- I remember the users, the people who were then using Second Life, the residents came to me and said, we want to buy the disco --
You know, an example of something -- pregnancy.
You can have a baby in Second Life.
This is done entirely using, kind of, the tools that are built into Second Life, so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby, of course -- Second Life is, at the platform level, at the level of the company -- at Linden Lab -- Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever.
So of course, we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or, you know, taking two avatars and merging them, or something.
But people built the ability to have babies and care for babies as a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so -- I mean, that's a pretty fascinating example of, you know, what goes on in the overall economy.
And of course, the existence of an economy is another idea.

Obviously, I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here, but I think that as -- even a sober, you know, the most sober, disconnected thinker about this, looking at it from the side, has to conclude, based on the data, that with those kinds of economic forces at play, there is definitely going to be a sea change, and that change is going to be intensely disruptive
relative to our concept of our very lives and being, and our identities, as well.
I don't think we can get away from those changes.
And that's quite exciting.
The vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength in creating the hydrogen.
A lot of hydrogen's produced today in the world.
And talking about the ultimate swarm, about having all of the processors and all of the cars when they're sitting idle being part of a global grid for computing capability.
We find that premise quite exciting.
The automobile becomes, then, an appliance, not in a commodity sense, but an appliance, mobile power, mobile platform for information and computing and communication, as well as a form of transportation.
The growth of the auto industry will be capped by sustainability issues if we don't solve the problems.
And there's a simple principle of strategy that says: Do unto yourself before others do unto you.
If we can see this possible future, others can too.
And then, as the other axis kicks in, those actually blur into a volume.
And the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case.
But this piece is due out in May.
No running water, no electricity. A wonderful, wonderful guy.
And you can look at more pictures.
I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done of some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you.

This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow.
It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world, and still played in the Southern mountains.
Now, the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this.
They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up.

It was hard on the cats, but it made a great little instrument.
Now, my brother and I had never heard anything like that in our whole lives. It was so beautiful.
We sat there all day picking cotton, without complaining, without crying, while they sang things like: "Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you moan" and "Wade in the water," and "I done done," "This little light of mine."
Finally, by the end of the day, we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton.
And pretty much never did.
But I also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day, and that was an eye-opener.
And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier.
Good news: Chariot's coming.
Good news: Chariot's coming.
And I don't want it to leave me behind.
It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the 1920s, before they had electric guitars, trying to make a loud guitar.
And then African-American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck, just like that -- a nice Merlot works very well.
That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect.
So we looked in that -- this was a commercial chemistry set.
It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see: sulfur, potassium nitrate and charcoal.
Man, we were only 10, but we knew that made gunpowder.
He and his buddies, they were older, and they were pretty mean.
They said they were going to beat us up if we didn't make some gunpowder for them.
We said, well, what are you going to do with it?
It just flared up, and he turned around, and he looked like this.
No hair, no eyelashes, no nothing.
There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet; the air was the just full of black smoke.
No hair, no eyelashes, no nothing.
There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet; the air was the just full of black smoke.
She came home, she took that chemistry set away, and we never saw it again.
She came home, she took that chemistry set away, and we never saw it again.
But we thought of it often, because every time she'd cook tuna surprise it made -- tasted faintly of gunpowder.
So I like to invent things too, and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back.
In my shop where I studied, or learned, there was a traditional hierarchy of master, journeyman and learned worker, and apprentice, and I worked as the apprentice.
The work as an apprentice was very primitive.
That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand.

We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.

We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.
After that, it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in, kind of, a mangle.
And that is, make meadows and not lawns.
And I think we have lost our connection, and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment.
I've had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while, and it is terribly engaging.
I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale, and I think we're encouraged to do that.
But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here, because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational.
That it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there.
This is the Library of Human Imagination.
The room itself is three stories tall.
In the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imagination that are computer controlled.
In the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imagination that are computer controlled.
The room is a theatre. It changes colors.
And all throughout the library are different objects, different spaces.
And it’s rare, because we never really get to see a brain.
We get to see a skull. But there it is.
All of imagination -- everything that we think, we feel, we sense -- comes through the human brain.
Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall, and happened upon this hidden cache of wines -- apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson. 1787, 1784.
He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles, he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building.
The mystery persisted for about 20 years.
It may come from Wagyu cattle, but it's not from the original, Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan.
There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe, and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, Cut, in Los Angeles.
I went there, and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars.
And it arrived, and it was tiny.
And I was outraged.
It was like, 160 dollars for this?
It was like, 160 dollars for this?
And then I took a bite, and I wished that it was tinier, because Kobe beef is so rich.
It's like foie gras -- it's not even like steak.

He uses tiny bottles, the glass is tinted, he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas.
And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it, he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online, so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing, and, you know, gauge its freshness.
I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.

The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet.
It's a cat that lives in trees, and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations.
And apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know, hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries.
It was three days, four meals.
And at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47.
And you know, it had this fragrant softness, and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil.
We all make decisions every day; we want to know what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.
And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times, that would be a tremendous gift.
It turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738 by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.
But the simple English translation -- much less precise, but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this: The expected value of any of our actions -- that is, the goodness that we can count on getting -- is the product of two simple things: the odds that this action will allow us to gain something, and the value of that gain to us.
In a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is, if we can estimate and multiply these two things, we will always know precisely how we should behave.
Now, this simple equation, even for those of you who don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.
Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars, but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me, most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars,
that multiplies to five, and that's more than I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.

For example, this is, of course, one of the most delicious tricks in marketing, is to say something used to be higher, and suddenly it seems like a very good deal.
When people are asked about these two different jobs: a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K, a job where you're getting a salary cut each year, and one in which you're getting a salary increase, people like the second job better than the first, despite the fact they're all told they make much less money. Why?
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period. Here's another nice example.

When you arrive at the theater, you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.
Well, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks, what's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience.
Nonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience.
You've all experienced this yourself, even if you've never come into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question: You want to buy a car stereo.
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars, but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.
So would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars?
Most people say they would.
These are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play, the kind of coverage, that they do.
Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they'll be hurt in these various ways, and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.
CA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying that our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?

CA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying that our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?
Talk more about it.
If Australia disappears tomorrow, terror is probably the right response.
That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand, when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed, more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country.
Is terror the right response?

Is terror the right response?
CA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event -- that it's so spectacular?
Second, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again.
People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason -- as if there's good reason, but sometimes people think there are.
So there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media, who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can.
I think in the case of terrorism, it isn't.
And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today -- how many people do you know got up and said, Poverty! I can't believe what poverty is doing to us.
People get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty.
That isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others.
CA: Last question.
Aubrey de Grey: My name's Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge.

I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills -- I work on aging -- and I'm interested in doing something about it, as we'll all hear tomorrow.
We've written a number of things on the role of Gaia hypothesis -- whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity in any meaningful scientific sense, and then, as an outgrowth of that, I worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war.
So, wonderful things and grim things.
But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet with external eyes, not just as our home.
Certainly, in the last 15 years, we've seen increasing numbers of planets outside of our solar system being confirmed, and just last month, a couple of weeks ago, a planet in the size-class of Earth has actually been found.
And so this is very exciting news.
So, my first bold prediction is that, is that in the universe, life is going to be everywhere.

So, my first bold prediction is that, is that in the universe, life is going to be everywhere.
So, with all of these things put together, I think that the chances of life are much greater than I would've ever thought.
I think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars, sometime in its past, is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half.
So this is a very bold statement.
So the game's afoot, and this is the game that we play in astro-biology.

Because if it's big and obvious, we would've already found it -- it would've already bitten us on the foot, and it hasn't.
How do you know it when you find it?
Because if it's big and obvious, we would've already found it -- it would've already bitten us on the foot, and it hasn't.
So, we know that it's probably quite cryptic.

And also, even perhaps more critically, because this is the only home planet we have, how do we protect us from it, while we study it?

And also, even perhaps more critically, because this is the only home planet we have, how do we protect us from it, while we study it?
So why might it be hard to find?
Well, it's probably microscopic, and it's never easy to study microscopic things, although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater depth, at much smaller scales than ever before.
Is it virus-sized? Is it smaller than that?
Is it bigger than the biggest bacterium? We don't know.
And speed of activity, which is something that we face in our work with sub-surface organisms, because they grow very, very slowly.
These extreme physical and chemical parameters make the biology that grows in these places very special.
Because contrary to what you might think, this is not devoid of life.
This is one of the richest caves that we have found on the planet, anywhere.
And the local Zoque Indians harvest this twice a year, as part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration.
This is very unusual for caves.
In some of the other amazing caves that we work in -- this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad, and this is one of the most famous caves in the world.
So, we're talking about things like inflatable liners that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave, foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology, various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies.
And the future is there for us to use these lava-tube caves on Mars.
And right now we're in caves, and we're doing science and recreation, but I think in the future we'll be using them for habitat and science on these other bodies.
Now, my view of what the current status of potential life on Mars is that it's probably been on the planet, maybe one in two chances.
The question as to whether there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth has now been very muddied, because we now know, from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth, that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets.
One of the burning questions, of course, is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface, as I fully expect that we will, is that a second genesis of life?

Do you need to be alive? I mean, that's a spooky thought, right?
Inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves.
It's real. In fact, I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of, if not one of the most, perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature.
It's real. In fact, I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of, if not one of the most, perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature.
It extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos.
It's a deep tendency toward order in nature that opposes what we've all been taught about entropy.
This is from a BBC show called "Predators," and what we're looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense.
When you're small and vulnerable, like these starlings, or like the fish, it helps to swarm to avoid predators, to confuse predators.
Let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous.
For a long time it was not believed when the first Western travelers, like Sir Francis Drake, went to Thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle.
No one believed them.
We don't see anything like this in Europe or in the West.
No one believed them.
We don't see anything like this in Europe or in the West.
And for a long time, even after it was documented, it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion.
This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles.
I have some metronomes here.
Can you hear that?
Can you hear that?
All right, so, I've got a metronome, and it's the world's smallest metronome, the -- well, I shouldn't advertise.
Anyway, so this is the world's smallest metronome.
So they built the blade of light, and it's a very thin ribbon of steel, the world's -- probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is, with cables that are out on the side.
You're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top.
These cables were on the side of the bridge, like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames -- that's what's holding up this bridge.
On opening day, thousands of Londoners came out, and something happened.
And within two days the bridge was closed to the public.
So I want to first show you some interviews with people who were on the bridge on opening day, who will describe what happened.
Interviewer: Right. So it was quite small -- Engineer: Yes. Interviewer: -- but real?
Engineer: Absolutely. Interviewer: You thought, "Oh, bother."
Engineer: I felt I was disappointed about it.
But how could the crowd become synchronized?
Was there something special about the Millennium Bridge that caused this effect?
This was to be the focus of the investigation.
Interviewer: Well, at last the simulated bridge is finished, and I can make it wobble.
Now, Allan, this is all your fault, isn't it? Allan McRobie: Yes.
Interviewer: You designed this, yes, this simulated bridge, and this, you reckon, mimics the action of the real bridge?
They're all having some difficulty walking.
And the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step.
But then, of course, everyone is driving the bridge.
It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working, not the Minister of Education, because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off, in which the people who had been causing, if you will, 40 years' worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived.
And suddenly, the kids have connected laptops.
They've leapfrogged.
The Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant called Yenching Palace in Washington, DC, which unfortunately is closed now, and about to be turned into Walgreen's.
And the house where John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok and Roll, on H Street in Washington.
And it's not completely gratuitous, because "wok" and "roll" -- Chinese food and Japanese foods, so it kind of works out.
I love this dish.
The original name of my book was "The Long March of General Tso."
And he has marched very far indeed, because he is sweet, he is fried, and he is chicken -- all things that Americans love.
Another dish, one of my favorites: beef with broccoli.
Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable; in fact, it is originally an Italian vegetable.
It was introduced into the United States in the 1800s, but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s.
And I found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives who are still in the town.
This guy is now five generations removed from the General; this guy is about seven.
I showed them the pictures of General Tso Chicken, and they were like, "We don't know this dish. Is this Chinese food?"
For example, there is French Chinese food, where they serve salt and pepper frog legs.
There is Italian Chinese food, where they don't have fortune cookies, so they serve fried gelato.
My neighbor, Alessandra, was shocked when I told her, "Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."

And this logo!
So me, General Tso's Chicken and this logo are all karmicly related.
But that dish also took about 10 years to spread across America from a restaurant in New York City.
You know, they get a real bad rap in the world.
People think they're sort of lowbrows.
One day, somebody suggested I read this book.

It was called -- it was called "The Air Pump," or something like "The Leviathan and The Air Pump."
And a vacuum -- there's nothing in a vacuum, so you've -- God couldn't be in there.
So therefore the church said that you can't make a vacuum, you know.
And Boyle said, bullshit.
But that's not my job. I'm not into that.
I do that on the weekend. And like -- what I'm trying to do is figure out what happens when you suck everything out of a compartment.
And he did all these cute little experiments.
And, I mean, that was my sort of goal.
I wanted it to go out of sight and then I wanted this little parachute to come back with the frog in it.
And -- I -- I -- I got this book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where there's a missile base.

They send it out for amateur rocketeers, and it said in there do not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar.
You know, that's what you call a lead.
You know, they made drugs to give the pilots if they were broken up in the process.
They made all kinds of -- and then finally one giant bomb to end the whole thing, right?
And everybody stepped back a little and said, you know, we ought to invest in this shit, because whoever has got the most of these people working in the places is going to have a dominant position, at least in the military, and probably in all kind of economic ways.
There is nothing in their contract, in fact, that makes it to their advantage always, to tell you the truth.
And the people I'm talking about are people that like -- they say that they're a member of the committee called, say, the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change.
And they -- and they have these big meetings where they try to figure out how we're going to -- how we're going to continually prove that the planet is getting warmer, when that's actually contrary to most people's sensations.
And so he came up with this theory, and he said, this will be cool, because it'll be a longer growing season in Sweden, you know, and the surfers liked it, the surfers thought, that's a cool idea, because it's pretty cold in the ocean sometimes, and -- but a lot of other people later on started thinking it would be bad, you know.
But nobody actually demonstrated it, right?
I mean, the temperature as measured -- and you can find this on our wonderful Internet, you just go and look for all NASAs records, and all the Weather Bureau's records, and you'll look at it yourself, and you'll see, the temperature has just -- the nighttime temperature measured on the surface of the planet has gone up a tiny little bit.

So if you just average that and the daytime temperature, it looks like it went up about .7 degrees in this century.
But in fact, it was just coming up -- it was the nighttime; the daytime temperatures didn't go up.
"Evidence for Large Decadal Variability in the Tropical Mean Radiative Energy Budget."
Excuse me. Those papers were published by NASA, and some scientists at Columbia, and Viliki and a whole bunch of people, Princeton.
And those two papers came out in Science Magazine, February the first, and these -- the conclusion in both of these papers, and in also the Science editor's, like, descriptions of these papers, for, you know, for the quickie, is that our theories about global warming are completely wrong. I mean, what these guys were doing, and this is what -- the NASA people have been saying this for a long time.

I mean, what these guys were doing, and this is what -- the NASA people have been saying this for a long time.
They say, if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere, it isn't going up -- it's not going up at all. We've doing it very carefully now for 20 years, from satellites, and it isn't going up.
And in this paper, they show something much more striking, and that was that they did what they call a radiation -- and I'm not going to go into the details of it, actually it's quite complicated, but it isn't as complicated as they might make you think it is by the words they use in those papers. If you really get down to it, they say, the sun puts out a certain amount of energy --
But if we did, in 2025 or something, have double the CO2 as we had in 1900, they say it would be increase the energy budget by about -- in other words, one watt per square centimeter more would be coming in than going out.
So the planet should get warmer.
Well, they found out in this study -- these two studies by two different teams -- that five and a half watts per square meter had been coming in from 1998, 1999, and the place didn't get warmer.
But what I'm saying is, you can be delighted, because the editor of Science, who is no dummy, and both of these fairly professional -- really professional teams, have really come to the same conclusion and in the bottom lines in their papers they have to say, what this means is, that what we've been thinking, was the global circulation model that we predict that the earth is going to get overheated
that it's all wrong. It's wrong by a large factor.
It's not by a small one. They just -- they just misinterpreted the fact that the earth -- there's obviously some mechanisms going on that nobody knew about, because the heat's coming in and it isn't getting warmer.

You'd buy that thing, you'd bring it home, you'd plug it in, and it would do absolutely nothing at all.
And, you see, this era coincided with my own childhood.
I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.
Who of you grew up in a family business, suffered the torture? Yes, yes.

And when I was making icons, I was, like, the icon master, and I was, like, yeah, I'm really good at this, you know.
And then luckily, you know, I had the fortune of going to something called a library, and in the library I came upon this very book.

They're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard.
It's put inside the computer.
And that little program's on that cardboard disk.
How do you take that time you have left and go after it?
So, Naomi was pivotal in that.
And so, I began to think more carefully about the computer.
People say, Are you going to bring RISD into the future?
And I say, well, I'm going to bring the future back to RISD.
There's my perspective. Because in reality, the problem isn't how to make the world more technological.

Really interesting questions. I think a lot of it has to do with body size.
In fact, I think that most of it has to do with body size -- the size you are when you inherit a vacant ecospace from whatever natural disaster.
Looking at dinosaur evolution and studying it, digging it up for many years, I end up looking at the mammal radiation, and it seems as though everything is quick time, just like technology, advancing by an order of magnitude.

Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace, an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it.
There's burrowing birds.
They inhabit the trees at all body sizes, and, of course, they inhabit the land.
So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature.
228 million years old, we found what really is the most primitive dinosaur: that's the Ur-dinosaur.
A three-and-a-half foot thing, beautiful skull, predator, meat-eater, a two-legged animal.
So, all the other dinosaurs that you know, or your kids know, at least, on four legs.
So, all the other dinosaurs that you know, or your kids know, at least, on four legs.
This is sort of a look at the skull, and it's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long.
It looks rather bird-like because it is.
Here's some others.
This is something we found in Morocco, an immense animal.
We prototyped by CAT-scanning the brain out of this animal.
It turns out to have a forebrain one-fifteenth the size of a human.
This was the cover of Science, because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals, but we can see by some in our administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the attitudes remain the same. Anyway, smaller raptors.
All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of -- all those small animals -- they all come from northern continents.
Man 2: You have the back legs? No, you have the front legs, my friend.
I've got it. I've got the back legs.
Somebody get the front legs.
But when they were divided, indeed they were divided, and we do see the continents carving differences among dinosaurs.
But there's one thing that's even more important, and I think that's extinction.
We have downgraded this factor.
And so the next -- over the next six decades, believe it or not, I've built a number of aircraft, with the goal of creating something that could do for you, or me, what the hummingbird does, and give you that flexibility.
I've called this vehicle, generically, a volantor, after the Latin word "volant," meaning, to fly in a light, nimble manner.
Volantor-like helicopter, perhaps.
Now I would argue, actually, if you look at the fact that on the highways today, you're only averaging about 30 miles per hour -- on average, according to the DOT -- the Skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour, up to 25,000 feet.
And so, in effect, you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the ability to get around as far as speed is concerned.
Unbeknownst to many of you, the highway in the sky that I'm talking about here has been under construction for 10 years.
This is the world -- there won't be you as a pilot. And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that -- and I've had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there, flying around and experiencing that.
And of course, I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that.
But the vehicle itself is going to be a very, very controlled environment.
A vertical-takeoff aircraft, like the hummingbird, has a very high metabolism, which means it requires a lot of energy.
Getting that energy is very, very difficult. It all comes down to that power plant -- how to get a large amount of power in a small package.
Fortunately, Dr. Felix Wankel invented the rotary engine.
Getting that energy is very, very difficult. It all comes down to that power plant -- how to get a large amount of power in a small package.
Fortunately, Dr. Felix Wankel invented the rotary engine.
A very unique engine -- it's round, it's small, it's vibration-free.
Redundancy is the critical issue here.
If you want to stay alive you've got to have backups.
And we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine, and continued to hover.
What I thought I would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that's tracked by architecture.
What's interesting about architects is, we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature, and arguably, beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature.
So, for roughly 300 years, the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture, because the nose was one-fifth of your head, or because your head was one-seventh of your body.
In all these examples, there's one ideal form, because these are thought in terms of structure.
And as an architect, I've always found these kinds of systems very limiting, because I'm not interested in ideal forms and I'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment.
So, what I thought I would bring up is another component that needs to be thought of, whenever you think about nature, and that's basically the invention of generic form in genetic evolution.
My hero is actually not Darwin; it's a guy named William Bateson, father of Greg Bateson, who was here for a long time in Monterey.
And he was what you'd call a teratologist: he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations to find rules and laws, rather than looking at the norms.
So, instead of trying to find the ideal type or the ideal average, he'd always look for the exception. So, in this example, which is an example of what's called Bateson's Rule, he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb.

When I first saw this image, 10 years ago, I actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time.
Now, as an architect, part-to-whole relationships is all I think about, but in terms of product design it's becoming more and more of an issue for companies.
So, the first kind of test product we did was with Alessi, which was for a coffee and tea set.
It's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set; we knew that at the beginning. So, I actually went to some people I knew down south in San Diego, and we used an exploded titanium forming method that's used in the aerospace industry.
A couple of years into the process, I spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around, looking for design.
And I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam: I was there going into the design stores, and mixing with our crowd of designers, and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also.
We know a lot about what's going on with design around the world, and it's getting increasingly more difficult to find design that reflects a unique culture.
And since that time in Amsterdam, I spent an increasing amount of time in the cities, looking at design for common evidence of design that really isn't under so much of a designer's signature.
I was in Buenos Aires very recently, and I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava.
He's a Spanish architect and designer.

He's a Spanish architect and designer.
And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge -- I love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally -- and it was a bit of a disappointment, because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use.
And I recognized that oftentimes design, when you're set up to see design, it can be a bit of a letdown.
Some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games; I go and see design relationships.
Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture, and the way that the trees form vertical elements.
Red is a color in the landscape that is often on stop signs.
In Italy, you know, almost everything, kind of, looks good.
Simple menus put on a board, achieving, kind of, the sort of balance.
But I'm convinced that it's because you're walking around the streets and seeing things.
Now, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff, but this was an actual moment when I got off my bike, and I looked and I thought, it's as if all of my biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement.
And it reminded me that -- to keep in the present, to look out for these kinds of things.
It gave me possibilities for wonder -- if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree, and create some installations.
And I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements.
I was at the art show in Miami in December, and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art, and amazed at the prices of art and how expensive it is, but having a great time looking at it.
And I came outside, and the valets for this car service had created, you know, quite a nice little collage of these car keys, and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that I had seen in Tokyo.
I work on the mayor's council in San Francisco, on the International Design Council for Mayors, and Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle, and I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there.
I thought that I should include at least one shot of technology for you guys.
This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago, where the Spanish artist-designer Plensa has created, kind of, a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people in this area.



Same thing: he understood the shape of the future, even though it was something that would only be implemented by people much later.
Or Paul Baran, and his vision for packet switching.
Hardly anybody listened to him in his day.
We finally, after 40 years of knowing that wholegrain was a healthier option, we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them.
The challenge, though, for a wholegrain baker is, you know, how do you make it taste good?
Because whole grain -- it's easy with white flour to make a good-tasting bread. White flour is sweet.
I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules.
And -- and you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once, but they won't eat it again if they don't like it, right?
So, this is the challenge for this bread.
I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules.
And -- and you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once, but they won't eat it again if they don't like it, right?
So, this is the challenge for this bread.
But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other, they create a stronger molecule, a stronger protein we call gluten.
And so we, in the mixing process, have to develop the gluten, we have to activate the leaven or the yeast, and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly.
Then we get into fermentation, the third stage, which is really where the flavor develops.
Then we get into fermentation, the third stage, which is really where the flavor develops.
The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars, creating carbon dioxide and alcohol -- essentially it's burping and sweating, which is what bread is.
It's yeast burps and sweat.
It's yeast burps and sweat.
And somehow, this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food, and we're going to explore that in a minute.
But then, quickly through the next few stages.

And somehow, this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food, and we're going to explore that in a minute.
But then, quickly through the next few stages.
The final fermentation takes place in stage nine.
We call it "proofing."
Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive.
It's just a euphemism for killing, right?
I mean, that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig, you know?
Yes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life.
I mean, that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig, you know?
Yes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life.
We harvest the wheat, and in harvesting it, we kill it.
I mean, that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig, you know?
Yes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life.
We harvest the wheat, and in harvesting it, we kill it.
And we save some of those for the next generation.
But most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour.
And at that point, the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity.
But most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour.
And at that point, the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity.
It's not only been killed, but it's been denied any potential for creating future life.
I'd call that radical.
So, we've got now this flour.
And what do we do? We add some water.
So, we've got now this flour.
And what do we do? We add some water.
In stage one, we weigh it.
Leaven comes from the root word that means enliven -- to vivify, to bring to life.
By the way, what's the Hebrew word for clay? Adam.
You see, the baker, in this moment, has become, in a sense, sort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well, while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive.

You see, the baker, in this moment, has become, in a sense, sort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well, while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive.
And we know it's alive because in stage three, it grows. Growth is the proof of life.
And we know it's alive because in stage three, it grows. Growth is the proof of life.
And while it's growing, all these literal transformations are taking place.
Enzymes are breaking forth sugars.
And the baker's choices all along the way determine the outcome of the product.
A subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time -- it's all about a balancing act between time, temperature and ingredients. That's the art of baking.
So all these things are determined by the baker, and the bread goes through some stages, and characters develop.
And then we divide it, and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units, and each of those units are given shape by the baker.
And as they're shaped, they're raised again, all along proving that they're alive, and developing character.
And at stage 10, we take it to the oven.
And at stage 10, we take it to the oven.
It's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough -- a few people do, I think, but not too many.
I've met some dough eaters, but -- it's not the staff of life, right? Bread is the staff of life.
But dough is what we're working with, and we take that dough to the oven, and it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of 140 degrees, it passes what we call the "thermal death point."
Students love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game.
But it's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there.
But it's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there.
The yeast, whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough, to enliven it, to vivify it, in order to complete its mission, which is also to turn this dough into bread, has to give up its life.
So you see the symbolism at work? It's starting to come forth a little bit, you know.
And it's what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life.
This is the product that everyone in the world eats, that is so difficult to give up.
It's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life.
And what we're going to attempt to do with this bread here, again, is to use, in addition to everything we talked about, this bread we're going to call "spent grain bread" because, as you know, bread-making is very similar to beer-making.
Beer is basically liquid bread, or bread is solid beer.
And --  they -- they're invented around the same time. I think beer came first.
So now we not only have a high-fiber bread, but now fiber on top of fiber.
And so this is, again, hopefully not only a healthy bread, but a bread that you will enjoy.
So, if I, kind of, break this bread, maybe we can share this now a little bit here.
They say, we Dutch, we like real, natural, authentic experiences.
So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response, which is: I point out that first of all, you have to understand that there is no such thing as an inauthentic experience.
Why? Because the experience happens inside of us.
Right? It's beans; right? It's coffee beans.
You know how much coffee is worth, when treated as a commodity as a bean?
Two or three cents per cup -- that's what coffee is worth.
Right? It's beans; right? It's coffee beans.

Everything's gotten simpler in design, and here's this mega airport, and God, I just -- I took a picture.
I thought, God, that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport.
Till a couple months later, I went back to the same airport -- same plane, I think -- and looked up, and it said C.
Yet it doesn't say that; it doesn't need to say that.
I would probably park in front of the other one.
I'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so.
It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive.
But I was in Milan and saw this street sign, and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist.
And this graffiti artist has come along, made this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.
So, this is from "2nd Sight," a book I did on intuition.
I think it's not the only ingredient in design, but possibly the most important.
It's something everybody has.
I think it's not the only ingredient in design, but possibly the most important.
It's something everybody has.
It's not a matter of teaching it; in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can't quantify it: it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design, but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter.
And it's -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before, and basically, I've interpreted the different quotes.
So, this was the contents page originally.
When I got done it was 540 pages, and then the publisher, Gingko Press, ended up cutting it down considerably: it's just under 400 pages now.

When I got done it was 540 pages, and then the publisher, Gingko Press, ended up cutting it down considerably: it's just under 400 pages now.
But I decided I liked this contents page -- I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it.
And also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal, and it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.
And I thought, you know, what were they thinking?
You'd think maybe cement, possibly, or something.
But anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD, and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape, and it's ready. I think I'm ready. So.
This is an experiment, really, for a client, Quicksilver, where we were taking what was a six-shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web.
So, this is a six-shot sequence.
And then as the agency explained to me, they said, "Look, we don't have little green people in our country; why would we put little green people in our ads, for instance?"
So, I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it; I think it's a very small-minded approach, the world is certainly much more global, and I certainly think the people of Germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer, though we'll never know.
This is some work from Ray Gun.
There's a lot of great writing in "Ray Gun."
And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books.
Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article -- so I set the whole article in Dingbat.

Look at the image of this lady -- who knows what she's going through? -- and the copy says: "He knows just how to give me goosebumps."
Yeah, he jumps out of buildings. It's -- unfortunately, this one works, kind of, as a spread.
And this continued through the entire magazine.

What's happening in genomics, and how this revolution is about to change everything we know about the world, life, ourselves, and how we think about them.
If you saw 2001: A Space Odyssey, and you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith, you know, that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species.
There is a historical archive.
Living in your genome is the history of our species, and you as an individual human being, where you're from, going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years, and that's now starting to be understood.
But also, the genome is really the instruction manual.
All those side effects, you know, oily residue and, you know, whatever they say in those commercials: forget about that.
They're going to make all that stuff go away.
What does a genome look like?
They have discovered pathways that create flavors, although it's very important to understand that those compounds that it's cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome, in our tongue, for us to understand and interpret those flavors.
They've also discovered that there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well.
They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease.
They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease.
They now are understanding, and the work is going on, exactly how this plant works, and we have the capability to know, to read that entire code and understand how it ticks.
So, then what do you do?
I've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe.
Well, you know, we really, we argue and debate about it -- we say it's climate, it's soil, it's this. Well, guess what?
We can figure out what the heck terroir is.

So, I want to start out with this beautiful picture from my childhood.
I love the science fiction movies.
Because this was a slide that was passed between the two major intelligences on Earth -- a Mac to a PC -- and it can't even get the letters right --  -- so how are we going to talk to the aliens?
And if they're 50 light years away, and we call them up, and you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then 50 years later it comes back and they say, Please repeat?
I mean, there we are.
But there's two fates to everything, isn't there?
Now, a lot of you are going to die of old age, but some of you, horribly enough, are going to die in an accident.
And that's the fate of a planet, too.
They hate we animals.
They really want their world back.
And they've tried over and over and over again.
And they've tried over and over and over again.
This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti-Gaian.
This whole Gaia idea, that life makes the world better for itself -- anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory? No.
This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti-Gaian.
This whole Gaia idea, that life makes the world better for itself -- anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory? No.
So, I really suspect there's an alternative, and that life does actually try to do itself in -- not consciously, but just because it does.
Six hours later, up goes the temperature.
Now, the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide in this solid graph, and look what happens to its temperature.
Its temperature drops.
If you've got reflux oesophagitis, there are 15 procedures, and Joe Schmo does it one way and Will Blow does it another way, and none of them work, and that's the way it is with this word, hope.
They all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen.
And you know what I found out?
They all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen.
And you know what I found out?
The Indo-European root of the word hope is a stem, K-E-U -- we would spell it K-E-U; it's pronounced koy -- and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from.
So, here's what it is: I'll repeat it.
"The world will not be saved by the Internet."
It's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by?
So, if we are to be the world's healer, every disadvantaged person in this world -- including in the United States -- becomes our patient.
Every disadvantaged nation, and perhaps our own nation, becomes our patient.
So, it's fun to think about the etymology of the word "patient."
I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true: I went in in 1956, came out in 1959, was working at the University of Washington, and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article, for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm.
Now, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs -- any of the cool stuff we've got now.
And it was an arm that, instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record, went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm.
Sound, light: I'm going to draw the analogy.
When Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this.
Hasn't changed that much.
When Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this.
Hasn't changed that much.
Light came out of it in every direction.
Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused.
Now, think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb, but you couldn't focus light; if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to.
That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are.
A hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket.
Now, they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed, because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound.
And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made.
ATMs that talk to you; nobody else hears it.
Sit in bed, two in the morning, watch TV; your spouse, or someone, is next to you, asleep; doesn't hear it, doesn't wake up.
We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles.

I have been really lucky with this technology: all of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.
They have literally beat a path to our door.

We've been selling it since about last September, October, and it's been immensely gratifying.
And the sound that you're hearing, unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face, is made out in front of it, in the air.
The air is not linear, as we've always been taught.
You turn up the volume just a little bit -- I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels -- and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.
The air is not linear, as we've always been taught.
You turn up the volume just a little bit -- I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels -- and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.
Here's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow.
Here's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow.
It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure.
Now, imagine, if you will, without getting too technical, I'm making a little sine wave here in the air.
Well, if I turn up the amplitude too much, I'm having an effect on the pressure, which means during the making of that sine wave, the speed at which it is propagating is shifting.
All of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear.
Linearity means higher quality sound.
Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite: it's 100 percent based on non-linearity.
An effect happens in the air, it's a corrupting effect of the sound -- the ultrasound in this case -- that's emitted, but it's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect.
Now, the question is, where's the sound made?
An effect happens in the air, it's a corrupting effect of the sound -- the ultrasound in this case -- that's emitted, but it's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect.
Now, the question is, where's the sound made?
Instead of being made on the face of the cone, it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air, and so when I aim it towards you, what you hear is made right next to your ears.
I said we can shorten the column, we can spread it out to cover the couch.
I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker, the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound.
When you listen to stereo on your home system, your both ears hear both speakers.
When you listen to stereo on your home system, your both ears hear both speakers.
Turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear.
So, the stage is more restricted -- the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you.

Sheryl Shade: Hi, Aimee. Aimee Mullins: Hi.
SS: Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit, and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete.
It was really, really hot.
And it's the first -- I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio, and I didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock -- it actually acted like a lubricant and I'd be, kind of, pistoning in the socket.
And at about 85 meters of my 100 meters sprint, in all my glory, I came out of my leg.
All this training -- I had transformed my life.
I became a collegiate athlete, you know. I became an Olympic athlete.
And it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there.
AM: I got to pick my height, exactly.
Patrick Ewing, who played for Georgetown in the '80s, comes back every summer.
And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with foot injuries.
I may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on.
SS: She can't really stand on these legs. She has to be moving, so ...
AM: Yeah, I definitely have to be moving, and balance is a little bit of an art in them.
Day zero: nothing happening.
They're healthy; they're clean -- it's amazing.
Actually, we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you're walking around healthy.
We made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it.
Why not? Every plant virus, every insect virus, every marine virus.
Everything that we could get out of GenBank -- that is, the national repository of sequences.
We put it on the chip; what do we see? Well, we saw parainfluenza-4.
Well, what the hell's parainfluenza-4?
No one tests for parainfluenza-4. No one cares about it.
In fact, it's not even really sequenced that much.
There's just a little bit of it sequenced.
There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it.
Clearly, we have a case of a healthy person that's going down.
OK, that's one case report.
I'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes that's unpublished -- it's going to come out tomorrow -- and it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip to find something new and open a new door.
First of all, I'll tell you that a little automated prediction told us it was very similar to a mouse virus.
But that doesn't tell us too much, so we actually clone the whole thing.
And the viral genome I'm showing you right here?

And the viral genome I'm showing you right here?
It's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new; no one's ever seen it before.
Its closest relative is, in fact, from mice, and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus, because it's infecting a species other than mice.
And this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses.
We've done it for many patients now, and we can say that they're all independent infections.
They all have the same virus, but they're different enough that there's reason to believe that they've been independently acquired.
And he said, "Well, I'm in Truro," which is where I was, and he asked me out for supper.
That's it.   Then — Will I keep going?   Then we dated for two years, broke up for 10, got back together and got married.   DL: So anyway, we're running out of time, so I'll just get to it.
I'm going to play a piece of music for you.
It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen.
I starts out with a slow air.
Airs were played in Europe at burials, as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site, the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player.
DL: How fast?
NM: Not too fast.
DL: We're going to play a tune and Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano.

The Cape Breton piano playing is just awesome. It's very rhythmic and, you'll see it.
The Cape Breton piano playing is just awesome. It's very rhythmic and, you'll see it.
My mom plays piano, and she learned to play before they had a piano at home in Cape Breton. Before Mom's family had a piano in Cape Breton, she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board, and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter's evenings and Mom would be banging on this board, so when they bought a piano, they bought it in Toronto and had it taken
by train and brought in on a horse, a horse and sleigh to the house.

And it really needed to get much lower than that to be cost effective.
I studied all the new things that had happened in solar cells, and was trying to look for ways we could innovate and make solar cells more inexpensively.
There are a lot of new things that are happening to do that, but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy.
There are a lot of new things that are happening to do that, but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy.
Some people even say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life.
Hopefully, if we can reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells, that will become more practical.
So we tried to come up with a way of making a non-tracking collector, a collector that would gather much more than one degree of light, with no moving parts.
So we created this genetic algorithm to try this out, we made a model in XL of a multi-surface reflector, and an amazing thing evolved, literally evolved, from trying a billion cycles, a billion different attempts, with a fitness function that defined how can you collect the most light, from the most angles, over a day, from the sun.
And this is the shape that evolved.
Now that we have concentrated sunlight, what are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity?
So we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity, or heat to electricity.
And one of the great ones of all time, James Watt's steam engine of 1788 was a major, major breakthrough.

This engine, because it was so interesting -- it only worked on air, no steam -- has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the Stirling engine principle.
But after the Stirling engine, Otto came along, and also, he didn't invent the internal combustion engine, he just refined it.
He showed it in Paris in 1867, and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up.
You could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space, and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile applications.
So, once you have mobility, now you're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units, as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you're not making as many units, so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn't benefit.
What about if I put a thermal sponge in the middle, in the passageway between where the air has to move between hot and cold?
So he made fine wires, and cracked glass, and all different kinds of materials to be a heat sponge.
So when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end, it puts some heat into the sponge.
The mechanism to control each petal is below there with a microprocessor on each one.
There are thermocouples on the engine -- little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them.
Each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it.
We have an inverter in there, so you get 117 volts A.C.
and you also get hot water.
The hot water's optional.
So, we've been working on this for the last two years.
We're very excited about the progress, we do have a very long way to go though still, and let me tell you a little bit more about that.
This is how we envision it would be in a residential installation: you'd probably have more than one unit on your roof.
But, everywhere around us we have insatiable use for energy because it's so cheap.
And it's cheap because we've been subsidized by energy that's been concentrated by the sun.
Basically, oil is solar energy concentrate.
And only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to.
So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand.
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.
Why? Well there's only a few diseases that account for the vast majority of those deaths: diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.
So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning, which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?
Well, what's the history of this disease?
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.
So it was absolutely gigantic.
And the disease was all over the world.
The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.
And so that's why the death rate did come down.
Now, ironically, what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones, which is where the rich countries are.
And so that's why the death rate did come down.
Now, ironically, what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones, which is where the rich countries are.
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.
1945, it's still most places.
1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.
1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.
And rich men are afflicted.
And so that's why that priority has been set.
But, malaria -- even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact.
And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the U.S. at the forefront.
Now, the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis, but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.
Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.
And we've done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replicate it, to raise the average capability -- or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.
You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?"
The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.
And I thought it was so fantastic.
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.
Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there doesn't seem to be an argument there.
On another subject --  -- I was driving in the country one day with my wife, and I saw this sign, and I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design."
And she said, "What are you talking about?"
And here's just a series of experiments where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square?
Now, this is a little illusion.
That poster is not folded.
That poster is not folded.
It's not folded, that's a photograph and it's cut on the diagonal.
Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.
It's not folded, that's a photograph and it's cut on the diagonal.
Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.
And here, a very peculiar poster because, simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer, it won't sit still in the space.
Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.
And here, a very peculiar poster because, simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer, it won't sit still in the space.
At times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front, and then it shifts.
And another piece for the art directors' club is "Anna Rees" casting long shadows.
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it, and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and I didn't want to be embarrassed, so I worked very hard on this.
But then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever."
And as soon as I said that, I discovered that the word "hat" was hidden in the word "whatever," and that led me to the inevitable conclusion.
But then again, it's on my list of didactic posters.
If you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing, it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it.
Right?
Well, not always.
I don't know how many of you remember this: another moral hero, 15 years ago, Aaron Feuerstein, who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts -- they made Polartec -- The factory burned down.
3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll.
Why? Because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go.
In many ways, it's what TED is all about.
Wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons.
This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention.
Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.
So they engineered these cells so that when they're growing in the exponential phase, they would smell like wintergreen.
And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.
Twenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams.
They started competing.
The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine that makes red wine good for you into beer.
But now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering, let me show you what's happened in that period of time.
Two years ago, you saw this creature.
An almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico called an axolotl that can re-generate its limbs.
Two years ago, you saw this creature.
An almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico called an axolotl that can re-generate its limbs.
You can freeze half its heart. It regrows.
And I'm living proof.
Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea.
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system."
How much?
Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent.
You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect?
Would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there inspire us to find ways to survive our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence?
Might it be the discovery of a distant civilization and our common cosmic origins that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans?
Whether we're born in San Francisco, or Sudan, or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy, we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust.
The 21st century now allows us to build bigger glasses -- much bigger glasses.
In Northern California, we're beginning to take observations with the first 42 telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array -- and I've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold and all the TeamSETI members in the TED community who have so generously supported this research.
The ATA is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes, and hooked together with computers.
Today, our signal detection algorithms can find very simple artifacts and noise.
If you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager 1 spacecraft, the most distant human object in the universe, 106 times as far away from us as the sun is.
And over those long distances, its signal is very faint when it reaches us.
I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years.
And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization.
So I want to show you a clip of the film now.
You know, this is some tough stuff.
So we started to have early team meetings, and we got everybody together, and it was really more like therapy in the beginning, convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this.
We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.
Being from the visual effects industry, we, with David, believed that we now had enough time, enough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money.
And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence.
So, when you're faced with something like that, of course you've got to break it down.
Now, you can buy certified organic produce.
But no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish.
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations.
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations.
The throwaway society cannot be contained -- it has gone global.
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.
Narrator : The levels are increasing, the amount of packaging is increasing, the "throwaway" concept of living is proliferating, and it's showing up in the ocean.
Anchor: He offers no hope of cleaning it up.
Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.

I had to focus all my energies towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral reefs.
Now, when you think of a coral reef, this is what most people think of: all these big, hard, elaborate corals and lots of bright, colorful fishes and things.
But, this is really just the tip of the iceberg.
The deeper you go, the loopier you get.
You don't want to drive drunk, you don't want to dive drunk, so that's a real big problem.
And of course, the third problem is the one I found out the hard way in Palau, which is the bends.
You don't want to drive drunk, you don't want to dive drunk, so that's a real big problem.
And of course, the third problem is the one I found out the hard way in Palau, which is the bends.
Now the one thing that I forgot to mention, is that to obviate the problem of the nitrogen narcosis -- all of those blue dots in our body -- you remove the nitrogen and you replace it with helium.
There had to be a better way.
And, indeed, there is a better way.
In 1994, I was fortunate enough to get access to these prototype closed-circuit rebreathers.
Well, in order to really understand how they do that you have to take off the hood, and look underneath and see what's going on.
There are three basic systems to a closed- circuit rebreather.
The most fundamental of these is called the breathing loop.
It's just pure mechanics, allowing you to cycle air through this breathing loop.
And, the other component on a breathing loop is the carbon dioxide absorbent canister.
Now, as we breathe, we produce carbon dioxide, and that carbon dioxide needs to be scrubbed out of the system.
It's really a very interesting -- you ever see "The Abyss" where Ed Harris, you know, he's sinking down along the side of the wall?
That's kind of what it feels like. It's pretty amazing.
Also, when you get down there, you find that the water is very, very clear.
This is the second extraordinary photograph I'm going to show you.
This one was taken at the exact moment I was down there filming those sharks.
This was taken exactly 300 feet above my head.
I was pre-med at the time, and I thought I would become a surgeon because I was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.
At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.
I started to realize that I could look at the whole city as a living organism.
But they happened to be wild dogs living there, and it was right by the water, so there were swans and ducks swimming around and trees growing everywhere and bees nesting in the sugar barrels.
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.
And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature.
I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams as if I went back in time and became a child again.
This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct, which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.
The construction began in 1837.
I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.
Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home, you're actually feeling the hand-laid bricks and shimmying up and down narrow cracks and getting wet and muddy and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.
This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.
The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city, but is now a sanctuary for outcasts, who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life.
This is underneath my alma mater, Columbia University.
The tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the Manhattan Project.
This particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum, which was demolished in 1890 when Columbia moved in.
This is the New York City Farm Colony, which was a poorhouse in Staten Island from the 1890s to the 1930s.
Most of my photos are set in places that have been abandoned for decades, but this is an exception.
One of the things we realized was how important Twitter could be during real-time events.
When the wildfires broke out in San Diego, in October of 2007, people turned to Twitter to report what was happening and to find information from neighbors about what was happening around them.
But it wasn't just individuals.
In this case, this guy's not liking what he's hearing.
The President himself is our most popular Twitter user, although his tweets have dropped off as of late, while Senator McCain's have picked up.
As have this guy's.
As have this guy's.
Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium: you send one message and it goes out to everybody, and you receive the messages you're interested in.
One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message.
This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system.
Another is via the API.
We built an application-programming interface, which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter.
We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software that can send Twitter updates -- interfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry -- as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks or a plant Twitter when it needs water.
Probably the most important third-party development came from a little company in Virginia called Summize.
Summize built a Twitter search engine.
And they tapped into the fact that, if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they're doing and what's around them, you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it's going on.
This really changed how we perceived Twitter.
For instance, here's what people are saying about TED.
We liked this so much we actually bought the company and are folding it into the main product.
This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways, but it introduces new use cases as well.
One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta.
So David and I decided to go find out, through the best research we could muster, what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer, to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games.
We spent two and a half years conducting research; we spent another year and a half in advance development.
Then we formed a spin-off company.
You also know how much labor is needed.
If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil, on a clay soil, on a steep slope, on flat soil, you put those different recipes; if you combine them, out of that comes a business plan, comes a work plan, and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have, and you can do it.
This is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of.
This is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of.
It exudes [unclear]-like compounds from the roots.
The acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro-climate, to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses.
And after eight years they might actually yield some timber -- that is, if you can preserve it in the right way, which we can do with bamboo peels.
It's an old temple-building technique from Japan but bamboo is very fire-susceptible.
So if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of losing everything again.
We lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year; they lost 12 IQ points. It was a disaster for orangutans and people.
So these fires are really the first things to work on.
That was why I put it as a single point up there.
And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil, and we were actually monitoring, measuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares, 5,000 acres.
And this forest is quite different.
What I really did was I just followed nature, and nature doesn't know monocultures, but a natural forest is multilayered.
You measure how the trees grow back, but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back.
And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced, how many medicines can be kept here.
And finally I made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain.
All the seeds get eaten.
So now we do the monitoring on the inside -- from towers, satellites, ultralights.
Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back.
The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel, and they can build a house, they have some fuel wood to cook with.
And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like.
They have enough income for three families.
They have enough income for three families.
But whatever you do in that program, it has to be fully supported by the people, meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local, cultural values.
There is no simple one recipe for one place.
We know it's a lot, but we do not yet know the answers to how much, and by what processes, carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere, held in its biomass, and moving on through the ecosystem.
So I hope I've showed you that canopy-dwellers are not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy that Tarzan and Jane were interested in, but rather that they foster biodiversity contribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles, and they also help to keep our global climate stable.
Up in the canopy, if you were sitting next to me and you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems, you would also see scenes like this.
The final project I'll talk about is one that's very close to my heart, and it involves an economic and social value that is associated with epiphytic plants.
In the Pacific Northwest, there's a whole industry of moss-harvesting from old-growth forests.
These mosses are taken from the forest; they're used by the floriculture industry, by florists, to make arrangements and make hanging baskets.


The "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado, called Craig.
The "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado, called Craig.
It's only a couple dozen square miles. It's in the Rockies.
And the job in question was sheep rancher.
Melanie is the wife of Albert.
Albert is the shepherd in question.
Melanie picks up the lamb -- two hands -- one hand on both legs on the right, likewise on the left.
Being an apprentice, you know, you do that.
Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife.
And I'm like that's not rubber at all, you know.
And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies, it was very -- it was, it was impressive.
In the space of about two seconds, Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail, right next to the butt of the lamb, and very quickly the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding.
A second later, with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger, he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.
A second later, with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger, he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.
And he pulled it toward him, like so, and he took the knife and he put it on the tip.
Now you think you know what's coming, Michael -- you don't, OK?
We're on twice a day on the Discovery Channel -- we can't do this."
He says, "OK."
He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands.
Melanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post, band goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum.
Lamb goes on the ground, lamb takes two steps, falls down, gets up, shakes a little, takes another couple steps, falls down.
I'm like, this is not a good sign for this lamb, at all.
He's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking.
And I was just so blown away at how wrong I was, in that second.
And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time.
Albert hands me the knife.
I go in, tail comes off.
I go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off.
I go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off.
Albert instructs, "Push it way up there."
I do.
He didn't follow his passion.
He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way.
And I hear that story over and over.
Anyhow, a whole lot of things.
I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong.
But, what it all comes down to is this.
I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong.
But, what it all comes down to is this.
I formed a theory, and I'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds.
It goes like this -- we've declared war on work, as a society, all of us.
It's a civil war.
It's a cold war, really.
My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about, and "pretty," and "emotions."
The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun.
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.

The acid will ruin the gold plating.
So actually, I took a carton of orange juice and I poured it in the glass to take this picture.
Beneath it is a wonderful knife.
Beneath it is a wonderful knife.
It's a Global cutting knife made in Japan.
First of all, look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at.

And so it's got everything, right?

It's beautiful and it's functional.
Yeah! Yeah.
Or look at Google.
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design," you get 10 pages of results.
Now, the weird thing is Google lies, because if I type "design and emotion," it says, "You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway."
So, OK.
So I type "design emotion" and my website wasn't first again.
It said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults.
Buy it anyway.
It's so much fun to drive."
Buy it anyway.
It's so much fun to drive."
And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it, this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.
No problem.
Now I'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air -- and I'm not going to go near it, thank you.
Intense fear paralyzes you.
Intense fear paralyzes you.
It actually affects the way the brain works.
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk, and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.
It was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it -- some papers and scissors and stuff.
And she'd bring them in, and she'd say, "This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.
Would you tie those two strings together?"
And she'd bring them in, and she'd say, "This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.
Would you tie those two strings together?"
So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here and they couldn't reach the other string.
And it's beautiful -- it's in the Museum of Modern Art.
A water bottle: You buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water.
And when people are finished, they don't throw it away.
And it's beautiful -- it's in the Museum of Modern Art.

And when people are finished, they don't throw it away.
It's all about the visceral experience.
The middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that's actually where most of our stuff gets done.
Visceral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
Behavioral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
Almost everything we do is subconscious.
I'm walking around the stage -- I'm not attending to the control of my legs.
It will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours -- and not waste water, by the way, because it recirculates the same dirty water.
Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.
It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot.
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line.
There's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that.
And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.
There's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that.
And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.
And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing.
On top of that, it communicates, which is what emotion does.
Emotion is all about acting; emotion is really about acting.
It's being safe in the world.
Well, this has emotions if you like, because it signals the waiter that, "Hey, I'm finished. See -- upright."
And the waiter can come by and say, "Would you like more water?"
It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design.
So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take.
And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way, without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior.
And I'm here to unveil our latest effort, and most successful effort so far, which is still very much a work in process.
But the difference here is that you can use any surface, you can walk up to any surface, including your hand, if nothing else is available, and interact with this projected data.
The device is completely portable, and can be --   So, one important difference is that it's totally mobile.
Another even more important difference is that in mass production, this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging -- could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck.
He can ask for additional information.
So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria.
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice.
Actually, I have them on stage with me: grapevines, magnolias -- truly stunning.
Poetry matters.
Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art.
It's a conversation about augmentation.
It's a conversation about potential.
A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore.
And what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting-edge technology -- robotics, bionics -- with the age-old poetry, we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity.
I think that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity, we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have.
I think of Shakespeare's Shylock: "If you prick us, do we not bleed, and if you tickle us, do we not laugh?"
And this polar bear stands over the husky, no claws extended, no fangs taking a look.
And they begin an incredible ballet.
A play ballet.
Those of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment -- rare -- where the Red Sox won the World Series.
But take a look at the face and the body language of everybody in this fuzzy picture, and you can get a sense that they're all at play.
Imaginative play.
Imaginative play.
I love this picture because my daughter, who's now almost 40, is in this picture, but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination, her ability to spin yarns at this age -- preschool.
A really important part of being a player is imaginative solo play.
Well, this bushman, I think, is talking about the fish that got away that was that long, but it's a fundamental part of the play scene.
So what does play do for the brain?
Well, a lot.
So it's -- for me, its been an extremely nourishing scholarly adventure to look at the neuroscience that's associated with play, and to bring together people who in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way.
And that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about.
And this is one of the ways you can study play -- is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram.
I'm sorry I don't have a playful-looking subject, but it allows mobility, which has limited the actual study of play.
And we've got a mother-infant play scenario that we're hoping to complete underway at the moment.
The reason I put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does.
The reason I put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does.
The animal world has objectified it.
In the animal world, if you take rats, who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years and you suppress play -- they squeak, they wrestle, they pin each other, that's part of their play.
Now, Jane Goodall has here a play face along with one of her favorite chimps.
So part of the signaling system of play has to do with vocal, facial, body, gestural.
You know, you can tell -- and I think when we're getting into collective play, its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals.
So what I would encourage on an individual level to do, is to explore backwards as far as you can go to the most clear, joyful, playful image that you have, whether it's with a toy, on a birthday or on a vacation.
And begin to build to build from the emotion of that into how that connects with your life now.
And you'll find, you may change jobs -- which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this -- in order to be more empowered through their play.
Take the meeting off, and have peace of mind that you can come back to me.
Because when you need it again, the meeting is literally hanging in your closet.
The Wearable Meeting.

Because when you put it on, you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting.
The next step of evolution in mammals and creatures with divinely superfluous neurons will be to play.
And the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear or you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experience sets play aside as something separate.
And its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain.
It's actually almost 20 years ago when I wanted to reframe the way we use information, the way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web.
Now, 20 years on, at TED, I want to ask your help in a new reframing.
So going back to 1989, I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.
So going back to 1989, I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.
Nobody really did anything with it, pretty much.
But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens -- 18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side, as a sort of a play project, kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.
But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens -- 18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side, as a sort of a play project, kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.
And so he gave me the time to code it up.
So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like: hypertext protocol, HTTP; the idea of URLs, these names for things which started with HTTP.
The frustration was all this unlocked potential.
In fact, on all these discs there were documents.
So if you just imagined them all being part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky, say on the Internet, then life would be so much easier.
More or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it.
Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.
Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?
And Hans made a point of saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data."
And I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data."
So I want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did, but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data.
I could use it as a kid to do my homework.
So we're talking about making the place, making the world run better by making this data available.
In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data in a government department, often you find that these people, they're very tempted to keep it -- Hans calls it database hugging.
And it's not just America. It's all over the world.
And it's not just governments, of course -- it's enterprises as well.
So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.
In fact, I'll just go into one area -- if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example, drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos, because they had their genomics data in one database in one building, and they had their protein data in another.
Now, they are sticking it onto -- linked data -- and now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask, I wouldn't ask -- they would.
What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons?
You ask the linked data -- which they've now put together -- 32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at.
The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist -- questions which actually bridge across different disciplines -- is really a complete sea change.
It's very very important.
We need to do that with linked data.
One last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting.
Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.

I’m going around the world giving talks about Darwin, and usually what I’m talking about is Darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning.
Now that title, that phrase, comes from a critic, an early critic, and this is a passage that I just love, and would like to read for you.
You would have thought it stands to reason that design requires an intelligent designer.
But Darwin shows that it’s just false.
Today, though, I’m going to talk about Darwin’s other strange inversion, which is equally puzzling at first, but in some ways just as important.
And, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny.
This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why.
Let’s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector, because sugar is high energy, and it’s just been wired up to the preferer, to put it very crudely, and that’s why we like sugar.
There’s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey.
If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind, you wouldn’t see why they tasted sweet.
You have to look in our brains to understand why they’re sweet.
And if you spend a lot of time in hospital, you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities.
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.
Now, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point, and you must have wondered what's the right approach.
So that's what I did.
I was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients.
So originally I didn't have much money, so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice.
And from that point on I started thinking, are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision, or is it a more general case?
And it turns out it's a more general case -- there's a lot of mistakes we do.
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities, and I want to talk to you about cheating.
So, all this was about decreasing the fudge factor.
What about increasing the fudge factor?
The first experiment -- I walked around MIT and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators -- these were common refrigerators for the undergrads.
Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find, because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton.
See, while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody -- not even the actual Natural History Museum on the island of Mauritius -- has a skeleton that's made from the bones of a single dodo.
Well, this isn't exactly true.
Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand, I made some measurements of her thumb, and I scaled them out to the size of the skull.
I blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that, along with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be, exactly how long, etc.
And over a few hours, I eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I -- it's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality.
This is the "Kniphausen Hawk."
It is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around 1700 for a Swedish Count, and it is very likely the object from which Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon.
Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book.
I actually had done some research a few years before -- it's why the folder was there.
I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica, of the Maltese Falcon on eBay, and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference.
But I discovered, in researching further, really wanting precise reference, that one of the original lead birds had been sold at Christie's in 1994, and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original Christie's catalogue, and in it I found this magnificent picture, which included a size reference.

I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.
I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan, a New Jersey editor, actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in 1991, although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers' specifications, because there was a lot of controversy about it.

It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made.
You want to know how obsessed I am. This project's only for me, and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper, in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...
like it is in the movie.
Yeah, I know!
On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica I bought on eBay.
There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon, because I had to get it back out of the mold. There's my first casting, there's my master and there's my bronze.
There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things, which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin, you lose a little bit of volume, you lose a little bit of size.
Yeah, no, really, this was like aah -- why didn't I remember this?
Why didn't I start and make it bigger?
So what do I do? I figure I have two options.
And it carried 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark, and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the Normandie to fly it.
So the Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go.
This is auto-gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s.

This is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in 1940, when a Messerschmitt ME109 bursts into the House of Commons and buzzes around, just to piss off Churchill, who's down there somewhere.
It's a fond memory of times past.
Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit, just for the fun of it. This was a piece I did -- a brochure again -- "RMS Tyrannic: The Biggest Thing in All the World."
I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the Lampoon, and I did that, and I thought, "Well, I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it."
People wrote in for reprints of that thing.
Urban absurdism -- that's what the New Yorker really calls for.
I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years, and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with is how you actually define poverty. What does it mean?
So often, we look at dollar terms -- people making less than a dollar or two or three a day.
And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at income as only one variable.
You know, I found that volcano on Google Images, not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics.
Anyway, this all started a few years ago, when they started carrying your voice over the Internet rather than over a phone line, and we've come a long way since that.
But that was interesting in itself. This is companies like Vonage.

Basically you take an ordinary telephone, you plug it into this little box that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem.
I'm not plugging T-Mobile.
The New York Times has very rigid policies about that.
Ever since that Jayson Blair jerk ruined it for all of us.
They went around to these carriers and said, "Look at these cool features." And Verizon is like, "Hmm, no.
I don't think so."
It was not very conducive to innovation.
Please don't corner me at the party tonight and go, "What are you? An Apple fan boy?"

It's got bad things and good things. Lets all acknowledge that right now.
You have to go to YouTube and type in "iPhone Shuffle."
This guy did a mock video of one that's one inch square, like the real iPod Shuffle.
It's like, "It only has one button.

A song is running through your head -- you sing it into the thing: do do do do do, da da da da da da, da dum ...

This is Pandora. Free Internet radio. Not just free Internet radio -- you type in a band or a song name.
It will immediately play you that song or that band.

At this time, there were thousands of individuals, we think, that were infected with HIV.
So I have a couple of really important questions for you.
If this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point, why was it the case that it took us until 1984 to be able to discover this virus?
This is what it looks like now.
Early on, in order to ship our specimens, we had to have dry ice. To get dry ice we had to go to the breweries -- beg, borrow, steal to get these folks to give it to us.
Now we have our own liquid nitrogen.
Her whispering, "Thanks love." Lightly, lightly against me.
I think I'll lighten up a little.
Another, different kind of poem of youth and age.
This is a newer poem, a brand new poem.
The title is "This Happened."
A student, a young woman in a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee, perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes; a teacher passes and chides her, "Be careful, you might fall," almost banteringly chides her, "You might fall," and the young woman, 18, a girl really, though she wouldn't think that, as brilliant as she is, first in her class, and "Beautiful, too," she's often told,
Weightfully upon me was the world.
Weightfully this self which graced the world yet never wholly itself.
Weightfully this self which weighed upon me, the release from which is what I desire and what I achieve.
So it's enough to bury any industry.
So, should we rather ask, "Can anything save newspapers?"
There are several scenarios for the future newspaper.
Did design do this?
Design was just a part of the process.
And the process we made was not about changing the look, it was about improving the product completely.
Of course I can use this power for example for nice spinning -- we call it "helicopter moves."
From there I went on to wingsuit flying.
Wingsuit flying is a suit, that I can make fly, just only with my body.


I was asked by Wilsonart International, a plastic laminate company, which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world -- they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York, in 2000.
Each EOD team goes out on about 600 of these bomb calls every year, defusing about two bombs a day.
Perhaps the best sign of how valuable they are to the war effort, is that the Iraqi insurgents put a $50,000 bounty on the head of a single EOD soldier.
Unfortunately, this particular call would not end well.

Unfortunately, this particular call would not end well.
By the time the soldier advanced close enough to see the telltale wires of the bomb, it exploded in a wave of flame.
So the first is that the future of war, even a robotics one, is not going to be purely an American one.
The U.S. is currently ahead in military robotics right now, but we know that in technology there's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage.
In a quick show of hands, how many people in this room still use Wang Computers?  It's the same thing in war. The British and the French invented the tank.
Soldiers have a name for these clips.
They call it war porn.
The typical one that I was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a Predator strike taking out an enemy site. Missile hits, bodies burst into the air with the explosion.

A film also exists in time; it's an experience that you should go through emotionally.
And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen were all about learning something, or knowledge, or driven by talking heads, and driven by ideas.
And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions, and really to follow my journey.

I think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental, and perhaps not planned at all.
And those three clips will be followed by a scene of perhaps what, to me, is really his greatest building which is a building in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
He built the capital over there.
And I think you'll enjoy this building, it's never been seen -- it's been still photographed, but never photographed by a film crew.
We were the first film crew in there.
So you'll see images of this remarkable building.

So you'll see images of this remarkable building.
A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it, it was built entirely by hand, I think they got a crane the last year.
Unfortunately it took so long that Lou never saw it finished.
He died in 1974.
The building was finished in 1983.
Moshe Safdie: He was a real nomad.
And you know, when I knew him when I was in the office, he would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely, and he would pack up and go.
You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him.
I engage in the use of game theory, game theory is a branch of mathematics and that means, sorry, that even in the study of politics, math has come into the picture.
We can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics, we need to look at this in a rigorous way.
Now, what is game theory about?
We do need to know who has a stake in trying to shape the outcome of a decision.
We need to know what they say they want, not what they want in their heart of hearts, not what they think they can get, but what they say they want, because that is a strategically chosen position, and we can work backwards from that to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making.
We need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand.
They care about the outcome. They'd like an outcome as close to what they are interested in as possible.
They're careerists, they also care about getting credit -- there's ego involvement, they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome, or as important, if it's their druthers, to block an outcome.
And so we have to figure out how they balance those two things.
And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different way that bacteria live.
The clue to this came from another marine bacterium, and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri.
What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium, a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean, named Vibrio fischeri.
That's how bioluminescence works -- they're talking with these chemical words.
The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology.
Again, another plug for the animals in the ocean, Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid.

Again, another plug for the animals in the ocean, Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid.
What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid, and it's been turned on its back, and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells, they live in there, at high cell number that molecule is there, and they're making light.

The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light.
The way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii, just in sort of shallow knee-deep water.

The squid is nocturnal, so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps, but then at night it has to come out to hunt.
On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in, since it's just in those couple feet of water.
What the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria.

Then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back.
And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom -- which is made by the bacterium -- exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back, so the squid doesn't make a shadow.
And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom -- which is made by the bacterium -- exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back, so the squid doesn't make a shadow.
It actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter-illuminate itself in an anti-predation device so predators can't see its shadow, calculate its trajectory, and eat it.
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean.
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean.
But then if you think about it, the squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that.
And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep, it buries itself in the sand, and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm, and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria.

Now the bacteria are dilute, that little hormone molecule is gone, so they're not making light -- but of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand.
They all have a species-specific system -- they have a molecule that says "me."
But then, running in parallel to that is a second system that we've discovered, that's generic.
So, they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor, and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria.
It's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication.
What happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you.
They take that information inside, and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population.

They take that information inside, and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population.
Then again we turn to chemistry, and we figured out what this generic molecule is -- that was the pink ovals on my last slide, this is it.
And so they lock into those receptors, and they jam recognition of the real thing.
By targeting the red system, what we are able to do is to make species-specific, or disease-specific, anti-quorum sensing molecules.
We've also done the same thing with the pink system.
The hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria.
To finish I'll just show you the strategy.
In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule, but the logic is exactly the same.
To finish I'll just show you the strategy.
In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule, but the logic is exactly the same.
What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal, in this case, a mouse, it doesn't initiate virulence right away.
75 percent of Americans think Alaska is part of Canada.
But only two percent don't know the effect that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy --  seems a contradiction.
Or this ad that I read in the New York Times: "Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society.
And another is, non-oppositional strategies.
And this is instead of contradiction.
Where you deny the other person's reality, you have paradox where you allow more than one reality to coexist, I think there's another philosophical construction.
I still have a way to go.
And what I hope to do, when I make these connections, is short circuit people's thinking.
You know, make you not follow your usual train of association, but make you rewire.
This is the sound of one hand clapping.
So, as we lose the context of our identity, it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative, becomes the context in which we live.
The stories that we tell -- what we push out -- becomes who we are.
Here is the problem: at 147 dollars a barrel, which we were in six months ago, the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil.
Then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 -- sometimes it's 40, sometimes it's 50.
Now we're running a stimulus package.
And after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery, and the industrial revolution started within less than one year.
And the U.K. had 100 years of economic growth.
We have to make the right moral decision.
And this is very critical stuff.
If you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives, you just have to go to any major city.
This is not the stomping ground of our Pleistocene ancestors.

And it won't be done.
But when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world, which is going to be the case with these technologies, when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial, which is already the case, and when they're almost impossible to police, it's not a question of if this is going to happen, it's when and where and how it's going to happen.
Humanity is going to go down this path.
20 researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere, and be completely immersed in their data.
Imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin.
Imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material.
And our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration.
I'm going to fly you into five research projects in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin.
This first project is called the AlloBrain.
And that's what I want everyone in here to feel like, the Incredible Hulk, at the end of this presentation.
More specifically, I want you to feel like you're capable of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer, a world-class language learner, and a tango champion.
And I would like to share my art.
And then Chris Sacca, who is now a dear friend mine, had completed an Iron Man with 103 degree temperature, said, "I have the answer to your prayers."
And he introduced me to the work of a man named Terry Laughlin who is the founder of Total Immersion Swimming.
That set me on the road to examining biomechanics.
And now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming.
I'll be doing a swimming lesson later, for myself, if anyone wants to join me.
Last thing, breathing. A problem a lot of us have, certainly, when you're swimming.
One of the most elegant dancers of his generation, known for his long steps, and his tempo changes and his pivots.
Alicia, in her own right, very famous.
So I think you'll agree, they look quite good together.
Apply them to very big dreams.
And when I think of what I fear now, it's very simple.
When I imagine my life, what my life would have been like without the educational opportunities that I had, it makes me wonder.
You have to plan ahead to get to the top.
But you also can't forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete.
This is a climb called the Dike Route, on Pywjack Dome, up in the Yosemite high country.
I'm here today, as June said, to talk about a project that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years.
We're crocheting a coral reef.
And it's a project that we've actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world, who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project, in many of its different aspects.
And it's a project that we've actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world, who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project, in many of its different aspects.
It's a project that now reaches across three continents, and its roots go into the fields of mathematics, marine biology, feminine handicraft and environmental activism.
It's true.
Why on earth are you crocheting a reef?
Woolenness and wetness aren't exactly two concepts that go together.
Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble?
Woolenness and wetness aren't exactly two concepts that go together.

Cast it in bronze."
It's almost impossible to model this structure any other way, and it's almost impossible to do it on computers.
So what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody?
The next few minutes is, we're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug.
So what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody?
The next few minutes is, we're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug.
This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the 19th century.
And I have a point outside the line. How many straight lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line?
What do we mean to talk about a straight line on a curved surface?
Now mathematicians have answered that question.
Does anyone want to guess what it is?
Infinity. You all got it right. Exactly.
There is, there's a third alternative.
And this is actually the field of mathematics that underlies general relativity and is actually ultimately going to show us about the shape of the universe.
So there is this direct line between feminine handicraft, Euclid and general relativity.
Now, I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible.
Now, I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible.
Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate -- didn't know it was impossible to violate, and they're simply getting on with it.
They've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years.
Their answer was interesting.
They said, "Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs."
And that's true. But it also goes deeper than that.
And of course, in a way, when I say romance, I mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation.
I think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product.
The product was that airplane.
So I built model airplanes.
And I found that in doing the model airplanes the appearance drawings were not enough.
You couldn't transfer those to the model itself.
And I flew it.
And that's the way I work now.
When I started this chair it was not a preconceived notion.
I started with a lot of loose ideas, roughly eight or nine years ago.
And the loose ideas had something to do with what I knew happened with people in the office, at the work place -- people who worked, and used task seating, a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long.
And I felt, the one thing they don't need, is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there.
And the loose ideas had something to do with what I knew happened with people in the office, at the work place -- people who worked, and used task seating, a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long.
And I felt, the one thing they don't need, is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there.
So I took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn't have to fuss with it.
So my idea was that, instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls, that you would sit on the chair, and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline.
Now that may not mean a lot to some of you.
But you know most good chairs do recline because it's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing and better flow.
As I recline, my head says more or less vertical.
Well if you're reclined a great deal, you have to use muscle force to hold your head there.
So that's where a headrest comes in.
Now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it'll fit, you know, a tall guy and a short girl.
So here we are.
I've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place.
So here we are.
I've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place.
But then I knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with headrests that nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position.
We stole the idea from bicycle seats, and put gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb point load -- distributes the loading so you don't get hard spots.
You cant hit your elbow on bottom.
And I did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people.
Or in Arizona, which is John McCain's home, Obama didn't have much improvement.
But there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here.
This kind of Arkansas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, West Virginia region.
So it's the combination of these two things: it's education and the type of neighbors that you have, which we'll talk about more in a moment.
And the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they're both very rural, and they are educationally impoverished.
So yes, racism is predictable.
You see people without neighbors who are African-American who were much more likely to say, "That would give me a problem."
So it's really not even about urban versus rural.
It's about who you live with.
I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise.
But the point is, this is all good news, because when something is predictable, it is what I call designable.
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem, even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism.
We took what we knew about Africa, the default device, the mobile phone, as our common denominator, and went from there.
We got reports like this.
This is just a couple of them from January 17th, last year.
We got reports like this.
This is just a couple of them from January 17th, last year.
And our system was rudimentary. It was very basic.
But today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic.
The click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life, announcing our entry into every lightless room.
The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature.

It's why they leave lights on around the house.  Adults find it comforting.
It means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries; we made the world more cooperative.
Transportation walls came tumbling down.
You know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods.
And it will be some months beforeward, and we see a long steady progression of the evolution from the first wiggles, to rolling over, and sitting up, and crawling, standing, walking, before we get to that magical point in which we can motate in the world.
And yet, when we look forward in the brain we see really remarkable advance.
By this age the brain can actually store.
It has stored, recorded, can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands, tens of thousands of objects, actions, and their relationships in the world.
And those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands, potentially millions of ways.
By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities.
And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills.
This brain is very much a thinking machine.
And by this age there is absolutely no question that this brain, it has a person on board.
And that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form its basic processing machinery.
This is actually a period of dramatic change in which it doesn't take learning, per se, to drive the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain.
All it takes for example in the sound domain, is exposure to sound.
All it takes for example in the sound domain, is exposure to sound.
And the brain actually is at the mercy of the sound environment in which it is reared.
So for example I can rear an animal in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound, a repertoire of sound that I make up, that I make, just by exposure, artificially important to the animal and its young brain.
The input doesn't really have to be meaningful.
I don't have to be in a behavioral context.
This is required so the brain sets up it's processing so that it can act differentially, so that it can act selectively, so that the creature that wears it, that carries it, can begin to operate on it in a selective way.
I don't have to be in a behavioral context.
This is required so the brain sets up it's processing so that it can act differentially, so that it can act selectively, so that the creature that wears it, that carries it, can begin to operate on it in a selective way.
In the next great epoch of life, which applies for most of life, the brain is actually refining its machinery as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities.
It is the basis of our real differentiation, one individual from another.
You can look down in the brain of an animal that's engaged in a specific skill, and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels.
So here is a very simple experiment.
It's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained in a task that involves it manipulating a tool that's equivalent in its difficulty to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon.
The monkey actually mastered the task in about 700 practice tries.
So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all.
Those tries were elaborate.
Each attempt was substantially different from the other.
But the monkey gradually developed a strategy.
Billions of events have occurred in your history that are related in time to yourself as the receiver, or yourself as the actor, yourself as the thinker, yourself as the mover.
Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body that are always associated with you as the receiver, and that result in the embodiment of you.
You are constructed, your self is constructed from these billions of events.
Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body that are always associated with you as the receiver, and that result in the embodiment of you.
You are constructed, your self is constructed from these billions of events.
It's constructed. It's created in your brain.
Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled.
It's degraded.
The child's native language is such a case is not English.
It's muffled English. It's degraded Japanese.
It's crap.
And the brain specializes for it.
It creates a representation of language crap.
And then the child is stuck with it.
Now the crap doesn't just happen in the ear.
And then the child is stuck with it.
Now the crap doesn't just happen in the ear.
It can also happen in the brain.
They are about an order of magnitude longer, about 11 times longer in duration on average, than in a normal child.
Space constants are about three times greater.
Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain.
They are about an order of magnitude longer, about 11 times longer in duration on average, than in a normal child.
Space constants are about three times greater.
Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain.
And you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology.
Then these children increasingly in evaluation after evaluation, in their operations in language, and their operations in reading -- we document that abnormal neurology.
The point is is that you can train the brain out of this.
Noise is increasing in the brain.
And learning modulation and control is deteriorating.
And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which, for example, the brain is representing language again.
Your issues as it relates to this science, is how to maintain your own high-functioning learning machine.
And of course, a well-ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it, is key.
But also in your future is brain aerobics.
She said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls.
I am lesbian."
So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas, but I told my daughter that this is one exception --  -- that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.
In the bird outbreaks we now can see that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus except the Americas.
And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment.
In domestic birds, especially chickens, it's 100 percent lethal.
In domestic birds, especially chickens, it's 100 percent lethal.
It's one of the most lethal things we've seen in circulation in the world in any recent centuries.
And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens, and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers with the result that there's cover-up.
It mimics what we now understand about reconstructing the 1918 flu virus, the last great pandemic, in that it also jumped directly from birds to people.
We had evolution over time, and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings: 55 percent of people who have become infected with H5N1 have, in fact, succumbed.
And we don't have a huge number of people who got infected and never developed disease.
And you'll have massive competition.
Now we did purchase a vaccine, you've probably all heard about it, made by Sanofi-Aventis.
Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H5N1.
And Tamiflu. You've probably heard of this drug, made by Hoffmann-La Roche, patented drug.
There is some indication that it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak.
Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time, well, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.
LG: Um yeah. So we don't actually know what the lethality was of the 1918 strain to wild birds before it jumped from birds to humans.
It's curious that there is no evidence of mass die-offs of chickens or household birds across America before the human pandemic happened.
That may be because those events were occurring on the other side of the world where nobody was paying attention.
And we see the evolution of Alpha through time.
We see it start. And we see it grow up to the stable state the wars around the world look like.
And it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah until the Samarra bombings in the Iraqi elections of '06.
And it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah until the Samarra bombings in the Iraqi elections of '06.
And the system gets perturbed. It moves upwards to a fragmented state.
This is when the surge happens.
The opposite happened.
The groups became stronger.
They became more robust.
They became more robust.
And so I'm thinking, right, great, it's going to keep going down.
We can talk to them. We can get a solution. The opposite happened.
The aluminum is because it's very light.
The bronze is nice hard, durable material that could roll on the ground.
Inside of the bronze ball there's a lead weight that is free-swinging on an axle that's on two bearings that pass in between, across it, like this, that counterbalance this weight.

Inside of the bronze ball there's a lead weight that is free-swinging on an axle that's on two bearings that pass in between, across it, like this, that counterbalance this weight.
So it allows it to roll.
And the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction.
But if you put something on top of it, it disbalances it. And so it would tip over.
But in this case because the interior is free-swinging in relation to the sphere, it can stand up on one point.

I was exploring, really early on, wanting to make things float in the air.
And I thought up a lot of ideas.
This is sculpture that I made that -- it's magnetically levitated.
But it's uh -- let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit without, um -- oops.
So this is just floating, floating on a permanent magnetic field, which stabilizes it in all directions.
Except there is a slight tether here, which keeps it from going over the top of its field.

It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave.
And then the Moon in the center, and it's floating. And this is in France.
This is in Sapporo.
It's balancing on a shaft and a ball, right at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity, which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty.
This is in Sapporo.
It's balancing on a shaft and a ball, right at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity, which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty.

I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment to do a feasibility study, and they analyzed it, and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it.
So we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen.
This is the control room inside of the ship.
This is the control room inside of the ship.
The idea of this air genie is, it's something that can just transform and become anything.
It's like a traveling show.

It's like a traveling show.
It has speakers on it. And it has cameras over the surface of it.
So it can see its environment, and then it can mimic its environment and disappear.
Here the legs are retracting.
The cabin is open or closed, as you like.
Primarily I would be interested in how it would interact with, say, going to a college campus, and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences, the world, the situation of the globe.
The default image on the object would probably be a high-resolution Earth image.
But then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations -- all of the things that we're concerned with today.

But then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations -- all of the things that we're concerned with today.
And then at night the idea is that it would be used as kind of a rave situation, where the people could cut loose, and the music and the lights, and everything.
Or this could represent a college green.
And then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this.
And so interacting with the same kind of imagery.

And I think few of us spend the day without eating bread in some form.
Unless you're on one of these Californian low-carb diets, bread is standard.
Bread is not only standard in the Western diet.
But we have, somehow, in the course of the last few centuries, or even decades, started to cultivate an image of a mythical, rural agricultural past.
It was only 200 years ago that we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution.
And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here, it's very important to understand what that revolution did to us.
It was only 200 years ago that we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution.
And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here, it's very important to understand what that revolution did to us.
It brought us power. It brought us mechanization, fertilizers.
Now you may prefer this loaf of bread.
Excuse my hands but this is how it is.
But actually the real relevant bread, historically, is this white Wonder loaf.
Never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people.
And never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact.
So as food became more plentiful, bread became cheaper.
We added in more sugar.
We add in raisins and oil and milk and all kinds of things to make bread, from a simple food into kind of a support for calories.
And today, bread now is associated with obesity, which is very strange.
And that's not only true in this country, it is true all over the world.
Bread has migrated to tropical countries, where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava.
So bread has become from a main staple, a source of calories associated with obesity and also a source of modernity, of modern life.
Can you actually bake bread? Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs?
We have become very removed from what our bread really is, which, again, evolutionarily speaking, is very strange.
In fact not many of you know that our bread, of course, was not a European invention.
If we do this, if we want to stay with traditional small-scale farming we are going, actually, to relegate these poor farmers and their husbands -- among whom I have lived for many years, working without electricity and water, to try to improve their food production -- we relegate them to poverty.
What they want are implements to increase their production: something to fertilize the soil, something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market.
We cannot just think that small-scale is the solution to the world food problem.
We do not need to spill the water if we don't want to.
And we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small-scale and large-scale.
We need to think that land is multi-functional.
And we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small-scale and large-scale.
We need to think that land is multi-functional.
It has different functions.
We need to help to lift them out of poverty.
We need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive.
Never before, as I said, has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few.

It's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity.
Who said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi, 75 years ago, when he spoke about bread.
He did not speak about rice, in India. He said, "To those who have to go without two meals a day, God can only appear as bread."
And that, I think, evolutionarily-speaking is unique.
We've never had that before.
So enjoy your bread.
We try to make big, permanent, important change.
But we don't think about it that way.
And we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like.
And he went to Reno and he did it again.
And when I think about what Nathan did, and when I think about what people here do, I think about ideas.
And I think about the idea that creating an idea, spreading an idea has a lot behind it.
And now we're in this new model of leadership, where the way we make change is not by using money or power to lever a system, but by leading.
So let me tell you about the three cycles. The first one is the factory cycle.
Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea.
And the problem we've run into is, we're running out of both.
Ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines.
So we shift gears for a minute, and say, "I know: television; advertising. Push push.
Lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe, or a church tribe, having a work tribe, having a community tribe.
But now, thanks to the internet, thanks to the explosion of mass media, thanks to a lot of other things that are bubbling through our society around the world, tribes are everywhere.
The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all.
We're just waiting for someone to lead us."
Michelle Kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture.
She doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time.
My friend Red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes.
Not fighting the organization that's fighting it -- fighting with them, leading them, connecting them, challenging the status quo because it's important to him.
And the people he surrounds himself with need the connection.

So ideas change states.
And I looked at India and said, really there are four kinds of ideas which really make an impact on India.
The first, to my mind, is what I call as "the ideas that have arrived."
But a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital.
Only if the people have education, they have good health, they have infrastructure, they have roads to go to work, they have lights to study at night -- only in those cases can you really get the benefit of a demographic dividend.
In other words, if you don't really invest in the human capital, the same demographic dividend can be a demographic disaster.
And when they wanted to have more advanced, more powerful computers they called them "advanced ledger posting machines."
So we have come a long way from those days where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment, and really has changed the way Indians think of technology.
And then I think the other point is that Indians today are far more comfortable with globalization.
Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society, but you are not able to implement those things.
And really there are four things here.
One is the question of education.
And really there are four things here.
One is the question of education.
For some reason, whatever reason -- lack of money, lack of priorities, because of religion having an older culture -- primary education was never given the focus it required.
From plunderer to recovering plunderer, to America's greenest CEO in five years -- that, frankly, was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999.
Asked later in the Canadian documentary, "The Corporation," what I meant by the "go to jail" remark, I offered that theft is a crime.
And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime.
Asked later in the Canadian documentary, "The Corporation," what I meant by the "go to jail" remark, I offered that theft is a crime.
And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime.
But I realized, for that to be true -- for theft of our children's future to be a crime -- there must be a clear, demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization, and is the major culprit, stealing our children's future, by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator --
That is, impact is generated by people, what they consume in their affluence, and how it is produced.
And though the equation is largely subjective, you can perhaps quantify people, and perhaps quantify affluence, but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify.
So the equation is conceptual.
And though the equation is largely subjective, you can perhaps quantify people, and perhaps quantify affluence, but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify.

Still it works to help us understand the problem.
Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total, going for 100 percent.
We have diverted 148 million pounds -- that's 74,000 tons -- of used carpet from landfills, closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago.
Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004, meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain, from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation -- independent third-party certified.

We call it Cool Carpet.
And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator, increasing sales and profits.
Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home, under the brand Flor, misspelled F-L-O-R.
You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days.
And this dispels a myth too, this false choice between the environment and the economy.
Our products are the best they've ever been, inspired by design for sustainability, an unexpected wellspring of innovation.
Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose.
Well, every day of my life since, "Tomorrow's Child" has spoken to me with one simple but profound message, which I presume to share with you.
We are, each and every one, a part of the web of life.
The continuum of humanity, sure, but in a larger sense, the web of life itself.
So I decided to try and write something more fun.
And I came up with an idea that I would write a cookbook.
And the title for my cookbook was going to be, "Dining Without Crumbs: The Art of Eating Over the Sink."
So I said, "Okay, if I have to do it --" I had a sabbatical. I said, "I'll write about my research, if there's no other way.
And then I'll get to do my cookbook."
So, I wrote a book on my research.
I can animate the lines.
And to the extent you believe I didn't shrink the lines, which I didn't, I've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you.
Now, the interesting thing about this is when I take the lines away, it's as if you haven't learned anything in the last minute.
And what happens?
People don't check, and they don't join.
The countries on the right, the ones that give a lot, have a slightly different form.
So I printed another version of this, where I eliminated the middle option.
I gave it to another 100 students. Here is what happened: Now the most popular option became the least popular, and the least popular became the most popular.
What was happening was the option that was useless, in the middle, was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it.
And I said, "So why don't you just stimulate the clitoris of the pig?
Why don't you have the farmers do that?
That's not one of your five steps."
And the woman would have sex with it.
That is what they would do. Pretty amazing.
Sadly, this device has been dismantled.
Kinsey thought it was bunk, so he got to work.
He got together in his lab 300 men, a measuring tape, and a movie camera.
And in fact, he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out.
YB: And we made a baby.
FN: Can you bring out our baby?
This baby is fully electric.
It goes 150 miles an hour.
It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle.
Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design.


I'm here because I have a very important message: I think we have found the most important factor for success.
A few had good grades.
I had a question in my mind: Would Hispanic kids react the same way as the American kids?
So I went to Colombia. And I reproduced the experiment.
I was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged by some strong male role models as well, including my father, my brother, uncles and grandfathers.
The men in my life taught me some important things, as well.
They taught me about what a respectful relationship should look like between men and women.
But Barack reminded us on that day, all of us in that room, that we all know what our world should look like.
We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like.
We all know.
We all know.
And he urged the people in that meeting, in that community, to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas, to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be, one and the same.
And I think about that today because I am reminded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of closing that gap.
But you have everything you need.
Everything you need to succeed, you already have, right here.
My husband works in this big office.
It was built by the timber of Her Majesty's Ship Resolute and given by Queen Victoria.
It's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations.
And its name, Resolute, is a reminder of the strength of character that's required not only to lead a country, but to live a life of purpose, as well.
Because we are counting on you.
We are counting on every single one of you to be the very best that you can be.
Because the world is big.
And I want to tell you about a project to save plants.
And the way that you save plants is by storing seeds.
Because seeds, in all their diverse glory, are plants' futures.
And the way that you save plants is by storing seeds.
Because seeds, in all their diverse glory, are plants' futures.
All the genetic information for future generations of plants So here is the building; it looks rather unassuming, really.

But it goes down below ground many stories.
The one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck, that is down to about 30 last remaining trees.
Fantastically useful plant, both for protein and for medicine.
We have training going on in China, in the USA, and many other countries.
Our public education, once a model for the world, has become most noteworthy for its failures.
Mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy eludes vast numbers of our students.
Despite having a research establishment that is the envy of the world, more than half of the American public don't believe in evolution.
We may be at the top of the list when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth.
We are not even on the list when it comes to our responsibility for the health of this democracy.
We are playing with fire.
Our ways of approaching agency and authority turn inside out to reflect the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century, and everyone has the responsibility for trying and participating in finding them.
Bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences in personal and professional objectives.
But the balances redressed, our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance.
And of course, this new wine needs new bottles if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism of this idea.
The most important discovery we made in our focus on public action was to appreciate that the hard choices are not between good and evil, but between competing goods.
This discovery is transforming.
So the challenge for Bennington is to do it.
On the cover of Bennington's 2008 holiday card is the architect's sketch of a building opening in 2010 that is to be a center for the advancement of public action.
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment.


Information technology grows in an exponential manner.
I'm going to show you this.
Man: The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life?
It's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance."
Fourth Man: I live happily because what else should I do?
Fifth Man: The first thing I remember ...  Fifth Man: ... from my childhood,  Fifth Man: we were having fun, biking.  Seventh Man: We invented stories, we flew around the world, while remaining in our attic.
Eighth Man: I had a big laugh today.
Now I am going to speak to you about my movie.
For the last three years, I was shooting the earth for the movie.
The name of the movie is "Home" -- "Maison."
The film is going to be distributed free.
This film has no copyright.
On the five of June, the environment day, everybody can download the movie on Internet.
On the five of June, the environment day, everybody can download the movie on Internet.
The film is given for free to the distributor for TV and theater to show it the fifth of June.
There is no business on this movie.
Here's why.
This is the U.N.'s population data, you may have seen, for the world.
And the world's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion, late this century.


What's happening to the climate?
We're wired for dangers that are immediate, that are physical, that are imminent, and so our body goes into an incredible reaction where endogenous opioids come in.
We have a system that is really ancient, and really there for physical danger.
And so over time, this becomes a stress response, which has enormous effects on the body.
The Freudian model is really one continuum that, as you get less miserable, you get happier.
And that isn't true -- when you get less miserable, you get less miserable.
And that happiness is a whole other end of the equation.
So that the body can both look for opportunity and also protect itself from danger, at the same time.
And they're sort of two reciprocal and dynamically interacting systems.
People have also wanted to deconstruct.
This was originally seen as a system that was the pleasure system of the brain.
In the 1950s, Olds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat.
And the rat would just keep pressing that bar thousands and thousands and thousands of times.

It wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex.
The other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal.
And we see here the smile.
And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips to the zygomatic major.
And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips to the zygomatic major.
It's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye, the orbicularis oculi.
So you see, even 10-month-old babies, when they see their mother, will show this particular kind of smile.

So you see, even 10-month-old babies, when they see their mother, will show this particular kind of smile.
Extroverts use it more than introverts.
See the problem is that, as humans, these three can separate.
So a person can be in a long term attachment, become romantically infatuated with someone else, and want to have sex with a third person.
The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray is in social status.
The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray is in social status.
We are very acutely aware of our social status and always seek to further and increase it.
Now in the animal world, there is only one way to increase status, and that's dominance.
This is the gecko's solution. They actually peel their toes away from the surface, at high rates, as they run up the wall.
Well I'm really excited today to show you the newest version of a robot, Stickybot, using a new hierarchical dry adhesive.
Here is the actual robot.

There it is.
There it is.
And now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the Stanford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot.
Oh. One thing I want to point out is, look at Stickybot.
And now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the Stanford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot.
Oh. One thing I want to point out is, look at Stickybot.
You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko.
And when I went back to research this, I realized that one of the great TED moments in the past, from Nathan, we've talked about an active tail.
Video: Myhrvold thinks tail-cracking dinosaurs were interested in love, not war.
Robert Full: He talked about the tail being a whip for communication.
It can also be used in defense.
Pretty powerful.
So we then went back and looked at the animal.
So we then went back and looked at the animal.
And we ran it up a surface.
But this time what we did is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there.
But this time what we did is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there.
And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips. This is slowed down 10 times.
So here is normal speed.
And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips. This is slowed down 10 times.
So here is normal speed.
And watch it now slip, and see what it does with its tail.
Okay, now we wondered, if we were right, we should be able to test this in a physical model, in a robot.
So for TED we actually built a robot, over there, a prototype, with the tail.
And we're going to attempt the first air-righting response in a tail, with a robot.
There it is.
And it works just like it does in the animal.
So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself.
And it works just like it does in the animal.
So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself.
Now, of course, we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations, so we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.
And it works just like it does in the animal.
So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself.
Now, of course, we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations, so we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.
It does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled.
This is sort of incredible. But actually it's quite beautiful, when you take a picture of it.
And it's better than that, it -- just in the slide -- maneuvers in mid-air.
It can actually swim through the air.
But watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing?
What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight?
Stay tuned for that.
So then we wondered, "Can they actually maneuver with this?"
So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it with these capabilities? Here it is in the wind tunnel.
So then we wondered, "Can they actually maneuver with this?"
So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it with these capabilities? Here it is in the wind tunnel.
And it certainly looks like it.
You can see it even better from down on top.
Watch the animal.
Definitely moving towards the landing target.
And the next video you see is the first time we've showed this.
This is the actual video -- not staged, a real research video -- of animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line.
Look at the end to see the animal.
This is the actual video -- not staged, a real research video -- of animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line.

But then as it gets closer to the tree, look at the close-up. And see if you can see it land.
Look at the end to see the animal.

And I got distracted by it.
And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent, when I should have been talking to my clients.
And reaching success, I always did what I loved.
Well, soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was, outwardly very successful, but inwardly very depressed.
But I'm a guy; I knew how to fix it.
I bought a fast car.
And I woke up one day and I said, "I don't need Prozac anymore."
And I threw it away and haven't needed it since.
I learned that success isn't a one-way street.
And I threw it away and haven't needed it since.
I learned that success isn't a one-way street.
It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.
I learned that success isn't a one-way street.
It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.
It's a continuous journey.
I mean, what is a biosphere?
Back then, yes, I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right?
Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one.
And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe -- if we were going to go to Mars, for instance, would we take a biosphere with us, to live in it?
We also wanted to know so we can understand more about the Earth that we all live in.
Well, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby.
We also wanted to know so we can understand more about the Earth that we all live in.
Well, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby.
Let's take it on a maiden voyage.
And boy do we stink out here.
Not only that, but I lost touch of where my food came from.
I had been growing all my own food.
I want to talk about the transformed media landscape, and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world.
And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation.
I'll start here. Last November there was a presidential election.
But there is a curious asymmetry here.
The media that is good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups.
And the media that's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations.
The media that is good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups.
And the media that's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations.
If you want to have a conversation in this world, you have it with one other person.
It's as if, when you bought a book, they threw in the printing press for free; it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons.
That is a huge change in the media landscape we're used to.
And it's not just Internet or no Internet.
It's still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well.
Second story.
Last May, China in the Sichuan province had a terrible earthquake, 7.9 magnitude, massive destruction in a wide area, as the Richter Scale has it.
And because of the social connections, Chinese students coming elsewhere, and going to school, or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China -- there were people listening all over the world, hearing this news.
The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter.
Twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the US Geological Survey had anything up online for anybody to read.
The audience can talk back.
And that's a little freaky. But you can get used to it after a while, as people do.
But that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of.
And many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk.
It was Senator Obama when they created it. They changed the name later.
"Please get FISA right."
But I wanted to reach out to you and say, I understand that you disagree with me, and I'm going to take my lumps on this one."
This didn't please anybody. But then a funny thing happened in the conversation.
People in that group realized that Obama had never shut them down.
And it makes anything possible, makes anything rationalizable.
And the thing is, though, if you looked at my brain during those years in the Moonies -- neuroscience is expanding exponentially, as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding.
We're beginning to look inside the brain.
And it makes anything possible, makes anything rationalizable.
And the thing is, though, if you looked at my brain during those years in the Moonies -- neuroscience is expanding exponentially, as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding.
We're beginning to look inside the brain.
And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this, and compared it to anyone in this room, or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis, I am convinced it would look very, very different.
And that, strange as it may sound, gives me hope.
And the reason that gives me hope is that the first thing is to admit that we have a problem.
And that, strange as it may sound, gives me hope.
And the reason that gives me hope is that the first thing is to admit that we have a problem.
But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem, if you will.
But there was a pretty big problem with this.
After these very long, painstaking operations, attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before, the patients died.
They died of massive infection.
The question had to be asked, "Well, can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions?"
Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery: surgery with long instruments through small incisions.
And it really changed the landscape of surgery.
And one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the external ergonomics are terrible.
You've got these long instruments, and you're working off your centerline.
And the instruments are essentially working backwards.
So what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand, and put it on the other side of that small incision, is you need to put a wrist on that instrument.
And so -- I get to talk about robots -- the da Vinci robot put just that wrist on the other side of that incision.
And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist.
So what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand, and put it on the other side of that small incision, is you need to put a wrist on that instrument.

And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist.
More useful than a solid gold surgeon, but, still, it's a fairly big capital investment.
But once you've got it, your procedure costs do come down.
But there are other barriers.
We need to see beyond the surface.
We need to be able to guide what we're cutting in a much better way.
This is a cancer surgery.
"I don't know, guys.
I don't want to get in trouble."
"Okay. One bite. What the hell?"
The good NGOs, like Oxfam, are very keen on this idea.
They want to have the discipline and accountability.
So that's a way to get basic services scaled up.
But by the end of the 20th century, a new generation of critics and reformers had come to see philanthropy just this way.
The thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about -- and that's exactly what is happening -- is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions, for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected, in service of the long term.
This entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters.
And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders, like many of the people here, by new tools, like the ones we've seen here, and by new pressures.
I've been following this change for quite a while now, and participating in it.
This report is our main public report.
Suddenly big things can be done for love."
Watch, this spring, for Paul Hawken's new book -- Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about.
The book is called "Blessed Unrest."
The punchline to your journey? Look at the horizon.
Yes, it's uphill the entire way, because the South Pole is at 10,000 feet, and you're starting at sea level.
Our journey did not, in fact, begin at Hercules Inlet, where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica.
And I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...
that the correct summit -- that all of our students, every high school graduate should know -- should be statistics: probability and statistics.
I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject.
It's something which is suspended between what we believe we can be, and a tradition we may have forgotten.
And I think, when I listen to these incredible people here, I've been so inspired -- so many incredible ideas, so many visions.
And yet, when I look at the environment outside, you see how resistant architecture is to change.
I think expression.
And it's like espresso coffee, you know, you take the essence of the coffee.
That's what expression is.
It's actually a story in which our acts themselves are pushing the story in a particular way.
So again I am a believer in the radical architecture.
You know the Soviet architecture of that building is the conservation.
So again, the evasion of that sphere, which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture, the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object has never appealed to me.
And I do believe that this interaction with the history, with history that is often very difficult, to grapple with it, to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique.
Because architecture is also the asking of questions.
A space that doesn't always follow us like a dog that has been trained to follow us, but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating other possibilities, other experiences, that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture.
And of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy.
And so I do like something which is pointed, not blunt, something which is focused on reality, something that has the power, through its leverage, to transform even a very small space.
There would be nowhere to turn.
The memorable, I think, is really our world, what we think the world is.
And it's not only our memory, but those who remember us, which means that architecture is not mute.

And it's not only our memory, but those who remember us, which means that architecture is not mute.
It's an art of communication.
And it's not only our memory, but those who remember us, which means that architecture is not mute.
It's an art of communication.
It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires.
Create a shopping center, a swimming place that is more like a museum than like entertainment.
And these are our dreams.
And of course risk. I think architecture should be risky.
And these are our dreams.
And of course risk. I think architecture should be risky.
You know it costs a lot of money and so on, but yes, it should not play it safe.
Where people cannot speak, cannot vote, cannot do anything.
We too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful.
And yet when I think of the poverty of society which doesn't give freedom to its people, I don't admire those buildings.
Where people cannot speak, cannot vote, cannot do anything.
We too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful.
And yet when I think of the poverty of society which doesn't give freedom to its people, I don't admire those buildings.
I think nothing good will come out of that.
I think architecture is about consensus.
And it is about the dirty word "compromise." Compromise is not bad.
The other thing that's kind of cool is that you look at this and in the media when people say design, they actually mean style.
And I'm really here to talk about design.
But you know the object is just a pivot.
And I think part of that is that they never delegated understanding.
And I think in our family we were very lucky, because we learned about design backwards.
Design was not something other.
And I think in our family we were very lucky, because we learned about design backwards.
Design was not something other.
It was part of the business of life in general.
Girl: Y-I-N-D-I-A-N-A.
ED: And then Embassy Row is actually a historical site, because in the Kymaerican story this is where the Parisian Diaspora started, where there embassy was.
So you can actually visit and have this three-dimensional fictional experience there.
And part of why this stuff is important and all the things that we do are important, is that these are the ideas we need.
And I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey.
That's what we all need to do.
What is it about animation, graphics, illustrations, that create meaning?
And this is an important question to ask and answer because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning, the better we can communicate, and, I also think, the better we can think and collaborate together.
So this year we're going to visualize how the brain visualizes.
Look at a hand. Look at a remote control. Chair. Book.
So that's the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something.
A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream.
And if you closed your eyes you'd be able to mentally navigate it.
You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that.
The third part that I'd like to talk about is the limbic system.
You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that.
The third part that I'd like to talk about is the limbic system.
And this is deep inside of the brain. It's very old, evolutionarily.

So the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank in Cambodia was bombed.
But not just that, they actually banned money.
I think it's the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used.

So it was about four years ago, five years ago, I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was, with a bag similar to this.
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.
It's like "mission accomplished."
So I might be doing something dumb, just like he was doing at the time.
But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.
This thing can be stuck, like that little green triangle up there, sort of symbolizing this right now.
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.
And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it.
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.
And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it.
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like, like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular, because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like, like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular, because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.
It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it.
And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.
They are the drivers of history, as we see by looking at history.
1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like.
Well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had 1,000 years ago.
These are people busy getting out of poverty just as fast as they can.
They're helping each other do it.
They're doing it through an outlaw thing, the informal economy.
They're helping each other do it.
They're doing it through an outlaw thing, the informal economy.
The informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics: it's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.
We're going to keep being surprised. And almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones.
From your standpoint this means a great increase in climate refugees over the coming decades, and what goes along with that, which is resource wars and chaos wars, as we're seeing in Darfur.
That's what drought does.
So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity: coal, some gas, nuclear and hydro.
Of those, only nuclear and hydro are green.
Coal is what is causing the climate problems.

Of those, only nuclear and hydro are green.
Coal is what is causing the climate problems.
And as those events keep happening we're going to say, "Okay, what can we do about that really?"
But there's this little problem with geoengineering: what body is going to decide who gets to engineer? How much they do? Where they do it?
Because everybody is downstream, downwind of whatever is done.
"Oh! That was my foot there!"
She wasn't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not.
And in that whole idea, how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space?
"Does it matter if I am in the world or not?"
"And does it matter whether the kind of actions I take filter into a sense of responsibility?"
Is art about that?
These kinds of experiments, they filter into architectural models.
These are ongoing experiments.
One is an experiment I did for BMW, an attempt to make a car.
It's quite simple and fundamental.
I've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland.
And as you come to a new valley, as you come to a new landscape, you have a certain view.
I've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland.
And as you come to a new valley, as you come to a new landscape, you have a certain view.
If you stand still, the landscape doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is.
And eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies.
And we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out, but we got 10 times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device.
This device was just FDA approved in the last year.
And in fact this is probably why mostly men, boys, are psychopathic killers, or are very aggressive.
Because a daughter can get one X from the father, one X from the mother, it's kind of diluted out.
But for a son, he can only get the X chromosome from his mother.
But for a son, he can only get the X chromosome from his mother.
So this is how it's passed from mother to son.
And it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development, which is kind of interesting because serotonin is supposed to make you calm and relaxed.
But the bad news is that your cousin is also Lizzie Borden.
Now I said, "Okay, so what? We have Lizzie."
She goes, "No it gets worse, read this book."
And here is this "Killed Strangely," and it's this historical book.
And the first murder of a mother by a son was my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.
Okay, so that's the first case of matricide.
They have the same brain, and the same EEG.
And now they are close as can be.
But there's gonna be bad news somewhere.
UVB turns out to be incredibly important.
It's very destructive, but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin, vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones, the health of our immune system, and myriad other important functions in our bodies.
So, living at the equator, we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin -- this wonderful, complex, ancient polymer compound in our skin -- served as a superb natural sunscreen.
Melanin, in various forms, has probably been on the Earth a billion years, and has been recruited over and over again by evolution, as often happens.
Why change it if it works?
So melanin was recruited, in our lineage, and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in Africa, to be a natural sunscreen.
We have to, if we're lightly pigmented, be careful about the problems of skin cancer, and destruction of folate in our bodies, by lots of sun.
Epidemiologists and doctors have been very good about telling us about protecting our skin.
What they haven't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas, or working inside all the time.
You can touch it.
You can understand it.
Take it out of this room.
Then take Iran itself, and what people are doing today: following what happened to Neda, people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people who are blogging out of Iran, any by everybody who is blogging, changing their address to Tehran, Iran, and making it difficult for the security services.
Take, therefore, what modern technology is capable of: the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally.
That, in my view, gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world.
We are the first generation which is in a position to do this.
Combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally, with the challenges that we now face, most of which are global in their nature.
Climate change cannot be solved in one country, but has got to be solved by the world working together.
One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well, so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations.
Take the financial crisis.
If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York or starts in the sub-prime market of the United States of America.
A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you, and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are.
That is snobbery.
The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery.
When we think about failing in life, when we think about failure, one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income, a loss of status.
What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others. And it exists.
The number one organ of ridicule, nowadays, is the newspaper.
In other words, they have failed. And they are described as "losers."
Now, is there any alternative to this?
I think the Western tradition shows us one glorious alternative, which is tragedy.
And I suppose I'm arguing that we should learn a little bit about what's happening in tragic art.
It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser.
He is not a loser, though he has lost.
Here's an insight that I've had about success: You can't be successful at everything.
We hear a lot of talk about work-life balance.
Nonsense. You can't have it all. You can't.
I'm an artist and an engineer, which is, increasingly, a more common kind of hybrid.
But I still fall into this weird crack where people don't seem to understand me.
And I was looking around and I found this wonderful picture.
And as you do, you see the shadows of your own speech.
And they sort of fly away, out of your head.
If a computer speech recognition system is able to recognize what you're saying, then it spells it out.
So there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there.
And so I've been beginning, with a variety of different projects, to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes.
And basically to ask the questions: What if art was aware that we were looking at it?
And so I've been beginning, with a variety of different projects, to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes.
And basically to ask the questions: What if art was aware that we were looking at it?
How could it respond, in a way, to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we're looking at it?
And all over the world, eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this.
And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life, and how he changed our thinking.
I say almost every aspect, because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on.

The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees; our ancestors went out onto the plain.
That explained everything.
We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass, or to chase after animals, or to free our hands for weapons.
I mean, it's a terrible thing to happen.
You've got this beautiful paradigm.
You've believed it through generations.
You've believed it through generations.
Nobody has questioned it.
You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it, relying on it to be as solid as a rock.
Well, we know the answer because Thomas S. Kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in 1962.
He said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is, guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened.
If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.
And we just record what we see."
Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!
He knew all about that kind of science.
Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!
He knew all about that kind of science.
And he called it hypothesis-free science.
David Attenborough thinks it's significant, as the possible beginning of our bipedalism.
Look at the fat layer.
We have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over: nothing in the least like that in any other primate.
And then again, there is the fact that we are streamlined.
Trying to imagine a diver diving into water -- hardly makes a splash.
Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver, and you can see that, compared with gorilla, we are halfway to being shaped like a fish.
It's never been done.
I ask people sometimes, and they say, "I like the aquatic theory!
Everybody likes the aquatic theory.


Take a look at this picture.
But the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period, effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas -- a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.
And they soon adopted rules which slowed down innovation and cut China off from the rest of the world.
So as other countries in the world innovated, in the sense both of developing newer technologies, but also developing newer rules, the Chinese were cut off from those advances.
Income there stayed stagnant, as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.
This next chart looks at more recent data.
It plots income, average income in China as a percentage of average income in the United States.
The city can be built.
And we can scale this model.
We can go do it over and over again.
Now, where else might this model be tried?
Well, Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa.
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule.


There's an old saying, "Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it's not there."
And how I set about that, I got some splinters of wood.
And I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass, constructed this little apartment.
Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished.
And I say, "Yes, they're all for you."
And they moved in, and decided not to pay me any rent.
And from there I was watching this little world.
And then he said to me, "I don't believe you can do it. Can you really do it?"
And I says, "Well, try me."
And then he said, "But I don't believe that you can do this." So I said, "OK."
And then pushing the glass in with its own friction.
And as I was doing it, what happened?
The instrument that I used turned into a catapult.
So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off.
I think he was just warning him actually.
But this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt.
I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end.
Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle?
Audience: No.
I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end.
Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle?
Audience: No.
And I looked at it underneath the microscope.
That was the paintbrush.
And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful, because the paint starts to turn into little blobs.
And I bent it 'round, and made it into the chariot.
And the horse is made from nylon.
And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse.
I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle.
Because we know we see needles, but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle apart from putting a thread through it.
So I broke the needle.
And his mouth must be probably about three microns.
So the eyes are probably about one micron or something.
That ship there, that's made from 24-karat gold.
So the eyes are probably about one micron or something.
That ship there, that's made from 24-karat gold.
And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider.
The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold.
It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right.
As you can see, dressage.
So -- someone's done that up.
Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone and got some water from the River Cherwell, and the River Thames, that flow through here. And this is the water.
But I got to thinking, you know, if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.
You just scoop the water up.
Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.
That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.
That is safe, sterile drinking water.
Cheers.
There you go Chris.
Michael Pritchard: Okay.
Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?
Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.

It'll last for 6,000 liters.
When you run the numbers on a calculator, you run out of noughts.
So here is the "thinking different" bit.
Instead of shipping water, and using man-made processes to do it, let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.
Instead of shipping water, and using man-made processes to do it, let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.
She picks the water up from there, desalinates it, for free, transports it over there, and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.
And where do people live? Near water.
About half a cent a day to run.
Thank you.
So, by thinking differently, and processing water at the point of use, mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water.
This is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley.
This is a story about an engineer at J.R. West.
They're the people who make the bullet train.
It's extremely inexpensive and rechargeable every five years.
It's actually a company a company that I'm involved in called OneSun, with Paul Hawken.
There are many many ways that nature filters water that takes salt out of water.
Actually G.M. Opel used it to create that skeleton you see, in what's called their bionic car.
It lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material, as an organism must, for the maximum amount of strength.
This beetle, unlike this chip bag here, this beetle uses one material, chitin.

Which is to create conditions conducive to life.
Now in order to do this, the design challenge of our century, I think, we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses, and to somehow meet them again.
One of the big ideas, one of the big projects I've been honored to work on is a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it.
And I come from a long way.
I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me.
It's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world, telling my story in form of a book.
And so I made a commitment. I say, "I'm gonna not eat my breakfast."
I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month, but I've been humbled.
So it's taken me 232 days.
It's an awesome idea. Doesn't work.
And eventually, after five or ten minutes, most people figure out the solution, which you can see here.
The key is to overcome what's called functional fixedness.

You look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks.
But that's not happening here.
You've got an incentive designed to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity, and it does just the opposite.
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.
Because when the tacks are out of the box, it's pretty easy isn't it?
If-then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks, where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to.
Rewards, by their very nature, narrow our focus, concentrate the mind; that's why they work in so many cases.
I want to talk today only about autonomy.
In the 20th century, we came up with this idea of management.
Management did not emanate from nature.

Somebody invented it.
And so, in fact, he actually set about doing a variety of things.
Built the Tesla coil. This tower was built on Long Island back at the beginning of the 1900s.
And the idea was, it was supposed to be able to transfer power anywhere on Earth.
What Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology, which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room.
It's a resonant phenomenon for which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award, which is nicknamed the Genius Award, So how does it work?
Imagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers, there's a capacitor attached to it too.
Imagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers, there's a capacitor attached to it too.
And if you can cause that coil to resonate, what will happen is it will pulse at alternating current frequencies -- at a fairly high frequency, by the way.
And if you can bring another device close enough to the source, that will only work at exactly that frequency, you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple, and transfer magnetic energy between them.

And if you can bring another device close enough to the source, that will only work at exactly that frequency, you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple, and transfer magnetic energy between them.
It stays within either what we call the source, or within the device.
And actually, the magnetic fields we're using are basically about the same as the Earth's magnetic field.
We live in a magnetic field.
So we put a little sleeve on the back, but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too.
And those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center.
And Nokia as well.

And Asia could have social development before they got the economic development.
So to me, as a public health professor, it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now.
Because what you see here, what you see here is the flat world of Thomas Friedman, isn't it.
This is East Asia, and the light blue there is South Asia.
And this is how the world changed.
It changed like this.
And it goes over here?
And I come now, into projections, but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there, you know, because --  that's where the projections are not valid any longer.
Probably the world will do this.
And how fast has this happened?
Well, MDG 4.
The United States has not been so eager to use MDG 4.
And how fast has this happened?
Well, MDG 4.
The United States has not been so eager to use MDG 4.
And there are others who are extremely high.
And I will show you that what has happened in one of the best countries, with the most vibrant economy in Africa and a good governance, Botswana.
They have a very high level. It's coming down.
And this is the situation you see.
It's not deep poverty. It's the special situation, probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population in some countries, or some parts of countries, in south and eastern Africa.
Don't make it Africa. Don't make it a race issue.
Comic books. Quantum physics video games.
And Zero wants to go to the moon.
In 2007, Zero launched a green campaign, suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m.
The idea is simple, basic. It's not original, but it's important, and it's important to participate.

Imagine that. 7,100 apples with names.
Today, 6,800 of those are extinct, no longer to be seen again.
I used to have a list of these extinct apples, and when I would go out and give a presentation, I would pass the list out in the audience.
So, I want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the Fowler apple is still out there.
And there's an old book back here, and I want to read a piece from it.
This book was published in 1904.
See, we used to have a lot of apples.
And the Fowler apple is described in here -- I hope this doesn't surprise you -- as, "a beautiful fruit."
I don't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us, but ...
Today's best variety is tomorrow's lunch for insects or pests or disease.
The other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we're going to need for climate change that the others don't.
So it's not necessary, thank God, that the Fowler apple is the best apple in the world.

It's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good, unique trait.
The coldest growing seasons of the future, hotter than the hottest of the past.
Is agriculture adapted to that?
I don't know. Can fish play the piano?
I'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs: actually losing it, never to be seen again.
So, a number of us got together and decided that, you know, enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of -- maybe not the most charismatic diversity.
You don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear, but it's very important diversity.
It's a backup system for all the seed banks. Storage is free.
It operates like a safety deposit box.
Norway owns the mountain and the facility, but the depositors own the seed.
The World Health Organization estimates -- well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people.
They also have an estimate of around a billion.
But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now, which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population.
And they were people who were not short of wit, or grace or energy, but they had no hope, no jobs, no prospects.
And when people aren't allowed to be useful, they soon think that they're useless.
And although that was great for the music business at the time, it wasn't much good for anything else.
I think what this is all about, this whole movement which is growing from the margins, remains quite small.
Nothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont.
What it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social.
Nothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont.
What it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social.
It's already immersed in social networks.
In recent years, a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won.
History was over and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy.
But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today and how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago, just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France.
But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today and how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago, just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France.
Then, people said monarchy dominated everywhere because it was rooted in human nature.
We were naturally deferential. We needed hierarchy.
And whereas then monarchies, palaces and forts dominated every city skyline and looked permanent and confident, today it's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city.
I'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost, though that might be quite tempting.
But I do think we're on the verge of a period when, just as happened to the monarchy and, interestingly, the military too, the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end, and it's going to steadily move to the sides, the margins of our society, transformed from being a master into a servant, a servant to the productive economy and of human needs.

And as that happens, we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism, which is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks, it's not a self-sufficient system.
And as that happens, we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism, which is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks, it's not a self-sufficient system.
It depends on other systems, on ecology, on family, on community, and if these aren't replenished, capitalism suffers too.
And our human nature isn't just selfish, it's also compassionate.
It's not just competitive, it's also caring.
Because of the depth of the crisis, I think we are at a moment of choice.
The crisis is almost certainly deepening around us.
So what does this all mean?
Well, there is still a lot to explore in its early days. And there's not many people working in this field.
But consider for a moment that sound does have form.
There's a guy with a flame thrower there, giving me what for.
One of the things that a stuntman often does, and you'll see it every time in the big movies, is be blown through the air.
Well, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that's all they had.
Well, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that's all they had.
And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air, and hopefully you make it look good.
Now we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram.
That's the piston that was fired out of the floor.
We can flip lorries, coaches, buses, anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power.  It's a great job, really.  It's such fun!
You should hear some of the phone conversations that I have with people on my Bluetooth in the shop.
They first dropped some dummies.
So that's the balloon, big gas balloon.
It's that shape because the helium has to expand.
I did quite a lot of research.
And you'll see in a second there, he comes back down to the floor.
Now just to give you some perspective of this balloon, the little black dots are people.
It's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous.
That's in New Mexico.
That's the U.S. Air Force Museum.
I contacted a company in the States who make suits for NASA.
That's a current suit. This was me last year with their chief engineer.
That suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars.
Most of the time, art and science stare at each other across a gulf of mutual incomprehension.
There is great confusion when the two look at each other.
Art, of course, looks at the world through the psyche, the emotions -- the unconscious at times -- and of course the aesthetic.
In the Extreme Ice Survey, we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together, to merging the art and science to the end of helping us understand nature and humanity's relationship with nature better.
Specifically, I as a person who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life, am firmly of the belief that photography, video, film have tremendous powers for helping us understand and shape the way we think about nature and about ourselves in relationship to nature.
In this project, we're specifically interested, of course, in ice.
We've done films. We've done books. We have more coming.
We have a site on Google Earth that Google Earth was generous enough to give us, and so forth, because we feel very much the need to tell this story, because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now.
Now, one bit of science before we get into the visuals.
Right now, if you look at the top right part of that graph, we're at 385 parts per million.
We are way, way outside the normal, natural variability.
Earth is having a fever.
This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months.
You see the glacier flowing in from the right, dropping off into the sea, camera shooting every hour.
If you look in the middle background, you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo-yo.
That means that glacier's floating and it's unstable, and you're about to see the consequences of that floating.
To give you a little bit of a sense of scale, that calving face in this picture is about 325 feet tall. That's 32 stories.
This is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center.
That's where it started.
That's where it ended a few months ago.
And on up to Greenland.
The calving face is four and a half miles across, and in this shot, as we pull back, you're only seeing about a mile and a half.
So, imagine how big this is and how much ice is charging out.
The interior of Greenland is to the right.
We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago, as you can see. June 25th, monster calving events happened.
I'll show you one of those in a second.
This glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past 15 years.
We have a problem of perception.
The policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues, but we actually can deal with them.
I'm certain that we can.
I'm certain that we can.
But what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet.
You're an elite audience. You get it.
The passengers who fell off the Titanic fell into water of just five degrees centigrade.
Fresh water freezes at zero.
And the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7.
And I then went and did a huge amount of training, swimming in icy water, backwards and forwards.
But the most important thing was to train my mind to prepare myself for what was going to happen.
And I had to visualize the swim.
And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy with my father, was just going out the window.
There is no possibility that this was going to happen.
And I remember then getting out of the shower and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands.
And then we walked out onto the ice.
And I remember looking into the ice, and there were big chunks of white ice in there, and the water was completely black.
I had never seen black water before.
Child: His was on the grass.
So the three-year-old does two things differently.
First, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich that's really his.
And now what we've started to do in my lab is to put children into the brain scanner and ask what's going on in their brain as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts.
So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ, being used while children are thinking about other people.
But it's not quite like the adult brain.
And we can compare that to another case, where everything in the real world is the same.
The powder is still sugar, but what's different is what Grace thinks.
Now she thinks the powder is sugar.
And perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend's coffee, people say she deserves no blame at all.
Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it's really sugar, now people say she deserves a lot of blame, even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same.
And in fact, they say she deserves more blame in this case, the failed attempt to harm, than in another case, which we call an accident.
Whereas on the right, where there was a lot of activity, people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief, and said she deserved a lot less blame for causing the accident.
So that's good, but of course what we'd rather is have a way to interfere with function in this brain region, and see if we could change people's moral judgment.
And we do have such a tool.
CA: Is your work going to lead to any recommendations in education, to perhaps bring up a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments?
RS: That's one of the idealistic hopes.
The whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new.
And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity.
I refer to organized crime.
Now organized crime has been around for a very long time, I hear you say, and these would be wise words, indeed.

Now organized crime has been around for a very long time, I hear you say, and these would be wise words, indeed.
But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP.
The European Union, which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization, transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history, eventually comprising some 500 million people.
And a significant minority of those 500 million people like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes, sticking 50 Euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers.
Now, organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business.
And a significant minority of those 500 million people like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes, sticking 50 Euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers.
Now, organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business.
It has zones of production, like Afghanistan and Columbia.
And why is it? Because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region.
In the year 2000, 80 percent of the world's coltan was sourced to the killing fields of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
Now, coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone, in almost every laptop and games console.
The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world.
So if you can smuggle them into the E.U., there are very handsome profits to be made, and I want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups.
This boat is worth one million Euros when it's new.
You would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers which are objectively not in their interest.
And it was very soon when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this, of course, the quickest way to a person's wallet is through the promise of sex and love.
I expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus, one of the very great worldwide viruses that came.
As you can see, sometimes a subspecies branches off.
And quite often we sit in a design meeting and we discover that there is this great idea.
It doesn't really work in this context.
But for another client in another culture, it could really be the right answer to a different question.
So as a result, we never throw anything out.
We keep our office almost like an archive of architectural biodiversity.
And at the same time, we got invited to exhibit at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week.
So we thought like, this is too much of an opportunity, so we hired a feng shui master.
We scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions, and went to China.
So we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of state financed propaganda, images, statements, but no real experience.
So just like with a bike, we don't talk about it.
You can try it.
Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz, and there is only energy. And you can't see energy.
So everything that matters, that's important, is invisible.
One slightly silly thing that's invisible is this story, which is invisible to you.
A photo is not enough."
So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in.
And on the photograph, he wrote with a flourish, "To Horse Face, with love from Geoffrey Dickens, M.P."
I bet he thought he wished he was invisible, don't you?
So, one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see we also can't understand.
Gravity is one thing that we can't see and which we don't understand.
So, one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can't see we also can't understand.
Gravity is one thing that we can't see and which we don't understand.
It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest.
But we can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough.
But we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing.
In the Sufi faith, this great Middle Eastern religion, which some claim is the route of all religions, Sufi masters are all telepaths, so they say.
But we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing.
In the Sufi faith, this great Middle Eastern religion, which some claim is the route of all religions, Sufi masters are all telepaths, so they say.
But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.
I'm an ignostic.
I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists, until somebody properly defines the terms.
Another thing we can't see is the human genome.
The universe disappears.
The more light there is, the less you can see.
Time, nobody can see time.
The more light there is, the less you can see.
Time, nobody can see time.
I don't know if you know this. Modern physics, there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient for the figures.
Gas, you can't see that.
Interesting. Somebody mentioned 1600 recently.
Gas was invented in 1600 by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont.
But well done, him.
There is so many things that -- Light.
You can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum, if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes, you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists will disagree with this.
Thomas Edison once said, "We don't know one percent of one millionth about anything."
And I've come to the conclusion -- because you've asked this other question, "What's another thing you can't see?"
The point, most of us. What's the point?
They don't usually fade in and out.
They are rather sudden, and they change suddenly.
Charles Lullin, the grandfather, saw hundreds of different figures, different landscapes of all sorts.
But if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus, they may hallucinate faces, and this is exactly what you find in some of these people.
There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented, and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations.
There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons.
Right. So what has changed?
It's not better public transportation.
So that's one reason to think that we might be declensionists, going in the wrong direction.
They had none of that.
But they had an amazing freedom, which was they didn't have to make any money from it.
The Internet has no business plan, never did.
So what is this bizarre architecture configuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual?
Well, to move data around from one place to another -- again, it's not like a package courier.
It's more like a mosh pit.
Well, to move data around from one place to another -- again, it's not like a package courier.
It's more like a mosh pit.
Imagine, you being part of a network where, you're maybe at a sporting event, and you're sitting in rows like this, and somebody asks for a beer, and it gets handed at the aisle.
We turn to the person on the right, and we tell that person what we see on our left, and vice versa.
And they can lather, rinse, repeat. And before you know it, you have a general sense of where everything is.
This is how Internet addressing and routing actually work.
And here is the message where one of them says, "Looks like we've got a live one. We have a hijacking of YouTube!
This is not a drill. It's not just the cluelessness of YouTube engineers. I promise.
Something is up in Pakistan."
The good news is random people apparate from nowhere, put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise.
I was trying to think of the right model to describe this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers.
You know, it's just like the hail goes out and people are ready to help.
I have a theory I can explain later.
Suffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia stir-fried with pimentos.
But now, Wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work.
So what we see --  what we see in this phenomenon is something that the crazed, late traffic engineer Hans Monderman discovered in the Netherlands, and here in South Kensington, that sometimes if you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else, you can actually end up with a safer environment in which people can function, and one in which they are more human with each other.
They're realizing that they have to take responsibility for what they do.
And Wikipedia has embraced this.
They just didn't think it was the right thing to do.
It was an act of kindness.
And to this day, the page for Star Wars Kid has a warning right at the top that says you are not to put his real name on the page.
I know they look silly. And sure they look silly.
They start off on all sorts of goofy projects.
This is my favorite goofy blog: Catsthatlooklikehitler.com.
And then have technology that the person taking the photo will know later, this person requested to be contacted before this goes anywhere big, if you don't mind.
And that person taking the photo can make a decision about how and whether to respect it.
In the real world, we see filtering of this sort taking place in Pakistan.
And if you're wondering, no, there have been no known fatalities associated with CouchSurfing.
Although, to be sure, the reputation system, at the moment, works that you leave your report after the couch surfing experience, so there may be some selection bias there.
So, my urging, my thought, is that the Internet isn't just a pile of information.
And again, I think this is kind of false.
But I think a much bigger problem with this is that this logic -- that we should be dropping iPods not bombs -- I mean, it would make a fascinating title for Thomas Friedman's new book.
But this is rarely a good sign. Right?
Well my theory is that it's happening because censorship actually is less effective than you think it is in many of those places.
The moment you put something critical in a blog, even if you manage to ban it immediately, it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs.
So the more you block it, the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship and thus win in this cat-and-mouse game.
But I think the biggest conceptual pitfall that cybertopians made is when it comes to digital natives, people who have grown up online.
We often hear about cyber activism, how people are getting more active because of the Internet.
Rarely hear about cyber hedonism, for example, how people are becoming passive.
Why? Because they somehow assume that the Internet is going to be the catalyst of change that will push young people into the streets, while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography.
That's not an option being considered too strongly.
So for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran, there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft.
So for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran, there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft.
And this is realistic. And there is nothing wrong about it because the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people and it plays a completely different social role for them.
If you look at some of the surveys on how the young people actually benefit from the Internet, you'll see that the number of teenagers in China, for example, for whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life, is three times more than in the United States.


Okay, so 90 percent of my photographic process is, in fact, not photographic.
And oddly, the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World, a seemingly innocuous site.
And it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence: "Especially during these violent times, I personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to."
Photography threatens fantasy.
And it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence: "Especially during these violent times, I personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to."
Photography threatens fantasy.
They didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs, and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth.
I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen, self-imposed and real, and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge.
It was a critical moment in American history and global history where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes, but what I came away with is a photograph.
And it's just another place from which to observe, and the understanding that there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.
And the outsider can never really reach the core.
I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.
However, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.
And in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq, which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq and is broadcast to Iraq.
Now I'm going to move on to another project I did.
Now I'm going to move on to another project I did.
It's titled "The Innocents."
And for the men in these photographs, photography had been used to create a fantasy.
Troy's picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward, but said he looked too old.
The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb from four years earlier, which they entered into a photo array days later, and he was positively identified.
Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait.
You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another.
And no matter what country you live or work in, you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of, even in their most ordinariness.
Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies.
They must navigate markets daily, making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens, to move their way through society, and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family, they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.
And so we need both the market and we need aid.
Patient capital works between, and tries to take the best of both.
Patient capital works between, and tries to take the best of both.
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives.
Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk, a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment, to use the market as the best listening device that we have, and the expectation of below-market returns, but outsized social impact.
And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves, because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have.
And he used three fundamental principles.
The first one was miniaturization.

The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
Second, it had to be extremely affordable.
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest, or else they wouldn't take the risk.
Now maybe this is what the map of the region might look like in 10 to 20 years.
But hold on. This map is 700 years old.
This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty, led by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.
What I want to present to you is what I call state building, day by day.
Let's start with Iraq.
Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.
Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.
Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together; now it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration.
The reason is Kurdistan.
And we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.
Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked.
It has no choice but to behave.
Fortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources were discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.
Now I know some of you may be thinking, "Oil, oil, oil.
Why is it all he's talking about is oil?"
Why is it all he's talking about is oil?"
Well, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we're talking about it now.
Before it was, how do we control their oil?
Well, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we're talking about it now.
Before it was, how do we control their oil?
Now it's their oil for their own purposes.
So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.
What is the lesson from all of this?
Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.
With innovations like the Great Western, we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.
So somehow, we went from this to this.
Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world, to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses working on small things.
And as we see this reemergence of design thinking and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems, there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful.
And I'd like to talk about some of those just for the next few minutes.
The first of those is that design is human-centered.
Hilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater, and Hugo Manassei of Participle have taken this idea of participation, and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0, they are suggesting a framework for reinventing the welfare state.
So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle, they worked with residents in Southwark, South London and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks.
Designs were refined and developed with 150 older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year.
Sometimes it comes in a positive version -- "Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself."
And equally important is the negative version -- "Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you."
Look into your own heart, discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever, to inflict that pain on anybody else.
And I intend to work on this till my dying day.
And I want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educate and stimulate compassionate thinking.
Education because we've so dropped out of compassion.
Education because we've so dropped out of compassion.
People often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody.
But of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it.
Because I've noticed a very small symmetry in the profile of one of the planet host stars.
And I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star, which is an indication that this star has swallowed a planet.
Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope of Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.
A star is the most simple object.
In the core, we have thermonuclear reactions going on, creating chemical elements.
And we have a cool atmosphere.


I run a design studio in New York.
It's not quite finished yet.
And I think by the time this lamp came about,  I had finally made peace with those dogs.
Then there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table.
I've found that finding out about what I'm going to like in the future, my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it.
When I had the idea of doing one, the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book.
And then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.
Which I understood after I translated it from architecture speech in to regular English, basically as logo making.
And I understood that the building itself was a logo.
So then it became quite easy.
But I did feel that I spent so much time learning this language, why do I only promote with it?
There must be something else.
And the whole series of work came out of it.
So we got brand new ones, shiny ones, medium ones, and very old, dark ones.
And with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week, created this fairly floral typography that spelled, "Obsessions make my life worse and my work better."
And the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between, "Should I really take as much money as I can?

Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?"

We used to cook; now we just add water, or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.
We just read the back of a label on a packet.
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.
We just read the back of a label on a packet.
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.
We just read the back of a label on a packet.
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.
So instead of trusting it, we fear it.
This is basically bringing the whole thing together.
And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto.
It's a greenhouse, where kids get told all about food and growing their own food.
We need to be thinking more about permaculture, which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.
It's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives.
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.
It's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives.
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.
It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."
Now here is what happened to this person who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.
He went from being alive and passionate at Stage One -- remember, "Life sucks, despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" -- to walking into a Boys and Girls Club, folding his arms, sitting down in a chair, and saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.
I don't know anybody.
They extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them, not just to myself, so that my following is greater, but I connect people who don't know each other to something greater than themselves.
And ultimately that adds to their values.
But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four, which is great, to Stage Five?
And one must admire the imagination of John Locke.
But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling African stories in the West: A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives, of difference, of darkness, of people who, in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling, are "half devil, half child."
And so, I began to realize that my American roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story, as had a professor, who once told me that my novel was not "authentically African."
I had bought into the single story of Mexicans and I could not have been more ashamed of myself.
So that is how to create a single story, show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become.
It is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power.
So that is how to create a single story, show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become.
It is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power.
There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world, and it is "nkali."
There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world, and it is "nkali."
It's a noun that loosely translates to "to be greater than another."
Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined by the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they're told, how many stories are told, are really dependent on power.
But there are other stories that are not about catastrophe, and it is very important, it is just as important, to talk about them.
I've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person.
The consequence of the single story is this: It robs people of dignity.
I've always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person.

It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult.
And she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel.
I was not only charmed, I was very moved.
Here was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians, who were not supposed to be readers.
What if my roommate knew about Nollywood, full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds, films so popular that they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they produce?
What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider, who has just started her own business selling hair extensions?
Or about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail, but continue to nurse ambition?
We're going to look at it for about 30 seconds, which is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk.
But I really want you to learn.
And I'll tell you -- don't look anywhere else -- I'll tell you what's happening in your head.
But I really want you to learn.
And I'll tell you -- don't look anywhere else -- I'll tell you what's happening in your head.
Your brain is learning, and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination; the left side of its visual field is under green illumination.
Notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite: one very white and one very dark, right?
Whereas on the right, the two tiles look nearly the same.
And yet there is still one on a dark surround, and one on a light surround. Why?
Don't believe me? Let's watch it again.
What's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion.
So, here we have -- let's turn this around -- a diamond.
What's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion.
So, here we have -- let's turn this around -- a diamond.
And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to hold it here, and I'm going to spin it.
And for all of you, you'll see it probably spinning this direction.
Now I want you to keep looking at it.

And suddenly it will flip, and start spinning the opposite direction.
Yes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?

Keep blinking. Every time you blink, it will switch.
So, illusions are often used, especially in art, in the words of a more contemporary artist, "to demonstrate the fragility of our senses."
Okay, this is complete rubbish.
The senses aren't fragile. And if they were, we wouldn't be here.
Okay, this is complete rubbish.
The senses aren't fragile. And if they were, we wouldn't be here.
Instead, color tells us something completely different, that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is.
But some were for working, some were for playing, some were for guys to collect their things.
Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.
Take this place for example.
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.
This is in Long Island, New York.
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.
This is in Long Island, New York.
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.
On the inside it's a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house.
He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics, and he trains in this space. He trains other people.
And right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments, which is another sort of important part about a manspace.
So, while this space represents someone's profession, this one certainly represents a passion.
And over the last decade, I traveled to over 40 countries to see jaguars and bears and elephants and tigers and rhinos.
But every time I would return from my trips I'd return back to New York City.
And on my weekends I would go up, just like all the other tourists, to the top of the Empire State Building, and I'd look down on this landscape, on these ecosystems, and I'd wonder, "How does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals?
And it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights to Jeffrey's Hook, where the George Washington Bridge goes across today.
Or this painting, from the 1740s, from Greenwich Village.
Those are two students at King's College -- later Columbia University -- sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.
What's that palm tree doing there?
So, it was in the course of these investigations that I ran into a map.
And it's this map you see here.
And it's this map you see here.
It's held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in.
This map isn't from Hudson's time, but from the American Revolution, 170 years later, made by British military cartographers during the occupation of New York City.
It's held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in.
This map isn't from Hudson's time, but from the American Revolution, 170 years later, made by British military cartographers during the occupation of New York City.
And it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew.
Here is Times Square, the two streams that came together to make a wetland in Times Square, as it was at the end of the American Revolution.
So I saw this remarkable map in a book.
And I thought to myself, "You know, if I could georeference this map, if I could place this map in the grid of the city today, I could find these lost features of the city, in the block-by-block geography that people know, the geography of where people go to work, and where they go to live, and where they like to eat."
And I'd just like, if you would give him a hand, to call out for his fine work.
There is such power in bringing science and visualization together, that we can create images like this, perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass.
And even though I've only had a brief time to speak, I hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place.

The place that you see here on the left side was interconnected. It was based on this diversity.
And it sees multiple people in a scene, remembers where individual people are, and looks from person to person, remembering people.
So, we're involving two things.
One, the perception of people, and two, the natural interface, the natural form of the interface, so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot.
And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you.
And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing, which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence.
And we're getting this mass-manufactured.

We specked it out to actually be doable with a very, very low-cost bill of materials, so that it can become a childhood companion for kids.
This is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man, I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister that pays all the bills.
It's held every two years in Burma.
And I particularly remember a really good speech by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.
The question was given to a bunch of engineers, about 15 years ago, "How do we make the journey to Paris better?"
And they came up with a very good engineering solution, which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from London to the coast, and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.
Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...
They are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing."
There are even records of people being executed for refusing to grow potatoes.
So he tried plan B.
This is mobile food. British are very good at that.
Fish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty, the pie, the sandwich.
We invented the whole lot of them.
He actually invented the toasty. But then, the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name.
Finally, we have contextual communication.
Now, the reason I show you Pernod -- it's only one example.

There are three important reasons.
The first is, it's essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society, and I think that it is a key step in evolution.
The second reason is, we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever, and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model.
Now, this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries.
But, for the first time, we can actually address this, with brain simulation, and ask very systematic and rigorous questions, whether this theory could possibly be true.
The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers.
It runs out of space.
And so what we do is we compare the buildings within our perceptual bubble, and we make a decision.
We make a decision it's that big, even though it's not that big.
They are confused, and you cannot make a decision.
So, while you're trying to make up your mind what the doctor, the surgeon, is doing while he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone.
He's at home having tea.
Now, we can speculate and philosophize this, but we don't actually have to for the next hundred years.
We can ask a very concrete question.
"Can the brain build such a perception?"
We can ask a very concrete question.
"Can the brain build such a perception?"
Is it capable of doing it?
Does it have the substance to do it?
And that's what I'm going to describe to you today.
So, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain.
And that's what I'm going to describe to you today.
So, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain.
It had to improve it a little bit.
And a synapse is a chemical location where they communicate with each other.
And these synapses together form the network or the circuit of the brain.
Now, the circuit, you could also think of as the fabric of the brain.
But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not.
So, the fabric of the brain, even though your brain may be smaller, bigger, it may have different types of neurons, different morphologies of neurons, we actually do share the same fabric.
And we think this is species-specific, which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species.

And we think this is species-specific, which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species.
So, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do is you have to make this come alive.
Now, when you look at that the first time, you think, "My god. How is reality coming out of that?"
But, in fact, you can start, even though we haven't trained this neocortical column to create a specific reality.
But we can ask, "Where is the rose?"

Where is it inside the neocortex?


Over the next five minutes, my intention is to transform your relationship with sound.
At last we've got some science we can apply.
And we're in the business of designing soundscapes.
Just a word on music. Music is the most powerful sound there is, often inappropriately deployed.
And then they did a recent report I thought was fascinating.
They actually started, in certain communities in the United States, start to publish people's electricity usage.
And what they found out is when that was available for public record, the people's electricity usage in those communities dropped.
This plus the fact that you've got phenomenal work from CEOs from Ford to Zappos, connecting on Twitter, creating an open environment, allowing their employees to be part of the process, rather than hidden behind walls.
You see this rising force in sort of total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt, all because the consumer is demanding it.
So, when we look at this and we step back, what I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real.
And what I'm going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face, using some computer graphics technology we've developed, and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics.
And we're going to try to do a photo-real face of an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there.
And that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face.
And, even more importantly, since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture, we can shoot Emily in just part of an afternoon, in many different facial poses and facial expressions.
So, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around.
And these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character.
Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.
In addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry, since it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face.
And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination, the red and the green and the blue, diffuse the light differently, we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer.
So you could go out to the world and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want, and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work.
Let's look at the first video.
I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.
You're not really given any instructions, but the forces of the process itself keep you in place.
That's what he does.
The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.
But will this only be available for the super rich, for those that can afford it? Are we headed for a new eugenics?
Will only those that are able to afford it be able to be this super race of the future?
So the big question for us is, "How do we manage this technological change?"
These will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West.
The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper type of new pyramids that will take place in China and in many other countries.
So forget about retirements if you're young.
These were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did discover all those things.
But that ability to make progress remained almost unused, until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe.
Or so we should hope.
And they don't perceive even those as what they really are, namely electrical crackles.
So we perceive nothing as what it really is.
Our connection to reality is never just perception.
Our connection to reality is never just perception.
It's always, as Karl Popper put it, theory-laden.
Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything.
And each year, she is magically compelled to return.
And her mother, Demeter, Goddess of the Earth, is sad, and makes it cold and barren.
That myth is testable.
If they'd been observed in phase, the theory would have been refuted.
But now, the fact that it's also a good explanation, hard to vary, makes the crucial difference.
If the ancient Greeks had found out about seasons in Australia, they could have easily varied their myth to predict that.
If the ancient Greeks had found out about seasons in Australia, they could have easily varied their myth to predict that.
For instance, when Demeter is upset, she banishes heat from her vicinity, into the other hemisphere, where it makes summer.
So, being proved wrong by observation, and changing their theory accordingly, still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks one jot closer to understanding seasons, because their explanation was bad: easy to vary.
All of this effort results in an inert object.
And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities.
This is not sustainable.
Now all this is -- and it's magic -- is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.
And it has no DNA.
This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living.
And it has no DNA.

It can follow chemical gradients.
Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.
Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.
This is a violent process.
And if you look even closer, you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other.
And then they are fossilized over millions of years.
Now a block of limestone, in itself, isn't particularly that interesting.
But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere.
Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide.
Would it give this block of limestone new properties?
Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide.
Would it give this block of limestone new properties?
Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.
So we've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we're working with to sustainably reclaim Venice.
And architect Christian Kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city.
So, here is the technology we have today.
So that these don't just exist as one entity, we kind of chemically engineer them.
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically, around the foundations of Venice, effectively petrifying it.
Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.
It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.
But gradually, as the buildings are repaired, we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.
Also it will attract the local marine ecology, who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.
So, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way.
But perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.
But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets.
So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.
But if you ever meet one, engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.
Maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed.
But contained inside those documents was a new language, a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science -- namely symmetry.
Now, symmetry is almost nature's language.
In microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object, because they are generally rather nasty.
The swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object.
And it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well.
Or what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.
To be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles we might see there, it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape in a higher dimensional space.
And I think Galileo summed up, very nicely, the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us.
Artists too love to play around with symmetry.
They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it.
Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in "The Magic Mountain."
Can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the Alhambra?
And it was Galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions.
For Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann, which was something still and deathly -- for Galois, symmetry was all about motion.

And it was Galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions.
For Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann, which was something still and deathly -- for Galois, symmetry was all about motion.
So I'm going to take you through, perhaps push you a little bit mathematically -- so brace yourselves -- push you a little bit to understand how this language works, which enables us to capture what is symmetry.
So, let's take these two symmetrical objects here.
Let's take the twisted six-pointed starfish.
So, let's take these two symmetrical objects here.
Let's take the twisted six-pointed starfish.
What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?

Let's take the twisted six-pointed starfish.
What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?
Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn, and still it looks like it did before I started.
What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?
Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn, and still it looks like it did before I started.
I could rotate it by a third of a turn, or a half a turn, or put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn.
Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn, and still it looks like it did before I started.
I could rotate it by a third of a turn, or a half a turn, or put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn.
And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn.
And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn.
And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before I started.
Now, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry.
And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before I started.
Now, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry.
Can anybody think what else I could do to this which would leave it like I did before I started?
Now, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry.
Can anybody think what else I could do to this which would leave it like I did before I started?
I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I?
Can anybody think what else I could do to this which would leave it like I did before I started?
I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I?
It's got no reflective symmetry.
Can anybody think what else I could do to this which would leave it like I did before I started?
I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I?
It's got no reflective symmetry.
And what about the triangle?
Well, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise or a third of a turn anticlockwise.
But now this has some reflectional symmetry.
Well, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise or a third of a turn anticlockwise.
But now this has some reflectional symmetry.
I can reflect it in the line through X, or the line through Y, or the line through Z.
I can reflect it in the line through X, or the line through Y, or the line through Z.
Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry where I just pick it up and leave it where it is.
So both of these objects have six symmetries.
Now, let's do it in a different order.
Let's do the reflection in X first, followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise.
The combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different.
And this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects -- they both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say they have the same symmetries?
But the way the symmetries interact enable us -- we've now got a language to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different.
And you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on.
Now, this power of the language is even more, because Galois can say, "Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries on the walls in the Alhambra?"
And it turns out they almost did.
You can prove, using Galois' language, there are actually only 17 different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra.
And that's where I work. I create mathematical objects, symmetrical objects, using Galois' language, in very high dimensional spaces.
So I think it's a great example of things unseen, which the power of mathematical language allows you to create.
So, like Galois, I stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you, and I've got a picture of it here.
Now, people like getting their names on things, on craters on the moon or new species of animals.
So I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object which hasn't been named before.
And this thing -- species die away, and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode -- but this mathematical object will live forever.
There had to be limits to all things.
The rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl.
If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.
And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion, which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.
This idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God, who is ultimately the compassionate one.
What does this compassion entail?
This idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God, who is ultimately the compassionate one.
What does this compassion entail?
It entails understanding the pain of the other.
Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven.
What does it mean, "dough becomes leaven"?
It means it gets filled with hot air.
Takes the bread and goes home.
Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself, "I'm an idiot. God wants bread?
God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"
God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"
He rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."
He goes in there, and it's not there.
This went on for years.
Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins, with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark.
Every week, the cleaner would come. "God you've answered my plea again."

A human child is born, and for quite a long time is a consumer.

As the child grows, it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust.

As the child grows, it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust.
It doesn't know even the word "violation."
Therefore, it has to blame itself, a wordless blame, which is more difficult to really resolve -- the wordless self-blame.
To be compassionate is not a joke.
It's not that simple.
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.
That's human heart.
No human heart is denied of that empathy.
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.
That's human heart.

Compassion is not defined in one form.
There's no Indian compassion.
There's no American compassion.

There's no American compassion.

There's no American compassion.

It's experienced by people occasionally.
But the extension of the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.
You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.
There's no choice in this: that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you, cannot be minus you.
Then everything becomes meaningful.
I have no more reason to blame myself.
If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many.
You act compassionately.
But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?
That is where you fake.
But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?
That is where you fake.
You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.
That's what the celebration is all about.
It's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community."
So, we sucked up.
I see pictures, and something says, "Now, that's compassion."
A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners, reminding me of the Hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest, but you must always leave some on the edges, just in case there's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture.
Talk about a picture of compassion.
I know how you feel."
And he said, "I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did.
I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while, and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world, and we can do that together."
And he said, "I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did.
I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while, and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world, and we can do that together."
That's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.
He asked them to give a message, and they each read in their own language a central affirmation, and that was some version of the golden rule: "As you would that others would do unto you, do also unto them."
Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message.
We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself.
Or, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks, "Some people preach the Gospel.
I have to tangibilitate the Gospel."
So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?
I have to tangibilitate the Gospel."
So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?
How do you make it real?
Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic.
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family, that family together that understands the nature of our unity.
We are one people together.
It is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions.
Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism, the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path.
When he says, "I am the spirit, and I am the way," and when the prophet Muhammad said, "Whoever has seen me has seen God," it is because they became so much an instrument of God, they became part of God's team -- so that God's will was manifest through them, and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos.
You are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live, and for whose purpose we shall die, and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings."
Our message today, and our purpose today, and those of you who are here today, and the purpose of this charter of compassion, is to remind.
For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other, because the knowledge of truth is within every human being.
Another three years, no vision. He leaves again.
This time, he comes down.
And as he's leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge.
So he said, "All right. I get the point." He went back.
Another three years.
Again, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.
And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right to see any encouraging vision.
And he comes to the town. He's a broken person.
And there, in the town, he's approached by a dog who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries, even in America, I think, in some areas -- and he's looking just terrible.
That's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha, no Maitreya, and everything is all hopeless.
And now I'm going to kill the maggots?"
So, he had a brilliant idea.
And there, the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor.
Again, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past, but from a biologist's point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self-serving too.
It's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion.
If there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do, politicians, religious leaders, and us, it would be what I call "expanding the moral imagination" -- that is to say, your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances.
This is not the same as compassion, but it's conducive to compassion. It opens the channels for compassion.
And I'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story, which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature.
It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane.
And because it's so much stuff, it's really important for the atmospheric system.
Because it's important to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing.
And as you come around the banks in these valleys, the forces can get up to two Gs.
And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they're on board.
So, as you can imagine, the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation.
So, I am very interested, from the beginning, how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures, and how we use these objects, can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world.
Rather than using a keyboard and mouse, why can I not use my computer in the same way that I interact in the physical world?
So, I started this exploration around eight years back, and it literally started with a mouse on my desk.
I thought, "Why can I not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world?"
A message written on a sticky note to my mom, on paper, can come to an SMS, or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar -- a to-do list that automatically syncs with you.
But you can also search in the digital world, or maybe you can write a query, saying, "What is Dr. Smith's address?"
So, I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions, but they can actually draw, so that it's more intuitive to use that way.
Then I thought, "Why not make a Google Map, but in the physical world?"
Rather than typing a keyword to find something, I put my objects on top of it.
PM: And you can of course play games.
Here, the camera is actually understanding how you're holding the paper and playing a car-racing game.
Many of you already must have thought, OK, you can browse.
Every culture is trying to understand itself: "Why do we exist?"
And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life, its own customized version of mythology.
Culture is a reaction to nature, and this understanding of our ancestors is transmitted generation from generation in the form of stories, symbols and rituals, which are always indifferent to rationality.
It's pointless."
And Alexander thought, "Why is he sitting around, doing nothing?
What a waste of a life."
And I believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired Indian mathematicians to discover the number zero.
Who knows?
And that brings us to the mythology of business.
It's not about compliance. It's about setting, getting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules -- just look at your Indian people around here, you'll see them smile; they know what it is.
And then look at people who have done business in India, you'll see the exasperation on their faces.
You see, this is what India is today. The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view.
So, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said, "All I want to do is align belief."
Sounds so simple.
But belief is not measurable.
He realizes that to succeed, he does not have to be a "professional," he does not have to cut out his emotions, he has to include all these people in his world to succeed, to make them happy, to make the boss happy, to make everyone happy.
The customer is happy, because the customer is God.
That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters, behavior will happen, business will happen.
So, what do they do?
They drink the water they know is dirty, they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice and they die.
And governments have not been able to provide clean water.
It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside, when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide.
Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work, and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh, dear.
And as for outsiders, white, black or brown, tar and feather them, and whip them out of town.

It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean.
In fact, the American publishers of my book, "The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone," added a gratuitous subtitle saying, "India: The next 21st-century power."
And I just don't think that's what India's all about, or should be all about.
Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic.
You know, when I grew up in India, telephones were a rarity.
In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines as a favor to those they deemed worthy.
If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.
Or you could pay eight times the going rate for something called a lightning call.
But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days, so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.
In fact, so woeful was our telephone service that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.
He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free, and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood, to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.
The other day I was in Kerala, my home state, at the country farm of a friend, about 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban.
And it was a hot day and he said, "Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?"
And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine, "Tulsi Zindabad": "Long live Tulsi."
That's soft power. And that is what India is developing through the "E" part of TED: its own entertainment industry.
The same is true, of course -- we don't have time for too many more examples -- but it's true of our music, of our dance, of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.
It was essentially India being itself.
And ultimately, it seems to me, that always works better than propaganda.
Governments aren't very good at telling stories.
But, the whole point is that India is the nationalism of an idea.
It's the idea of an ever-ever-land, emerging from an ancient civilization, united by a shared history, but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.
That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.
That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.
And it's the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed, color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter, and still rally around a consensus.
And the consensus is of a very simple principle, that in a diverse plural democracy like India you don't really have to agree on everything all the time, so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree.

One morning, in the year 1957, the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield saw himself like this, a weird freak with huge hands, huge mouth, and a tiny bottom.
Actually this creature is the result of the Penfield research.

He named it homunculus.
He named it homunculus.
Basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain.
So, of course, homunculus is definitely not a freak.
Basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain.
So, of course, homunculus is definitely not a freak.
It's you. It's me.
It's our invisible reality.
This visualization could explain, for example, why newborns, or smokers, put, instinctively, their fingers in the mouth.
Unfortunately it doesn't explain why so many designers remain mainly interested in designing chairs.
So anyway, even if I do not understand science entirely, for my design I essentially refer to it.
I'm fascinated by its ability to deeply investigate the human being, its way of working, its way of feeling.
And it really helps me to understand how we see, how we hear, how we breathe, how our brain can inform or mislead us.
The white noise is the sum of all frequencies that are audible by the human being, brought to the same intensity.
And this noise is like a "shhhhhhhhhhhhh," like that.
And this noise is the most neutral.
You feel the effect of the white noise?
It's too in silence.
If you make some noise you can feel the effect.
And this object will be able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day, and able to give you the quantity of light you need.
This object is completely covered by fiber opticals.
And the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object, for sure, but creates the idea of an eye sensibility of the object.
But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient.
This is, the kids will feel the therapeutic object needs him.
So the idea is, all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself, including air and molecules, for sure.
In this guise of living object approach, I like the idea of a kind of invisible design, as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field just around the objects themselves.
We could talk about a kind of soul, of a ghost accompanying them.
And almost a kind of poltergeist effect.
Because it is a kind of object with a conscience, able to be modified by its surroundings, and able to modify it as well.
The other great influence is the mine's canary.
In coal mines, this canary was supposed to be close to the miners.
So the principle of this object is to create an ecosystem called aquaponics.
And the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish, by a water pump, feeds the plants above.
And the plants will filter, by the roots, the dirty water of the fish.
And the plants will filter, by the roots, the dirty water of the fish.
After, it goes back into the fish tank.
After that you have two options.
How would you do it?
Well, the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe.
So, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.

It was the world's first popular computer.
But there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod you can tell -- or your iPhone, you can tell exactly what the time is, with precision.
The way little Lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky.
He would know where things would fit in the sky.

He would not only know what time it was, he would also know where the sun would rise, and how it would move across the sky.
But in St. John's, I was in the lower quarter.
And the fact was that Indian students studied harder than we did in Sweden.
They read the textbook twice, or three times or four times.
And I don't mean the whole economy, because to grow an economy of India to the size of U.K. -- that's a piece of cake, with one billion people.
But I want to see when will the average pay, the money for each person, per month, in India and China, when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States?
But I will start with a historical background.
And both countries had the better health, but still a very low economy.
And we came to 1978, and Mao Tse Tung died, and a new guy turned up from the left.
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here.
Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us.
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.
But I want to tell you a different story here today.
"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain, that partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance."
And one of the ways I like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels, and people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy, or a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.
We had stories like "The Seven-League Boots": the giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on, with every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles, a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal.
And it is something which has several characteristics.
It's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly.
It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it.
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies.
This is Lewes in Sussex, who have recently launched the Lewes Pound, a currency that you can only spend within the town, as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.

So the question I'd like to leave you with, really, is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive, how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions, while also building resilience?
Personally, I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil.
I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.

I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.
But let us honor what it has bought us, and move forward from this point.
In our accelerated media culture, desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines.
It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina: too few crying children and smashed up houses.
And yet desertification is a major threat on all continents, affecting some 110 countries and about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands.
The dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year.
That's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land, physically pushing people away from their homes.
Here I am -- I'm the second person on the left --  with the elders in Gidan-Kara, a tiny village outside of Sokoto.
But, one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood.
Now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they won't get chopped down.
This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things.

This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things.
It adds roughness to the dune's surface, to the texture of the dune's surface, binding the grains.
So, what is a black hole?
Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object, because there are only three characteristics that you can describe: the mass, the spin, and the charge.
And I'm going to only talk about the mass.
Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object, because there are only three characteristics that you can describe: the mass, the spin, and the charge.
And I'm going to only talk about the mass.
So, in that sense, it's a very simple object.
But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see, and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius.
And that's named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius.
This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.
And that's named after the guy who recognized why it was such an important radius.
This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.
So why is it so important?
And then it's a black hole.
So, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube, it would become a black hole, because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.
Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.
So, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube, it would become a black hole, because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.
Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.
And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.
It depends only on the mass of the object.
Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.
It depends only on the mass of the object.
Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.
Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole; I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.
So, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is, as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.
An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star's life.
But it's a kind of indirect argument.
Nonetheless, it's given rise to the notion that maybe it's not just these prima donnas that have these supermassive black holes, but rather all galaxies might harbor these supermassive black holes at their centers.
And if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy; what we see is the star light.
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.
So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.
And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used the world's largest telescope.
Now, this is wonderful, because the campaign promise of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope, the smaller the detail that we can see.
But it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.
And that is because of the atmosphere.
So, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years, and we see the stars go all the way around.
Now, most astronomers have a favorite star, and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.
Absolutely my favorite star in the world.
Likewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars, they just should not be there.
A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.
To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.
To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.
And it's a very fragile entity.
And what does the big black hole do?
And it's a very fragile entity.
And what does the big black hole do?
It strips that gas cloud apart.
And this is all big raised platform.
You can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment, and there is a slope.
Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms, but here they will care properly.

Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms, but here they will care properly.
And the water will go where it should go.
You can calculate the price of that water.
It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.
You can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.
You can see person coming up with two canisters of water.
And the water level -- these are not empty canisters -- water level is right up to this.
It can envy many municipalities, the color, the taste, the purity of this water.
But we will come back, once again, to the traditional thing.
So, water from 300, 400 kilometers away, soon it become like this.
In many portions, water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything.
And this is the 16 centimeter area.
Such a limited rainfall, and highest colorful life flourished in these areas.
You won't find water in this slide.
You won't find water in this slide.
But it is invisible.
Somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here.
Whether water level goes up or down, the beauty is there throughout.
Another water body, dried up, of course, during the summer period, but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart.
These statues, marvelous statues, gives you an idea of water table.
Another small water body, called the [unclear].
It is difficult to translate in English, especially in my English.
But the nearest would be "glory," a reputation.
The reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up.
In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up.
And perhaps they knew the future also.
In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up.
And perhaps they knew the future also.
It was designed some 150 years ago.
And you have to go further down.
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words, so we can say a thousand words right now, an another thousand words.
If the water table goes down, you will find new stairs.
I thought this was a great assignment.
And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it.
I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet that's been folded just once.
This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design besides Rubik's cube.
So, here we have a crowded parking lot with cars all over the place.
The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle.
I didn't know it coming into it.
And the only reason I really know that is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright, and that was six months after he'd had a stroke.
And he had never appeared in public since that point.
She wasn't about to make up for this occasion.
And she was sitting there surrounded by books, and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will, which she had by her side.
She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned.
And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis, and then prescribes a line of treatment, and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site, usually under a tree.
But they get glasses in the frames of their choice, and that's very important because I think glasses, in addition to helping people see, is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.
So they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surgery, are counseled, and then there are buses waiting, which will transport them to the base hospital.
But it's not about fire and brimstone either.
Its videos are intended to show a kinder, gentler face of Islam, for young people to deal with life's challenges.
Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd.
Now, "The 99" is not just a comic book.
It's now a theme park.
There is an animated series in the works.
The political vision of a terrorist organization is decided by the leadership, which, generally, is never more than five to seven people.
All the others do, day in and day out, is search for money.
Once, for example, I was interviewing this part-timer from the Red Brigades.
The commander told me that a woman could gauge a potentially violent situation much better than men.
And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively.
This man was very drunk, and he was very interested in my camera, until he noticed the women, who handled him with smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course.
Over the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested.
And I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy, and my own faith in humanity.
However, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel.
Now, monsoon, the root of the word "monsoon" comes from the word "season."
So, it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia.
And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.
And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.
Hot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it.
And the way it works is, it comes from the southwest.
They are very good fliers, but they don't go too far.
But this guy is an exception.
And this is called the Globe Skimmer, or Wandering Glider.

But it really hasn't been studied very much.
It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly.
If you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones, like that red one. Or the really rare ones, the endemic endangered ones.
This is, it seems a bit dull you know.
Average height, about that much above sea level.
So, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue.
But I'm not going to talk about that.
So, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue.

Another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains, the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone.
You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place.
But in October, remember, we're still in southwest monsoon, Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon.
But wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west.
October, November, December. That is not the northeast monsoon season.
That's not the southwest season.
That's the inter-monsoon, the time when the monsoon changes.
And there is a front between them, and the front moves.
So, if you've got India here, when the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon.
Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon.
So, if you've got India here, when the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon.
Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon.
And that front in the middle is not vertical, it's at an angle.
And they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south they come down through Karnataka, into Kerala.
And then they run out of land.
But they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species, it can fly for thousands of kilometers.
And the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts.
The dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there.
When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.
Now metaphor is ubiquitous, yet it's hidden.
But you just have to look at the words around you and you'll find it.
Ralph Waldo Emerson described language as "fossil poetry."

The anger in me against corruption made me to make a big career change last year, becoming a full-time practicing lawyer.
My experiences over the last 18 months, as a lawyer, has seeded in me a new entrepreneurial idea, which I believe is indeed worth spreading.
And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower than the bribe demanded.
I believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a BPO kind of environment, and made available on web, call-center and franchise physical offices, for a fee, to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe.
The target market is as tempting as it can get.
And it is an absolutely virgin market.
I propose to explore this idea further, to examine the potential of creating a for-profit, fee-based BPO kind of service to stop bribes and prevent corruption.
I do realize that the fight for justice against corruption is never easy.
The battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves, our families, our friends, and even our kids.
Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place.
What gives us the courage?
And it's this reaction that we want to do.
There is one trickiness about this reaction.
Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees, but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.
Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees, but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.
It's pretty hot.
The trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn't exist in nature.
And lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line.
And we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water.
Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion.
Is it cost-competitive?
We make estimates of what we think it would cost to actually make a fusion power plant.
And we get within about the same price as current electricity.
And in fact we can make fusion happen.
And just down the road, this is JET.
It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion.
We changed completely our strategy.
And after 20 days we landed successfully in Egypt.
But if I show you this picture it's not to tell you how happy we were.
I just thought it's a dream and I want to do it.
And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington, together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh, with Apollo 11, with the Wright Brothers' Flyer, with Chuck Yeager's 61, I had really a thought then.
I thought, well, the 20th century, that was brilliant.
It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now.
So how can we perpetuate this pioneering spirit with something that will be independent from fossil energy?
And this is when the project Solar Impulse really started to turn in my head.
We have gone through the stages of simulation, design, computing, preparing the construction of the first prototype.
That has been achieved after two years of work.
Cockpit, propeller, engine.
That has been achieved after two years of work.
Cockpit, propeller, engine.
Just the fuselage here, it's so light.
Couple of kilos more for the wing spars.
This is the complete structure of the airplane.
And one month ago we have unveiled it.
If our airplane is too heavy, if the pilot wastes energy, we'll never make it through the night.
And in our world, if we keep on spoiling, wasting our energy resources, if we keep on building things that consume so much energy that most of the companies now go bankrupt, it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem.
So, you see that this airplane is more a symbol.
But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.
It can contemplate the meaning of infinity, ask questions about the meaning of its own existence, about the nature of God.
And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world.
So, here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something, but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something.
And this is truly astonishing.
Because it's as though this neuron is adopting the other person's point of view.
And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system, which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions.
So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group, say the use of fire, or a particular type of tool, instead of dying out, this spread rapidly, horizontally across the population, or was transmitted vertically, down the generations.
So, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian, instead of Darwinian.
So, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian, instead of Darwinian.
Darwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years.
A polar bear, to evolve a coat, will take thousands of generations, maybe 100,000 years.
I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner.
The first shot I ever did was of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know, so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it.
But the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day.
Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department of a department store, almost got escorted from the premises.
I live opposite a farm. And this was the runt of the litter, a piglet that died.
And what's really interesting is, if you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused.

And should that pig have grown, unfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead after I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway.
Now, how do I do this, and where do I do this, and all of that sort of thing.
This is my new, purpose-built, X-ray shed.
And the door to my X-ray room is made of lead and steel.
And when they do, I'm in the queue.
So, I like to use them.
The coloring, so coloring adds another level to the X-rays.
It's whatever takes my fancy, really.
It's not accurately colored to how it is in real life.
That flower doesn't come in bright orange, I don't think.
In my career I've had two exposures to radiation, which is two too many, because it stays with you for life.
It's cumulative.
It has human connotations.
It's cumulative.
It has human connotations.
The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize, but also it looks like it's a robot, and it comes from a sci-fi genus.
Now, that's a variety of things, from recently deceased bodies, to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers to train in taking X-rays of the human body, at different densities.
I have very high-tech equipment of gloves, scissors and a bucket.
I will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds, I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem.

Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.
Look at this monster.
Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.
Look at this monster.
It's so basic. It just grows wild.
Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.
Look at this monster.
It's so basic. It just grows wild.
And the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be.
Not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye, the way the leaves form. They're curling back on each other.
So the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners.
So, what am I doing in the future?
Well, this year is the 50th anniversary of Issigonis's Mini, which is one of my favorite cars.
So, I've taken it apart, component by component, months and months and months of work.
The problem is that we're not programmed for longevity.
We are programmed for something called procreative success.
I love that word.
More significant than what they eat is how they eat it.
They have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating, which, as you know, is a big problem here in America.
A few of the strategies we observed: they eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.
And typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair, or going down to Arizona to play golf.
In the Okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement.
Instead there is one word that imbues your entire life, and that word is "ikigai."
We're kind of like greedy kids, using it all up, aren't we?
And today is a time for me to talk to you about water.
It's not only because we like to drink lots of it, and its marvelous derivatives, beer, wine, etc.
My first experience with king cobras was in '72 at a magical place called Agumbe, in Karnataka, this state.
And it is a marvelous rain forest.
This first encounter was kind of like the Maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior.
It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off.
It has remarkable features.
Even though it grows to 20 feet long, since it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings.
Why? How could it happen?
This is a relatively clean river.
The Chambal, if you look at it, has clear water.
I got infected when I was 17, when, as a student of the design college, I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas, challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt, and how contagious that feeling was.
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.
It was time now to infect India.
So, on August 15th, again, Independence Day, 2009, empowered with the same process, we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."
L'Union Astronomique Internationale, for those of you who don't speak French.
I thought I'd translate for you.
From the rulebook: Nomenclature is a tool.
And within numbers, is there an underlying secret to the universe?
That is the premise of this particular presentation.
By the way, that's a natural picture of Saturn, no adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful.
But what they're seeing, way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background, is this kind of odd undulation.
It doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be.
So, you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture, so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like.
They are so different.
Look, ours is more red, it's longer.
They stole our flag! They stole our flag!"
Look, ours is more red, it's longer.
They stole our flag! They stole our flag!"
Bode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus.
The first is Bharti Kher.
The central motif of Bharti's practice is the ready-made store-bought bindi that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads, every day, in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage.
But originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world.
And that's what we did for this piece of muscle.
This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle.
We take the cells, we expand them, we place the cells on the scaffold, and we then place the scaffold back into the patient.

But actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient, we actually exercise it.
We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder.
We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells.
We coat the outside with these muscle cells.
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it.
This is actually a heart valve, which we engineered.
And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy.
We actually take donor organs, organs that are discarded, and we then can use very mild detergents to take all the cell elements out of these organs.
So, for example on the left panel, top panel, you see a liver.
We actually take the donor liver, we use very mild detergents, and we, by using these mild detergents, we take all the cells out of the liver.
If you present with a diseased wind pipe we'd like to take cells from your windpipe.
If you present with a diseased pancreas we'd like to take cells from that organ.
Why? Because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want.

A windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell.
You know, I just showed you this presentation, everything looks so good, everything works. Actually no, these technologies really are not that easy.
Some of the work you saw today was performed by over 700 researchers at our institute across a 20-year time span.
So, these are very tough technologies.
And eventually they had to freeze their organization into something called a bastardized thruscenium.
So, the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided, the ability to move between stage configurations, had better be able to be done without relying on operational costs. Alright? Affordably.
The architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb.
But based on the positions, they took the educated leap of faith to do so.
And effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine.
Now, that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time.
If you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the Ice Capades the next night, that would also be bad.
And so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms and allowed the theater and our client to actually do this with confidence that they would be able to change over their configurations at will.
The second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house.
You can bring large objects into the chamber itself.
But most convincingly when we had to confront the idea of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure, is something that is represented by this.
And again, this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built, but at least suggests the ideas.
Now, if there is anyone here from American Airlines, please consider doing your Christmas party here.
That allows the company to raise operational budgets without having to compete with other venues with much larger auditoriums.
That's an enormous benefit.
Here it is in a flat floor configuration.
The theater has been going through its kind of paces.
Here it is in an end stage configuration.
I'm very happy to be here in India.
And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last particularly 11 years with V-Day and "The Vagina Monologues," traveling the world, essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women.
What I want to talk about today is this particular cell, or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.
And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last particularly 11 years with V-Day and "The Vagina Monologues," traveling the world, essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women.
What I want to talk about today is this particular cell, or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.
And I want to call it the girl cell.
which was, by the way, patriarchy.
I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness.
And it is essential to balance, to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us.
And it is essential to balance, to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us.
And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion, and it's empathy, and it's passion itself, and it's vulnerability, and it's openness, and it's intensity, and it's association, and it's relationship, and it is intuitive.
And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom, and that vulnerability is our greatest strength, and that emotions have inherent logic, which lead to radical, appropriate, saving action.
Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him.
And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded of what he was doing.
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell.
And she was holding her baby.
And I asked her if she loved her baby.
And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said, "Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby?
And then we asked her, "Okay, what else do you need?"
And she said, "Well, now, I need a house."
So, seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house in Narok, Kenya, in the Masai land.
For me, that is the power of girls.
And that is the power of transformation.
I want to close today with a new piece from my book.
And that is the power of transformation.
I want to close today with a new piece from my book.
And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here.

And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here.
And I want to do it for Sunitha.
And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday, the girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else.
I know my father isn't coming back, and that no one's prepared for the fire.
I know that lipstick means more than show, and boys are super insecure, and so-called terrorists are made, not born.
I know that one kiss could take away all my decision-making ability.
Four million of these babies die annually.
But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe, long-term health problems.
The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life, its only job is to grow.
This is a phase-change material.
It's a wax-like substance with a melting point of human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius.
You can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time, after which you simply reheat the pouch.
I'll start with insulin, diabetes medication in the U.S.
OK, the American population.
On Medicaid -- if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid, or if you have health insurance -- insulin is pretty straightforward.
You get it, either in pill form or you get it as an injection; you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels.
Massive technological advance: took an incredibly deadly disease, made it solvable.
Adherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day?
So, think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake.
Just doesn't make sense.
Now, the model is intuitively right.
Just doesn't make sense.
Now, the model is intuitively right.
It just doesn't happen to be right about the world.
So, let's dial this back. That's what? Fifth grade? Fourth grade?
Let's go back to kindergarten. OK?
There's a great show on American television that you have to watch.
And they are trying to figure out, "Safety is good.
I want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety?"
"I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests."
The car swerves to avoid it, and therefore doesn't get into an accident.
BWM realizes safety, in people's minds, has two components.
You can be safe because when you're hit, you survive, or you can be safe because you avoid accidents.
Now, carrying this thing around is complicated.
You gotta carry the bottle, you gotta carry the syringe.
It's also painful.
You gotta carry the bottle, you gotta carry the syringe.
It's also painful.
Now, you may think to yourself, "Well, if my eyes depended on it, you know, I would obviously use it every day."
This is a pen, it's called an insulin pen, preloaded.
The needle is particularly sharp.
You just gotta carry this thing around.
Why? Because for free, this isn't a new technology, this is a letter -- we're getting a Big Bang in behavior.
So, how do we tackle the last mile?
I think this tells us there is an opportunity.
But you know what we need to combine it with?
We need to combine this with the scientific method.
See what's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile, to me, is that the first 999 miles are all about science.
This is a journal, PNAS -- I think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America.
You've seen multiple of these today, when everyone's bragging about the amazing things they've done.
This is a report about a drug called lithium.
You don't have the blinding, you don't have data, it doesn't follow the scientific method.
It's never going to work. You can't do it."
So, I said, "Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder."
But almost all the time it works.
It's actually scary. It's beautiful.
So, we couldn't run a clinical trial, we couldn't figure it out.
We asked our control algorithm, are those 69 patients -- by the way, you'll notice that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial -- can we look at those patients and say, "Can we match them with our time machine to the other patients that are just like them, and what happens?"
Even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly. Exactly.
Those little lines? That's the power.
How do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost? How do you do it?
Let me just give you two examples.
The rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world -- poor resources, a rigorous environment, a series of problems in lightweight, and things of this kind -- and also not so different from the home healthcare and diagnostic system world.
So, this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper.
Now, how simple can you make the production?
Why do we choose paper?
Now, how simple can you make the production?
Why do we choose paper?
There's an example of the same thing on a finger, showing you basically what it looks like.
It is printing. You put that on, you warm it a little bit, the wax prints through so it absorbs into the paper, and you end up with the device that you want.
The printers cost 800 bucks now.
They'll make, we estimate that if you were to run them 24 hours a day they'd make about 10 million tests a year.
Prick a finger, you get some blood, about 50 microliters.
That's about all you're going to get, because you can't use the usual sort of systems.
You can't manipulate it very well, although I'll show something about that in a moment.
What you do about something which requires quantitative analysis?
And so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there, and at this point there is a dramatic flourish, and out comes the universal solution to everything these days, which is a cell phone. In this particular case, a camera phone.
They're everywhere, six billion a month in India.
And if it's just papers and phys. rev. letters, we've got a problem.
Here is another example of something which is -- this is a little spectrophotometer.
It measures the absorption of light in a sample The neat thing about this is, you have light source that flickers on and off at about 1,000 hertz, another light source that detects that light at 1,000 hertz, and so you can run this system in broad daylight.

It performs about equivalently to a system that's in the order of 100,000 dollars.

This is the state-of-the-art and how we do it.
You know, I know very well, as a cancer doctor, I can't treat advanced cancer.
So, as an aside, I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early.
So, the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged.
Why is it a disease of the aged?
Because evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children.
So if you look at cancers, it is very rare -- extremely rare -- to have cancer in a child, on the order of thousands of cases a year.
As one gets older? Very, very common.
Why is it hard to treat?
As one gets older? Very, very common.
Why is it hard to treat?
Because it's heterogeneous, and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer.
Because it's heterogeneous, and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer.
It starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells, what we call clonal selection.
But, if we start to understand that cancer isn't just a molecular defect, it's something more, then we'll get to new ways of treating it, as I'll show you.
It's basically symptoms.
It's manifestations of a disease.
What's exciting is that over the last two or three years, the government has spent 400 million dollars, and they've allocated another billion dollars, to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project.
And I'll show you some data there where I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it.
The key is, when you look at these variables and you look at this data, you have to understand the data inputs.
You know, if I measured your temperature over 30 days, and I asked, "What was the average temperature?"
So, one of the problems, the fundamental problems in medicine is that you and I, and all of us, we go to our doctor once a year.
We have discrete data elements; we don't have a time function on them.
Earlier it was referred to this direct life device.
We have discrete data elements; we don't have a time function on them.
Earlier it was referred to this direct life device.
You know, I've been using it for two and a half months.
One of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer came out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine, where they took women who were pre-menopausal with breast cancer.
So, about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get.
They had gotten their chemotherapy, and then they randomized them, where half got placebo, and half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone.
She had three kids under the age of 12, and this is her CT scan.
And so what this is, is we're taking a cross-section of her body here, and you can see in the middle there is her heart, and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor that will invade and will kill her, untreated, in a matter of weeks.
She goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway, and again, I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system, in the cancer, but it targeted a pathway, and a month later, pow, that cancer's gone.
The amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial, where they gave half placebo and half the drug.
And we learned something important there.
What's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada, where it's "more ethical to give placebos."
TS: So something like this.
I'm doing this as a demo, and it's more playful, but inevitably, all of this can be used.
I can redeem this painting, just continuing on, doing layers upon layers.
You know, it seems at this stage in your life, you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant -- I suppose it's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your Parkinson's and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life.
Is that relevant to your work?
TS: As it turns out, this device kind of comes in handy, because I don't have to have the fine motor skills to do, that I can operate slides, which is more of a mental process.
You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces.
You think of yourself as the servant.
TS: Nature is -- well, it's a godsend.
In the meantime, I was chairing donor meetings, for instance, in which the various donors, and many of them like to be in Nairobi -- it is true, it is one of the unsafest cities of the world, but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable.
And in these donor meetings, I noticed that many of the worst projects -- which were put forward by our clients, by the governments, by promoters, many of them representing suppliers from the North -- that the worst projects were realized first.
Let me give you an example: a huge power project, 300 million dollars, to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful, areas of western Kenya.

Let me give you an example: a huge power project, 300 million dollars, to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful, areas of western Kenya.
And we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits: It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there, nobody was interested in irrigation projects.
And we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits: It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there, nobody was interested in irrigation projects.
To the contrary, we knew that this project would destroy the environment: It would destroy riparian forests, which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups, the Samburu and the Turkana in this area.
So everybody knew this is a, not a useless project, this is an absolute damaging, a terrible project -- not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars, and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools, like hospitals and so on.
I found out afterwards, after I left, under a big fight, the World Bank.
The reason was that the members of the World Bank thought that foreign bribery was okay, including Germany.
In Germany, foreign bribery was allowed.
We need a revolution.
Mexico, Australia, Germany, India, China, all have massive problems of obesity and bad health.
Think about smoking.
Pizza for breakfast. They don't even get crockery.
Knives and forks? No, they're too dangerous.
They have scissors in the classroom, but knives and forks? No.
Knives and forks? No, they're too dangerous.
They have scissors in the classroom, but knives and forks? No.
And the way I look at it is: If you don't have knives and forks in your school, you're purely endorsing, from a state level, fast food, because it's handheld.
JO: Immediately you get a really clear sense of "Do the kids know anything about where food comes from?"
Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear?
JO: What do you think this is? Child: I don't know.
For me, there isn't any need to flavor the milk.
Okay? There's sugar in everything.
I know the ins and outs of those ingredients.
Now, look, if we do all this stuff, and we can, it's so achievable. You can care and be commercial.
Absolutely.
But the home needs to start passing on cooking again, for sure.
Absolutely.
But the home needs to start passing on cooking again, for sure.
For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.
But the home needs to start passing on cooking again, for sure.
For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.
And for me, it's quite romantic, but it's about if one person teaches three people how to cook something, and they teach three of their mates, that only has to repeat itself 25 times, and that's the whole population of America.
Suddenly, all sorts of transport, travel information were possible, and this gave birth to, what I like to call, the bureaucratic age.
And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are.
Suddenly, you have the big, strong, central state.
Now, what does this mean for our politics, for our public services, for our government?
Well I can't, in the time I've got, give huge numbers of examples, but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change.
And this is so obvious, in a way, because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done.
But when he made that speech, what could you do to build the stronger, better society?
You could fight for your country, you could die for your country, you could serve in your country's civil service, but you didn't really have the information and the knowledge and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now.
And I think an even more wonderful speech, which I'm going to read a big chunk of, which sums up what I said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money, and more that we should try and measure than money.
And I think an even more wonderful speech, which I'm going to read a big chunk of, which sums up what I said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money, and more that we should try and measure than money.
And it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description of why gross national product captures so little: It "does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play.
It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate.

It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.
And one of the first things that I started to investigate was the history of the name of technology.
And in the United States there is a State of the Union address given by every president since 1790.
And each one of those is really kind of summing up the most important things for the United States at that time.
So, technology was sort of absent from everybody's thinking until 1952, which happened to be the year of my birth.
And obviously, technology had existed before then, but we weren't aware of it, and so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life.
I actually did research to find out the first use of the word "technology."

And grandparents are very important, because they are the transmitter of cultural evolution and information.
Imagine a world and basically everybody was 20 to 30 years old.
How much learning can you do?
So, long before the industrial age we've been affecting the planet on a global scale, with just a small amount of technology.
The other thing that the early man invented was fire.
And fire was used to clear out, and again, affected the ecology of grass and whole continents, and was used in cooking.

It enabled us to actually eat all kinds of things.
While this is something that comes from our mind, it also has its roots deeply into the cosmos.
It goes back. The origins and roots of technology go back to the Big Bang, in this way, in that they are part of this self-organizing thread that starts at the Big Bang and goes through galaxies and stars, into life, into us.
And the three major phases of the early universe was energy, when the dominant force was energy; then it became, the dominant force, as it cooled, became matter; and then, with the invention of life, four billion years ago, the dominant force in our neighborhood became information.
It's the increased order.
Where does this order come from? Its roots go way back.
We actually don't know.
It's a branching off from the human form.
But technology has its own agenda, like anything, like life itself.
For instance, right now, three-quarters of the energy that we use is actually used to feed the technium itself.
This is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power.
Your cat wants more food.
A bacterium, which has no consciousness at all, wants to move towards light.
Your cat wants more food.
A bacterium, which has no consciousness at all, wants to move towards light.
It has an urge, and technology has an urge.
He could buy things that King Henry, in all his wealth, could never buy.
That's what progress is about.
So, technology is selfish; technology is generous.
Right now the default position about when a new technology comes along, is we -- people talk about the precautionary principle, which is very common in Europe, which says, basically, "Don't do anything. When you meet a new technology, stop, until it can be proven that there's no harm."
I think that really leads nowhere.
But a better way is to, what I call proactionary principle, which is: You engage with technology.
You try it out.
You obviously do what the precautionary principle suggests, you try to anticipate it, but after anticipating it, you constantly asses it, not just once, but eternally.
And when it diverts from what you want, we prioritize risk, we evaluate not just the new stuff, but the old stuff.

And when it diverts from what you want, we prioritize risk, we evaluate not just the new stuff, but the old stuff.
We fix it, but most importantly, we relocate it.
So that I think technology loves biology, if we allow it to.
Great movement that is starting billions of years ago is moving through us and it continues to go, and our choice, so to speak, in technology, is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves.
So, technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket.

So, technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket.
It's more than just gadgets; it's more than just things that people invent.
It's very hard to measure because there are mixed motives.
Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes, and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong.
But reliable estimates range between 60 billion and 200 billion dollars per year.
We also surveyed that. Seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in America have been threatened by their students with violating their rights, with lawsuits by their students. They are threatening, their students.
It's not that they usually sue, it's not that they would win, but it's an indication of the corrosion of authority.
And how has this system of law worked for government?
In the areas that are regulated, there are so many rules no human could possibly know it.
Well how do you fix it? We could spend 10,000 lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle.
But the challenge here is not one of just amending the law, because the hurdle for success is trust.
People -- for law to be the platform for freedom, people have to trust it.
So, that's my second proposition: Trust is an essential condition to a free society.
Life is complicated enough without legal fear.
We have to migrate from all this complexity towards general principles and goals.
The constitution is only 16 pages long.
Worked pretty well for 200 years.

Law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices.

If they can't internalize it, they won't trust it.
If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom, to maintain order, everybody's learning suffers.
If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims, then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders.
If the environmental agency can't decide that the power lines are good for the environment, then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city.
In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs, all your vital signs: your heart rhythm, your blood pressure, your oxygen, your temperature, etc.
This is already available today.
This is AirStrip Technologies.
You can put it on for two weeks and send it in the mail.
Now, how does this work? Well, there is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors that one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist.
And this sends a signal and it creates a body area network to a gateway.
Now, how does this work? Well, there is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors that one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist.
And this sends a signal and it creates a body area network to a gateway.
Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway, as today many of these things are dedicated gateways, because they are not so well integrated.
That signal goes to the web, the cloud, and then it can be processed and sent anywhere: to a caregiver, to a physician, back to the patient, etc.
So, that's basically very simplistic technology of how this works.
Now, I have this device on.
So, that's basically very simplistic technology of how this works.
Now, I have this device on.
I didn't want to take my shirt off to show you, but I can tell you it's on.
It's like a wireless accelerometer, pedometer.
And I want to just give you the results of that testing, because I wanted to understand about the consumer movement.
I hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better -- I hope so.

But this monitors food, it monitors activity and tracks weight.
However you have to put in most of this stuff.
Eighty percent of Americans have chronic disease, or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have two or more chronic disease, 140 million Americans have one or more chronic disease, and 80 percent of our 1.5, whatever, trillion expenditures are related to chronic disease.
Now, diabetes is one of the big ones.
Almost 24 million people have diabetes.
Now, the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details.
OK, this is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters, or pick out the little letters, and the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly.
And the thing is, the normal brain ignores the details.
In fact, I loved the movie, how they duplicated all my projects. That's the geek side.
My drawings got to star in the movie too.
And actually it's called "Temple Grandin," not "Thinking In Pictures."
And then there's a verbal mind, they know every fact about everything.
Now, another thing is the sensory issues.
I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face.
As a new father, I have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are, what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child.
I would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for Darius, and for me to be told that there might be other Dariuses who are not getting treatment, that's just viscerally wrong.
So that's the personal reason.
And these two missions, as you can tell, thread together perfectly. One adds to the other; in fact, one would be impossible without the other.
So, to implement these twin missions, a few years ago, I launched Project Prakash.
Prakash, as many of you know, is the Sanskrit word for light, and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children, we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience.
But, every so often, we come across children who show some residual vision, and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treatable.
So, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital.
That's the hospital we're working with in Delhi, the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital.
So, here's what happens very soon after the onset of sight.
Here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago, and you see Ethan Myers, a graduate student from MIT, running the experiment with him.
His visual-motor coordination is quite poor, but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out.
Patient: A square and a circle.
PS: And we see this pattern over and over again.
The one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information.
The clinical implication, it comes from the domain of autism.
Visual integration has been associated with autism by several researchers.
When we saw that, we asked: Could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath, of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism?
The collectors, the friends, the press, everyone said, "Nice, but thank you."
"No thank you," was more like it.
But I wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut, because I was painting it from my gut.
It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want: It's got love, joy, happiness, sadness, tears, laughter, lots of deceit, intrigue.
And like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes.
And that's exactly what cricket has done.
You fought by day, then it was sunset, so everyone went back home.
And then you worked out your strategy, and you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again.
The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.

Princes patronize the game, not because they love the game, but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers.
But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket, which was, all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball, and any number of people could play it anywhere.

But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket, which was, all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball, and any number of people could play it anywhere.
Take a look: You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there, you could play it in a little alley -- you couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall; don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.
And then an enormous accident took place.
In Indian sport we don't make things happen, accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes.
And we won this World Cup in 1983.
So, it's a bit of a curve, that.
And then another big accident happened in our cricket.
England invented 20 overs cricket, and said, "The world must play 20 overs cricket."
A massive, massive success: India, the world TT champions.
Harsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket.
The accident, of course, there, was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast.
It was at a time when investment was coming in, India was feeling a little more confident about itself.
And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do.
And thankfully for all of us, the English are very good at inventing things, and then the gracious people that they are, they let the world become very good at it.
America is a home of leagues. And they said, "Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India."
But was India ready for it?
Because cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.
And so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived.
Everyone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to.
The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.
They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan.
And something very interesting happened.
We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.
Can you imagine, you've got the dollar on view and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.
There's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished, everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.
Right so, finally, an English game that India usurped a little bit, but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.
If you want to take the game around the world, it's got to be the shortest form of the game.
You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end, or you can't take it all over the world.
So that's what T20 is doing.
I was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with.
So, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid.
L'il C: I tell them to create a ball, and then you just use that ball of energy.

And instead of throwing it out, people would think that's a krump move, that's a krump move.
And instead of throwing it out, people would think that's a krump move, that's a krump move.
That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out, you throw it out, and you hold it.
And you let it go, and then right when you see the tail, you grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in.
I was not the only person editing the open street map.
Each flash on this visualization -- put together by ITO World -- shows an edit in 2009 made to the Open Street Map.
Let's now spin the world during the same year.
You can see Europe is ablaze with updates.
Some places, perhaps not as much as they should be.
Here focusing in on Haiti.
The map of Port au-Prince at the end of 2009 was not all it could be, not as good as the map of California.
Fortunately, just after the earthquake, GeoEye, a commercial company, released satellite imagery with a license, which allowed the open-source community to use it.
This is January, in time lapse, of people editing ... that's the earthquake.
is $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year.
Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year, just for that sign in each direction.
Discount that back to the present, at five percent: over two million dollars for a stop sign, in each direction.
And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.
So I'll take you through that and we'll see what it's like when someone really summons the will to survive.
OK, this is Mount Everest.
I remember one time being up near the summit, I reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle, inside my down jacket, only to discover that the water was already frozen solid.
That gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit.
OK, this is the route up Everest.
There were three other expeditions on the mountain, an American team, a New Zealand team and an IMAX team.
And, after actually two months of preparation, we built our camps all the way up the mountain.
This is a view looking up the icefall, the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp.
And, after actually two months of preparation, we built our camps all the way up the mountain.
This is a view looking up the icefall, the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp.
And here's a picture in the icefall; it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly, and it actually changes every day.
When you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze; you can't even see over the top.
This is near the top of the icefall.
You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.
This is a view taken from camp three.
You can see the Lhotse face is in profile, it's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it, so you put the camp halfway through.
If you notice, the summit of Everest is black.
He really said that.
So he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten.
You can see his hand is completely white; his face, his nose, is burned.
It just shows you what the power of the mind can do.
He was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients; luckily, we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys.
A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.
And here's the thing that should freak you out.
And that is that, when we lower the oxygen concentration further by 100 times, to 10 parts per million, they were not dead, they were in suspended animation, and we could bring them back to life without any harm.
And this precise oxygen concentration, 10 parts per million, that caused suspended animation, is conserved.
So, one time, I was at home watching television on the couch while my wife was putting our child to bed, and I was watching a television show.
It was a television show -- it was a NOVA show on PBS -- about caves in New Mexico.
And this particular cave was Lechuguilla, and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans.
It was a television show -- it was a NOVA show on PBS -- about caves in New Mexico.
And this particular cave was Lechuguilla, and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans.
The researchers had to suit up just to enter it.
So that's kind of a tough day, but I said, "There really is some basis for thinking why you might want to do this."
As I said, this agent is in us, and, in fact, here's a curious thing, it binds to the very place inside of your cells where oxygen binds, and where you burn it, and that you do this burning to live.
And so we thought, like in a game of musical chairs, might we be able to give a person some hydrogen sulfide, and might it be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind?
And so, we wanted to find out might we be able to use hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold, and we wanted to see whether we could reproduce this skier in a mammal.
Now, mammals are warm-blooded creatures, and when we get cold, we shake and we shiver, right?
We try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees by actually burning more oxygen.
Now, mammals are warm-blooded creatures, and when we get cold, we shake and we shiver, right?
We try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees by actually burning more oxygen.
So, it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse when it was also cold because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold.
We try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees by actually burning more oxygen.
So, it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse when it was also cold because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold.
It stopped moving.
Its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold.
And here's the really important point.
I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.
Its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold.
And here's the really important point.
I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.
We also found out that we could subject animals to otherwise lethal blood loss, and we could save them if we gave them hydrogen sulfide.
So these proof of concept experiments led me to say "I should found a company, and we should take this out to a wider playing field."
I founded a company called Ikaria with others' help.


If you think about the phone -- and Intel has tested a lot of the things I'm going to show you, in about 600 elderly households -- 300 in Ireland, and 300 in Portland -- trying to understand: How do we measure and monitor behavior in a medically meaningful way?
This is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar, but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it and do something about it. We'll wait until it's more of a catastrophe, and react, as opposed to prepare for it.
So, one of the reasons it's so challenging to prepare for this Y2K problem is, I want to argue, we have what I would call mainframe poisoning.
Andy Grove, about six or seven years ago, he doesn't even know or remember this, in a Fortune Magazine article he used the phrase "mainframe healthcare," and I've been extending and expanding this.
And the problem with this is the way we conceive healthcare. Right?
This is a very reactive, crisis-driven system.
We're doing 15-minute exams with patients.
The president needs to stand up and say, at the end of a healthcare reform debate, "Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care out of institutions, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes, to the home, in 10 years."
It's achievable. We should do it economically, we should do it morally, and we should do it for quality of life.
But there is no goal within this health reform.
It's just a mess today.
So, you know, that's my last message to you.
How do we set a going-to-the-moon goal of dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming?
And at night I would lie out, looking at the unpolluted sky, as Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid, and I used to stare at the universe and say, "How far does this universe go?"
My father was a doctor.
And I would think, "Daddy, how far does the universe go?"
And, because democracy still exists, there's a democratic way in which you say "Well, if you give us what [we want], we'll give you water."
So, okay my time is up.
But I can go on about telling you how we evolve stories, and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that I am in, which is film.
Harmony is the suggestion of a thing that is much larger than resolution.
Harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal and of eternity and of the moment.
Resolution is something that is far more limited.

I'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values.
Now, it's generally understood that questions of morality -- questions of good and evil and right and wrong -- are questions about which science officially has no opinion.
But if we're going to talk about human well-being we are, of necessity, talking about the human brain.
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain -- whatever happens after death.
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife, in this life, his personality -- his rather unfortunate personality -- is the product of his brain.
And so, how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being?
Well, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.
The concept of physical health is undefined.
It's now around 80 in the developed world.
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.
People will send you donations when you're in that condition.
Why would we think this?
Consider, by analogy, the game of chess.
Now, if you're going to play good chess, a principle like, "Don't lose your Queen," is very good to follow.
Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering? No.
How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being?
So, this, I think, is what the world needs now.
This is a Viking Lander photograph of the surface of Mars.
And yes, the red planet is red.
Mars is half the size of the Earth, but because two-thirds of the Earth is covered by water, the land area on Mars is comparable to the land area on Earth.
We addressed on the board the major questions that have not been answered.
And we spent two days deciding how to best answer this question.
And the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES.
And our goal is to inspire the American public who is paying for this mission through tax dollars.
But more important we will inspire the next generation of scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians.
And that's a critical area of national security and economic vitality, to make sure we produce the next generation of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists.
In two words, very carefully.
The problem is we don't fly it to Mars, we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to Mars.
The problem is the spacecraft's largest diameter is nine feet; ARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long.
The problem is we don't fly it to Mars, we put it in a spacecraft and we send it to Mars.
The problem is the spacecraft's largest diameter is nine feet; ARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long.
How do we get it to Mars?
This is a half-scale model.
This is a high-altitude helium balloon.
This is over Tilamook, Oregon.
And let me conclude by saying not too far from here, right down the road in Kittyhawk, North Carolina, a little more than 100 years ago history was made when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth.
We are on the verge right now to make the first flight of an airplane outside the Earth's atmosphere.
We are prepared to fly this on Mars, rewrite the textbook about Mars.
This is not about lousy marriages, this is not about jobs that suck.
This is about people who can not walk away, people who are forced to work without pay, people who are operating 24/7 under a threat of violence and have no pay.
It's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history.
We understand how that works. In some countries all of those things happen at once, like Sierra Leone a few years ago, and push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world, in fact, as we know, live on the edge, live in situations where they don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute.
But that doesn't make you a slave either.
What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable into a slave, is the absence of the rule of law.
D: Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen, thank you very much.
Kevin Bales: Okay, you figured it out. That's a spoof.
Though I enjoyed watching your jaws drop, drop, drop, until you got it.
But there is actually a very positive side to this, and that is this: The 27 million people who are in slavery today, that's a lot of people, but it's also the smallest fraction of the global population to ever be in slavery.
And likewise, the 40 billion dollars that they generate into the global economy each year is the tiniest proportion of the global economy to ever be represented by slave labor.
Slavery, illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society.

Girl: I like adventurous books, and some of my favorites are Alfred Hitchcock and [unclear] and Hardy Boys.
Although they are like in different contexts, one is magical, the other two are like investigation, I like those books because they have something special in them.
The vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing.
We have, a few months ago, actually late last year, we had a few mothers who came to us and said, "You know, we want to learn how to read and write.
Can you teach us?" So, we started an afterschool for our parents, for our mothers.
We had 25 mothers who came regularly after school to study.
My accent with English improved a lot.
And I learned football, volleyball, Frisbee, lots of games.
And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here.

Children's publisher not working with children?
I don't know, you're kind of alienating a large client there.
One publisher, Action Publishing, was willing to take that leap and trust me, and to listen to what I had to say.

They published my first book, "Flying Fingers," you see it here.
Now, funnily enough, this is also Joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment.
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.
But it is changing the equation of what's rational in sexual decision-making.
They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers.
I get this sort of unrequested -- by me anyway -- visit, and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon from the military and the guy that runs DARPA.
They proceed to tell me a story which comes down to basically the following. We have used such advanced technologies now and made them available in the most remote places that we put soldiers: hills of Afghanistan, Iraq ...
You're going to give us an arm."
And I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy, paperwork and DODs.
No, the guy says, "We're going to bring a guy into this conference room, and wearing the arm you're going to give us, he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape off this table.
No, the guy says, "We're going to bring a guy into this conference room, and wearing the arm you're going to give us, he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape off this table.
If it's the grape, they won't break it."
Great he needs efferent, afferent, haptic response sensors.
Look what it takes to make things like iPods.
"Great," he said, "You got two years."
I said, "I'll tell you what. I'll build you an arm that's under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year.
Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it, doing either of those.
Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary, at least for my limited physical skill.
And now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for.
I was talking to one of them, and he was really liking this arm -- it's way, way, way better than a plastic stick with a hook on it -- but there's nobody in this room that would rather have that than the one you got.
But I was saying to him, "You know, the first airplane went 100 feet in 1903.
Wilbur and Orville.
But now we got Eagles out there, F15s, even that Bald Eagle.
I've never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2.
I think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary."
But my robot, STriDER, does not move like this.
So, this is an actual dynamic simulation animation.
I'm just going to show you how the robot works.
It's a constantly falling process.
So, even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this, really, we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot. Thus it's a biologically inspired robot.
What you see over here, this is what we want to do next.

We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion.
What you see over here, this is what we want to do next.
We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion.
And it deploys legs -- it looks almost like "Star Wars" -- when it lands, it absorbs the shock and starts walking.
The second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS.
It stands for Intelligent Mobility Platform with Actuated Spoke System.
So, it's a wheel-leg hybrid robot.
We are literally re-inventing the wheel here.
Let me demonstrate how it works.
So, in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach.
Let me demonstrate how it works.
So, in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach.
Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet, it's trying to walk over a changing terrain, a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes.
So, in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach.
Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet, it's trying to walk over a changing terrain, a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes.
And just by the tactile information, it successfully crosses over these type of terrain.
But the current rovers cannot get there.
So, inspired by that we wanted to build a robot that can climb a structured cliff environment.
So, this is CLIMBeR.

So, what it does, it has three legs. It's probably difficult to see, but it has a winch and a cable at the top -- and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot.

So, what it does, it has three legs. It's probably difficult to see, but it has a winch and a cable at the top -- and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot.
And then once it figures that out in real time, it calculates the force distribution: how much force it needs to exert to the surface so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.
Also for search and rescue applications as well.
Five years ago I actually worked at NASA JPL during the summer as a faculty fellow.
And they already had a six legged robot called LEMUR.
We developed our adaptive gait planner.
We actually have a very interesting payload on there.
The students like to have fun. And here you can see that it's walking over unstructured terrain.
Now, we don't have enough time to go into technical details, I'll just show you some of the experiments.
So, this is some of the early feasibility experiments.
We store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move.
Or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward. It's called ChIMERA.
We also have been working with some scientists and engineers from UPenn to come up with a chemically actuated version of this amoeba robot.
We do something to something And just like magic, it moves. The blob.
And this student, probably the first time using it, but she can articulate it many different ways.
So, for example in Iraq, you know, the war zone, there is roadside bombs. Currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed.
It takes really a lot of time and it's expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm.
For those who probably know, if you don't have any sensors and there are any disturbances, you know what happens.
So, based on that success, the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics.
And thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.
I don't know how many of you have heard about RoboCup.
It's an international autonomous robot soccer competition.
And the goal of RoboCup, the actual goal is, by the year 2050 we want to have full size, autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human World Cup champions and win.

So, right next to my bed I keep a notebook, a journal, with a special pen that has a light on it, LED light, because I don't want to turn on the light and wake up my wife.
So, I see this, scribble everything down, draw things, and I go to bed.
Every day in the morning, the first thing I do before my first cup of coffee, before I brush my teeth, I open my notebook.
Four very different habitats might look similar, but they've got very different pollen signatures.
Actually this one is particularly easy, these pictures were all taken in different countries.
But pollen forensics can be very subtle.

The next poem is "If No One Ever Marries Me."
She was the daughter of a very, very famous Dutch painter who had made his fame in England.
He went there after the death of his wife of smallpox and brought his two young children.
One was his daughter, Laurence.
He died typhoid fever at the age of 44, I believe, 43 or 44.
At the time, he was teaching classics at Trinity College in Dublin.
A few years before he died, after he had resumed writing poetry, but in secret, he confessed to a friend in a letter that I found when I was doing my research: "I've written a verse.
It is to explain death to a child, and it deserves a piece of plain-song music."
And my blood froze when I read that because I had written the plain-song music 130 years after he'd written the letter.
And the poem is called, "Spring and Fall."
In the 1960s and 1970s, the Vietnam War was basically shown in America's living rooms day in, day out.
News photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war: a little girl burned by napalm, a student killed by the National Guard at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest.
In fact, these images became the voices of protest themselves.
But images don't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war.
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery.
After all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world, there's one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still, much more than the others.
And so, we wanted to know, how green could we be?
And there's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade-offs.
And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room.
Now, the average house has about 300 megawatt hours of embodied energy in it; this is the energy it takes to make it -- millions and millions of paper towels.
We wanted to know how much better we could do.
And so, like many people, we start with a house on a lot, and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom.
We wanted to know how much better we could do.
And so, like many people, we start with a house on a lot, and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom.
So first, we demolish it.
If we put aluminum windows in this house, we would double the energy use right there.
Now, PVC is a little bit better, but still not as good as the wood that we chose.
We then put in plumbing, and insulate.
So now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up, and we've built a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this.
But before we pat ourselves too much on the back, we have poured 151 megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before.
And so the question is: How could we make that back?
I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.
I grew up in Mobile, Alabama -- somebody's got to be from Mobile, right? -- and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers, forming this beautiful delta.
And the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes, birds of every flavor.
And I remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six.
I was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.
And I reached down and picked him up, and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.
And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it, raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes.
I'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!
So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him, so I put him down.
I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me, and he had little horns come up above his eyes.
So I went right up to the front of the tank -- I was three or four inches from the front glass -- and the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock, and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away, and at that time I could actually focus that close; now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.

So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away, and at that time I could actually focus that close; now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.
Anyway, there we were, staring at each other, and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system, and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.
And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart, creating a rift valley.
And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this 40,000 mile range.
And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart, magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps, and you're looking land -- new land -- being created right before your eyes.
And out of the tops of these tube worms are these beautiful red plumes.
And living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals: shrimp, fish, lobsters, crab, clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold.
And this whole ecosystem wasn't even known about until 33 years ago.

And it completely threw science on its head.
But down there, there is no sun, there is no photosynthesis; it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it, and it's all so ephemeral.
You might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent, which you think at the time has to be on another planet.
It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth; it looks like aliens in an alien environment.
But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite.
I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.
And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck," and go and work on the other side of the island.
I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.
And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck," and go and work on the other side of the island.
Five years later, come back, and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.
It's got living coral, fish all over the place, crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?"
Well, how it happened is the local community galvanized.
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it; enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay, and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay, and the bay recovered.


The brilliant playwright, Adrienne Kennedy, wrote a volume called "People Who Led to My Plays."
I was interested in the idea of why and how I could create a new story, a new narrative in art history and a new narrative in the world.
And to do this, I knew that I had to see the way in which artists work, understand the artist's studio as a laboratory, imagine, then, reinventing the museum as a think tank and looking at the exhibition as the ultimate white paper -- asking questions, providing the space to look and to think about answers.
In 1994, when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum, I made an exhibition called Black Male.

In 1994, when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum, I made an exhibition called Black Male.
It looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art.
It looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art.
It sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for dialogue -- complicated dialogue, dialogue with many, many points of entry -- and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas.
This exhibition included over 20 artists of various ages and races, but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view.
One of the things that happened very distinctly in the course of this exhibition is I was confronted with the idea of how powerful images can be in people's understanding of themselves and each other.
I'm showing you two works, one on the right by Leon Golub, one on the left by Robert Colescott.
And in the course of the exhibition -- which was contentious, controversial and ultimately, for me, life-changing in my sense of what art could be -- a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other.
Where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation?
Really, most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring.
Their works for me are about, not always just simply about the aesthetic innovation that their minds imagine, that their visions create and put out there in the world, but more, perhaps, importantly, through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation, as well as in the future.
Now, this exhibition, as I said, 40 young artists done over the course of eight years, and for me it's about considering the implications.
It's considering the implications of what this generation has to say to the rest of us.
It's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as their work travels, but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us.
In the spirit of Jacques Cousteau, who said, "People protect what they love," I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean, and that's the incredible number and variety of animals in it that make light.
My addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp; that's not an acronym -- just somebody thought it looked like the insect.
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet.
And so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers to develop automatic recognition systems that can identify these animals and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point.
And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land, and do nearest neighbor distances.
But you don't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this.
And sometimes you can see it even closer than that, because the heads on ships -- that's toilets, for any land lovers that are listening -- are flushed with unfiltered seawater that often has bioluminescent plankton in it.
So, if you stagger into the head late at night and you're so toilet-hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light, you may think that you're having a religious experience.  So, how does a living creature make light?
Well, that was the question that 19th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois, asked about this bioluminescent clam.
So, if you stagger into the head late at night and you're so toilet-hugging sick that you forget to turn on the light, you may think that you're having a religious experience.  So, how does a living creature make light?
Well, that was the question that 19th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois, asked about this bioluminescent clam.
He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals; one, the enzyme, he called luciferase; the substrate, he called luciferin after Lucifer the Lightbearer.
Another thing all these molecules are telling us that, apparently, bioluminescence has evolved at least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times in evolutionary history, which is a clear indication of how spectacularly important this trait is for survival.
So, what is it about bioluminescence that's so important to so many animals?
Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness, light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive: and that's find food, attract a mate and avoid being eaten.

Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness, light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive: and that's find food, attract a mate and avoid being eaten.
So, for example, this fish has a built-in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate.
This fish actually has high beams.
And this fish, which is one of my favorites, has three headlights on each side of its head.
Now, this one is blue, and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication.

Now, this one is blue, and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication.
So, most animals make blue light, and most animals can only see blue light, but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs.

So, most animals make blue light, and most animals can only see blue light, but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs.
And I have no idea why there's two, and that's something I want to solve some day -- but not only can it see blue light, but it can see red light.

And I have no idea why there's two, and that's something I want to solve some day -- but not only can it see blue light, but it can see red light.
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen.
Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure was to attract different types of prey, but then stomach content analyses on these fish done by scientists, or more likely their graduate students, have revealed that they all eat pretty much the same thing.
So, now we believe that the different shape of the lure is how the male recognizes the female in the anglerfish world, because many of these males are what are known as dwarf males.
This little guy has no visible means of self-support.
A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud.
This shrimp is actually spewing light out of its mouth like a fire breathing dragon in order to blind or distract this viperfish so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness.
And there are a lot of different animals that can do this: There's jellyfish, there's squid, there's a whole lot of different crustaceans, there's even fish that can do this.
So I'm holding it, and I'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder, and when I do, you'll see bioluminescence coming out.
But to me, what's shocking is not just the amount of light, but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase.
For this fish, it's actually whole cells with nuclei and membranes.
Now, another form of defense is something called a burglar alarm -- same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car; the honking horn and flashing lights are meant to attract the attention of, hopefully, the police that will come and take the burglar away -- when an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator, its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of something bigger and nastier
that will attack their attacker, thereby affording them a chance for escape.
This jellyfish, for example, has a spectacular bioluminescent display.
That's me on the left, my graduate student at the time, Erika Raymond, and Lee Fry, who was the engineer on the project.
And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor with the caption: "Engineer satisfying two women at once."  And we were very, very happy.
So now we had a system that we could actually take to some place that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean that might be patrolled by large predators.
Now, I prefer that term over magician, because if I were a magician, that would mean that I use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic.
No, I don't do that; I'm a conjurer, who is someone who pretends to be a real magician.  Now, how do we go about that sort of thing?
We depend on the fact that audiences, such as yourselves, will make assumptions.

As a matter of fact, this is something that about half of you, more than half of you will not be familiar with.

First question: If I want to ask them to call up -- because they do hear them through the ear.
Good bye."
And she didn't answer the damn question!
Where is the will?
Where is the will?
Now, she could easily have said, "Oh, it's in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia," but she doesn't say that. No, she doesn't.
She doesn't bring any useful information to us.
It's exactly equivalent to taking one 325 milligram aspirin tablet, throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe, and then stirring it up, obviously with a very big stick, and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous.
Then, when you get a headache, you take a sip of this water, and -- voila! -- it is gone.
Now that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about.
That's really sad to hear, and it hasn't helped them one bit, hasn't solved any of their problems.
Yes, there could be a rotting of the American mind, and of the minds all the way around the earth, if we don't start to think sensibly about these things.
Now, we've offered this carrot, as I say, we've dangled the carrot.
So, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?
You can send them an email.
Well, unfortunately, I've got so many Viagra ads coming at me, your email is lost.
When you do this, don't attack people; you attack tactics.
Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.
Paragraph number three: When animals are attacked or cornered, they will fight to the death, so you have to give them an exit.
And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read.
So, what your letter means: I've got to tell you, we are all in a party, and political officials are the pinatas.
We are harangued, lectured to, sold, marketed, but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication.
After the war, lots of these songs were lost, but they are a part of our childhood and our history, and we should not forget them."

So I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea.

So I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea.
Actually, I think it'll eventually be seen as probably the single biggest idea that's emerged in the past century.
It's the idea of computation.
Now, of course, that idea has brought us all of the computer technology we have today and so on.
But there's actually a lot more to computation than that.
Now we get another result, still very simple.
Try changing it again.
You get something a little bit more complicated.
This is just an example of one of these computable documents.
This is probably a fairly small piece of Mathematica code that's able to be run here.
Okay. Let's zoom out again.
But in the computational universe, we've now seen how rules that are incredibly simple can produce incredibly rich and complex behavior.
So could that be what's going on with our whole universe?
If the rules for the universe are simple, it's kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level; operating, for example, far below the level of space or time, which makes it hard to represent things.
One's got to build a lot of technology.
One's got to build a structure that's probably at least as deep as existing physics.
And I'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is.
So, the following year, I set out and, fortunately, this time made it safely across to Hawaii.
But it was not without misadventure.
My watermaker broke, only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.
Fortunately, the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.
When they opened this one up, they found its stomach was full of plastic.
And this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance.
The second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions.
We might think that anything that we do as an individual is just a drop in the ocean, that it can't really make a difference.
But it does. Generally, we haven't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters.
And the two here are just examples.
One is the cellphone, which we use every day.
And it rests on a complexity, which has some characteristics very different from those that my friend Benoit Mandelbrot discussed, but are very interesting.
And it rests on a complexity, which has some characteristics very different from those that my friend Benoit Mandelbrot discussed, but are very interesting.
And the other, of course, is a birth control pill, which, in a very simple way, fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices.
So, there are two ways of thinking about this word, I think.
We have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is.
Simplicity, for reasons that are a little bit obscure, is almost not pursued, at least in the academic world.
We academics -- I am an academic -- we love complexity.
Here's another example, which I put up because it's an example of really important current science.
You can't possibly read that. It's not intended that you read it, but that's a tiny part of the chemical reactions going on in each of your cells at any given moment.
And it's like the traffic that you see.
And I want to introduce a word that I think is very useful, which is stacking.
And I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity that has the characteristic that it is so simple and so reliable that I can build things with it.
Or I'm going to use simple to mean reliable, predictable, repeatable.
And I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity that has the characteristic that it is so simple and so reliable that I can build things with it.
Or I'm going to use simple to mean reliable, predictable, repeatable.
And I'm going to use as an example the Internet, because it's a particularly good example of stacked simplicity.

We call it a complex system, which it is, but it's also something else.
The virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way of representing numbers.
Anything else is more complicated.
You can catch errors with it, it's unambiguous in its reading, there are lots of good things about binary.
Now wall switches, we all know, fail.
But our friends who are condensed matter physicists managed to come up, some 50 years ago, with a very nice device, shown under that bell jar, which is a transistor.
A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch.
And then back to simplicity again.
So here we have what I think is one of the great ideas, which is Google.
Which, in this simple portal makes the claim that it makes accessible all of the world's information.
So, how does one do that?
This is a world in which there's no electricity, there's no money, there's no medical competence.
And I don't want to spend your time in going through the details, but in the lower right-hand corner, you see an example of the kind of thing that we have.
This is a world in which there's no electricity, there's no money, there's no medical competence.
And I don't want to spend your time in going through the details, but in the lower right-hand corner, you see an example of the kind of thing that we have.
It's a little paper chip.
Imagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised -- maybe you're a politician in a developing country and you have a budget to spend. You want to spend it on the poor: How do you go about it?
Do you believe the people who tell you that all we need to do is to spend money?
That we know how to eradicate poverty, we just need to do more?
And for every hundred dollars, you get almost 30 extra years of education.
So this is not your intuition, this is not what people would have gone for, and yet, these are the programs that work.
We need that kind of information, we need more of it, and then we need to guide policy.

So now, I started from the big problem, and I couldn't answer it.
Well, I think what part of the problem is that, in Haiti, although the problem is huge, somehow we understand it, it's localized.
You give your money to Doctors Without Borders, you give your money to Partners In Health, and they'll send in the doctors, and they'll send in the lumber, and they'll helicopter things out and in.
And the problem of poverty is not like that.
And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled, powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified, better funded -- and they didn't achieve powered man flight, and the Wright brothers beat them to it.
There's something else at play here.
About three and a half years ago, I made a discovery.

That's how most marketing and sales are done, that's how we communicate interpersonally.
We say what we do, we say how we're different or better and we expect some sort of a behavior, a purchase, a vote, something like that.
Here's our new law firm: We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients, we always perform for our clients.
It's also responsible for all human behavior, all decision-making, and it has no capacity for language.
In other words, when we communicate from the outside in, yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures.
It just doesn't drive behavior.
When we can communicate from the inside out, we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do.
This is where gut decisions come from.
Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, "I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn't feel right."
It's all happening here in your limbic brain, the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.
But if you don't know why you do what you do, and people respond to why you do what you do, then how will you ever get people to vote for you, or buy something from you, or, more importantly, be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do.
The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.
I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk Time Warner DVR all the time.
But TiVo's a commercial failure.
They've never made money.

And when they went IPO, their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10.
He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America.
He went around and told people what he believed.
"I believe, I believe, I believe," he told people.
I mean, somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet.
And that was what I did.
And I ended up in Jamaica, in the West Indies, where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary, structurally, that I ever saw in my life.

And this picture here, it's really interesting, it shows two things: First of all, it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far, and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s, you took pictures in black and white.
And I'm going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution: one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients.
So this is the infamous Caulerpa taxifolia, the so-called killer algae.
A book was written about it.
We don't know anything that eats it, we're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done, but, as it stands, it's the monster from hell, about which nobody knows what to do.
Now another form of pollution that's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients.
The green revolution, all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it.
I came back in '86.
I had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country, which had 60 percent landlessness but amazing creativity.
I started looking at my own work: The work that I had done for the previous 10 years, almost every time, had instances of knowledge that people had shared.
So much so, that much of my work till that time was in the English language.
The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English.
So what kind of a contributor was I?
So I did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research, wrote, read about 100 papers.
And I came to the conclusion that while dilemma is unique, dilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique.
And one day -- I don't know what happened -- while coming back from the office towards home, maybe I saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee, life would be wonderful.

And one day -- I don't know what happened -- while coming back from the office towards home, maybe I saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee, life would be wonderful.
What the honey bee does: it pollinates, takes nectar from the flower, pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.
You cannot be in favor of your own values, which are at a distance from the values that you espouse.
So, fairness to one and to the other is not divisible.
Look at this picture.
Look at this. This is the site of the government of India.
It invites tourists to see the shame of our country.
I'm so sorry to say that.
Now, what is the beauty in it?
When you have a non-stick pan, it costs about, maybe, 250 rupees, five dollars, six dollars.
This is less than a dollar and this is non-stick; it is coated with one of these food-grade materials.

This is less than a dollar and this is non-stick; it is coated with one of these food-grade materials.
And the best part is that, while you use a costly non-stick pan, you eat the so-called Teflon or Teflon-like material because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?

AG: Saidulluh Sahib is in Motihari, again in Champaran.
Wonderful human being, but he stills sells, at this age, honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood, because we haven't been able to convince the water park people, the lake people, in [unclear] operations.
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago and people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water -- that, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.
We have sold things all over the world, from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever.
Products have gone to the market, a few.
These are the people whose knowledge made this Herbavate cream for eczema possible.

These are the people whose knowledge made this Herbavate cream for eczema possible.
And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it, it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.
And if you look at this image, you can right away see clusters of happy and unhappy people, again, spreading to three degrees of separation.
And you might form the intuition that the unhappy people occupy a different structural location within the network.
There's a middle and an edge to this network, and the unhappy people seem to be located at the edges.
And we do that for a couple of reasons.
We invent for fun -- invention is a lot of fun to do -- and we also invent for profit.
The two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun, you wouldn't have the time to do it.
Now, one of these Styrofoam chests will last for about four hours with ice in it.
And we thought, well, that's not really good enough.
So we made this thing.
Now, the reason we were able to come up with this is two key ideas: One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar, something you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in.
They have incredible insulation, so let's put some incredible insulation here.
The other idea is kind of interesting, which is, you can't reach inside anymore.
The other idea is kind of interesting, which is, you can't reach inside anymore.
Because if you open it up and reach inside, you'd let the heat in, the game would be over.
So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine.
You can distribute bed nets, and bed nets are very effective if you use them.
You don't always use them for that. People fish with them.
They don't always get to everyone.
And bed nets have an effect on the epidemic, but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets.
Now, malaria is an incredibly complicated disease.
We could spend hours going over this.
Now, malaria is an incredibly complicated disease.
We could spend hours going over this.
It's got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle; they have sex, they burrow into your liver, they tunnel into your blood cells ...
it's an incredibly complicated disease, but that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it and why we work on malaria: There's a lot of potential ways in.
One of those ways might be better diagnosis.
So we hope this year to prototype each of these devices.
The other thing is, you know, it would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood.
And if you look through the eye, or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye, in fact, you may be able to do this directly, without drawing any blood at all, or through your nail beds.
Because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels, and once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria.

Because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels, and once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria.
We can see it because of this molecule called hemozoin.
This is malaria spreading across Madagascar.
And this is this latter part of the rainy season.
We're going to the dry season now.
And this is this latter part of the rainy season.
We're going to the dry season now.
It nearly goes away in the dry season, because there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed.
This is one of those things you just can't make up.
Once upon a time, this was the primary technique, and, in fact, many countries got rid of malaria through DDT.
The United States did.
In 1935, there were 150,000 cases a year of malaria in the United States, but DDT and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it.
So we thought, "Well, we've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium, the parasite involved.
What can we do to the mosquito?
Of course, if you do that, you could also protect your backyard.
And farmers could protect their crops that they want to sell to Whole Foods because our photons are 100 percent organic.  They're completely natural.
Now, it actually gets better than this.
So, this sounds really crazy, right?
Would you like to see it?
Audience: Yeah!
Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve, and the closer you get to the reserve, the more fish you have.
So the fishermen are catching more.
You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up.

Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something -- a movie, an album, a song or a book -- to someone you also really liked, and you anticipated that reaction, you waited for it, and it came back, and the person hated it?
So, by way of introduction, that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years.  I teach high school math.
To start with, I'd like to break math down into two categories.
One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.
For example, factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one.
For example, factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one.
This stuff is also really easy to relearn, provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning. Math reasoning -- we'll call it the application of math processes to the world around us -- this is hard to teach.
This is what we would love students to retain, even if they don't go into mathematical fields.

This is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.
I believe in real life.
And ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever, that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance; where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out, or you didn't have sufficient information and had to go find some.
I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving.
And here's how it works.
I like this question. It's about a water tank.
Does the color of the valve matter? What matters here?"
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum.
So now we have a water tank.
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum.
So now we have a water tank.
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.
So now we have the real deal.
How long will it take it to fill it up?
And then even better is we take a video, a video of someone filling it up.
We're no longer averse to word problems, because we've redefined what a word problem is.
We're no longer intimidated by math, because we're slowly redefining what math is.
This has been a lot of fun.
because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways: It's buying you out of your obligation, for patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful.
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.
It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap, and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.

Good afternoon.
There's a medical revolution happening all around us, and it's one that's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions, including cancer.
And after injury, blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound.
And this is actually what it looks like, hundreds of blood vessels, all growing toward the center of the wound.
So the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time.
About 50 percent of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers, and virtually 100 percent of us, by the time we reach our 70s, will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid.
Yet, without a blood supply, most of these cancers will never become dangerous.
Dr. Judah Folkman, who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field, once called this "cancer without disease."
But once angiogenesis occurs, cancers can grow exponentially.
And this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless, to being deadly.
Cancer cells mutate, and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors, natural fertilizer, that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer.
So let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples.
This is 20-year-old dolphin living in Florida, and she had these lesions in her mouth that, over the course of three years, developed into invasive squamous cell cancers.
So we created an antiangiogenic paste.
That's impressive.
But for other tumors and cancer types, the improvements have only been modest.
So I started asking myself, "Why haven't we been able to do better?"
And the answer, to me, is obvious: we're treating cancer too late in the game, when it's already established, and oftentimes, it's already spread or metastasized.
And as a doctor, I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage, achieving a cure can be difficult, if not impossible.
So I went back to the biology of angiogenesis, and started thinking: Could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis, beating cancer at its own game, so the cancers could never become dangerous?
At the center is a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion.
And we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating.
Let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes.
And like a tumor, fat grows when blood vessels grow.
So the question is: Can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply?
The top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse that eats nonstop until it turns fat, like this furry tennis ball.  And the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse.

If you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor, it loses weight.
Stop the treatment, gains the weight back. Restart the treatment, loses the weight.
I studied marine iguanas at that point.
But this is a global phenomenon, we know that.
And if you look along the coast of Argentina, where I work now, at a place called Punta Tombo -- the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees south latitude -- you see that there's great variation here.
This is a picture at Punta Tombo in February showing all the penguins along the beach.
I went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them and turning them into high fashion golf gloves, protein and oil.
Fortunately, nobody has harvested any penguins and we're getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them.
And penguins are always involved in helping us or not helping us in one way or another.
This is a radio frequency ID system.
You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin that has a barcode, so it tells you who it is.
He unplugs the wire; we have no data.
So, they really are pretty amazing creatures.
OK.
Oh, by the way, if you think you're very far from some of this oil, 1000 meters below where you're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world.
Come talk to me about it, I'll fill in some of the details if you want.
So, that's one of the stories of oil; there's just a lot of it.
Come talk to me about it, I'll fill in some of the details if you want.
So, that's one of the stories of oil; there's just a lot of it.
But what about oil? Where is it in the energy system?
Here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil, and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years.
Now, here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about: For the last 25 years, oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems.
There was one kind of peak oil in 1985, when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply.
Now, here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about: For the last 25 years, oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems.
There was one kind of peak oil in 1985, when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply.
Now, it's about 35 percent.
And what goes on in the future?
Well, I think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas, and beyond that, peak renewables.
Now, I'll tell you another little, very important story about this picture.
And what goes on in the future?
Well, I think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas, and beyond that, peak renewables.
Now, I'll tell you another little, very important story about this picture.
What is the future of truly sustainable, carbon-free energy?
Well, we have to take a little excursion, and we'll start in central Texas.
Here's a piece of limestone.

We're here today to announce the first synthetic cell, a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer, building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals, assembling that chromosome in yeast, transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species.
So this is the first self-replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer.
It was the first DNA phage, DNA virus, DNA genome that was actually sequenced.
So once we realized that we could make 5,000-base pair viral-sized pieces, we thought, we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this mega base chromosome.
So, substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially.
But at the time, that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made.
And so both sides were progressing, but part of the synthesis had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast, putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us.
It's an amazing step forward, but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast.
So our team developed new techniques for actually growing, cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast.
So we took the same mycoides genome that Carole had initially transplanted, and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome.
And we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them.
When we did these experiments, though, we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell.
That little issue took the team two years to solve.
It turns out, the DNA in the bacterial cell was actually methylated, and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme, from digesting the DNA.
Because of the problems with Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago, we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome, the mycoides chromosome, knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation.
And Dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one-million-base pair chromosome.
But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end, and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence.
We narrowed it down to one fragment; we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene.
So accuracy is essential.
There's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error, and then there's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of DNA, as we did with the watermarks, and it can tolerate all kinds of errors.
Early on, when you're working in a new area of science, you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you to believe that you had done something when you hadn't, and, even worse, leading others to believe it.
So, we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome, leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell, when it would have been just a contaminant.
So early on, we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the DNA to absolutely make clear that the DNA was synthetic.
The first is, "To live, to err, to fall, to triumph and to recreate life out of life."
It's a James Joyce quote.
The second quotation is, "See things not as they are, but as they might be."
I think they were given to TEDsters in a box, a box set of DVDs, which they put on their shelves, where they are now.
And actually, Chris called me a week after I'd given my talk, and said, "We're going to start putting them online. Can we put yours online?"
And I said, "Sure."

And four years later, it's been downloaded four million times.
He said this in December 1862 to the second annual meeting of Congress.
I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time.
We don't teach American history in Britain.
And at the heart of our challenges --  At the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence.
This linearity thing is a problem.
When I arrived in L.A. about nine years ago, I came across a policy statement -- very well-intentioned -- which said, "College begins in kindergarten."
There are two models of quality assurance in catering.
One is fast food, where everything is standardized.
The other is like Zagat and Michelin restaurants, where everything is not standardized, they're customized to local circumstances.
My wife's just finished writing a novel, and I think it's a great book, but she disappears for hours on end.
You know this, if you're doing something you love, an hour feels like five minutes.
If you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit, five minutes feels like an hour.
So I think we have to change metaphors.
We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education, a manufacturing model, which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people.
We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture.
I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada.
She's an Italian fashion designer.
She goes to this vintage store in Paris with a friend of hers.

Her friend says, "Buy it already."
And sometimes these are fun, right?
Now, the reason for this, the reason that the fashion industry doesn't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection.
They didn't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing.
Now, fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry.
This wedding dress here is actually made of sporks, and this dress is actually made of aluminum.
I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through.
There's lots of virtues of copying.
One that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to is that we now have a much broader palette of design choices to choose from than we ever have before, and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry, actually.
And this is a good thing. We need lots of options.
Now, some fashion designers will say, "It's only in the United States that we don't have any respect.
In other countries there is protection for our artful designs."
But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world, it turns out that the protection that's offered is really ineffectual.
Very low novelty standard, anybody can register anything.
But even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry and you have a lot of luxury designers there, they don't register their garments, generally, and there's not a lot of litigation.
It turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low.
It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time, and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive.
You know, it's not just the fashion industry that doesn't have copyright protection.
There's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection, including the food industry.
Open source software, these guys decided they didn't want copyright protection.
They thought it'd be more innovative without it.
It's really hard to get copyright for databases.

Or is it a physically fixed expression of an idea: something that somebody made and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it?
The problem is that digital technology has completely subverted the logic of this physically fixed, expression versus idea concept.
Nowadays, we don't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold.

Nowadays, we don't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold.
It's a digital file.
He's smart, he's smart.
But you want an interdisciplinary team of people hashing this out, trying to figure out: What is the kind of ownership model, in a digital world, that's going to lead to the most innovation?
And my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future.
He called these, "massively fatal discontinuities," meaning that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years.
He looked at the odds of another world war, of a massive volcanic eruption, even of an asteroid hitting the Earth.
But he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to 100 percent, and that is a severe flu pandemic.
Now, you might think of flu as just a really bad cold, but it can be a death sentence.
Every year, 36,000 people in the United States die of seasonal flu.
In the developing world, the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher.
In the developing world, the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher.
You know, the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically, it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic.
In 1918, a new virus appeared that killed some 50 to 100 million people.
Well, here's the dirty little secret.
Until recently, we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked.
We knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error.
Dendritic cells, or macrophages, capture the virus and display pieces of it.
Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the front-line troops.
These memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed.
So the real question then is: How do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV?
The principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they're always changing.
So let's take a look at the flu virus.
So, you've got this situation: In 2003, we had an H5N1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent.
Now luckily, that particular virus, although very scary at the time, did not transmit from person to person very easily.
This year's H1N1 threat was actually a human, avian, swine mixture that arose in Mexico.
Now let's take a look at HIV.
As variable as flu is, HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibraltar.
The virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted.
Now let's take a look at HIV.
As variable as flu is, HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibraltar.
The virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted.
Now, what does this mean?
We saw earlier that HIV is highly variable, that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus.
If you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models, they provide full protection from infection.
We saw earlier that HIV is highly variable, that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus.
If you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models, they provide full protection from infection.
In addition, these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab onto, and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates.
So far, animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease, although you might get a mild case.
So if this works in humans, what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine, one that doesn't need to change every year and would remove the threat of death.
We really could think of flu, then, as just a bad cold.
With a range of new technologies, we could.
Here's an example: A company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system.
If you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium, which creates a vigorous immune response, they've created a very powerful flu fighter.
It's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art.
LL: And so then, what this libertarian draws from these two points ...
JS: One remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience.
The problem, as we see it, has to do with a single, simple word: "space," or a single, simple phrase: "real world geometry."
Computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in, that we teach them in, are hideously insensate when it comes to space.
They don't understand real world space.
But that's due to natural predators like vultures that pick them off on a beach or predatory fish that are waiting offshore.
Nature has learned to compensate with that, and females have multiple clutches of eggs to overcome those odds.
But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses, human things, like this picture that shows a leatherback caught at night in a gill net.
And "marble cake" is significant because it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized.
Anonymous is this group of people that protested, very famously, Scientology.
The story is, Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online.
We live in difficult and challenging economic times, of course.
And one of the first victims of difficult economic times, I think, is public spending of any kind, but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science, and particularly curiosity-led science and exploration.
So I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes that that's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do.

But I think to set the scene, I want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED, but it is a bit of a mess.

But actually, it's not my fault; it's from the Guardian newspaper.
And it's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs.
That percentage, by the way, is about the same in the U.S. and Germany and France.
publicly funded, is about 0.6 percent of GDP.
So that's what we're arguing about.
It's of the moon Enceladus.
So that big sweeping, white sphere in the corner is Saturn, which is actually in the background of the picture.
And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus, which is about as big as the British Isles.
It's about 500 kilometers in diameter.
So, tiny moon.
What's fascinating and beautiful ...
So that place, a little moon around Jupiter, is probably the prime candidate for finding life on a moon or a body outside the Earth, that we know of.
Tremendous and beautiful discovery.
Our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful.
A famous picture; many people have said that it's the picture that saved 1968, which was a turbulent year -- the student riots in Paris, the height of the Vietnam War.
The reason many people think that about this picture, and Al Gore has said it many times, actually, on the stage at TED, is that this picture, arguably, was the beginning of the environmental movement.
Because, for the first time, we saw our world, not as a solid, immovable, kind of indestructible place, but as a very small, fragile-looking world just hanging against the blackness of space.

But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum.
And the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element.
And that's why helium's called helium.
It's one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth, is you can transport it, not only to the planets, but to the most distant stars and galaxies.
And one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics, just by looking at the structure of atoms -- the same theory that describes transistors -- is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than, quite specifically, 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.
That's a limit imposed on the mass of stars.
This is about 50 million light years away, so one of our neighboring galaxies.
But that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy.
So that star is also 50 million light years away.
Now that's an incredible phenomena, because it's a star that sits there.
It's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf.
It sits there about, say, 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.

And it has a binary companion that goes around it, so a big star, a big ball of gas.
It sits there about, say, 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.
And it has a binary companion that goes around it, so a big star, a big ball of gas.
And what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star, until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit, and then it explodes.
It can also, I think, finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet.
This is a spectacular picture of our home planet.
Now, it doesn't look like our home planet.
It was taken by this thing, which is called the Voyager spacecraft.
And that's a picture of me in front of it for scale.
The Voyager is a tiny machine.
But it visited Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
And after it visited all four of those planets, Carl Sagan, who's one of my great heroes, had the wonderful idea of turning Voyager around and taking a picture of every planet it had visited.
And it took this picture of Earth.
The argument has always been made, and it will always be made, that we know enough about the universe.
You could have made it in the 1920s; you wouldn't have had penicillin.
You could have made it in the 1890s; you wouldn't have the transistor.
We used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.
They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.
The machine itself would start the music.
The machine itself would start the music.
So the machine would get started, it would travel some distance, reacting along the way, hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback.
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.
So the machine would get started, it would travel some distance, reacting along the way, hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback.
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.
And speaking of synchronization, they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way.
Okay.
So, just some statistics about what we went through in the process.
The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions.
We destroyed two pianos and 10 televisions in the process.
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.
And we lost one high-heeled shoe when one of our engineers, Heather Knight, left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner, and returned back to the build -- and left it in a pile of stuff.
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.
And we lost one high-heeled shoe when one of our engineers, Heather Knight, left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner, and returned back to the build -- and left it in a pile of stuff.
And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use" and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.
And we learned that small stuff stinks.
Little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust, and they fall out of the tracks, the exact angles makes it hard to get right.
And yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.
Most African stories these days, they talk about famine, HIV and AIDS, poverty or war.
But my story that I would like to share with you today is the one about success.
It is about a country in the southwest of Africa called Namibia.
And one day, my father actually took me into the bush.
He said, "John, I want you to become a good herder.
Boy, if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat -- cheetah is very nervous -- just walk up to it.
"And he will let go of the goat and run off."
But then he said, "Boy, if you run into a lion, don't move.
Don't move. Stand your ground.
Nowhere else in the world has community-adopted conservation at this scale.
In 2008, conservancy generated 5.7 million dollars.
This is our new economy -- an economy based on the respect of our natural resources.
In 2008, conservancy generated 5.7 million dollars.
This is our new economy -- an economy based on the respect of our natural resources.
And we are able to use this money for many things: Very importantly, we put it in education.
It actually says garage, funk, rhythm and blues.
You have a series of buttons. You actually choose your lift music.
My guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift in the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm is probably 500 to 1,000 pounds max.
And yet, what behavioral economics shows time after time after time is in human behavioral and behavioral change there's a very, very strong disproportionality at work, that actually what changes our behavior and what changes our attitude to things is not actually proportionate to the degree of expense entailed, or the degree of force that's applied.
But everything about institutions makes them uncomfortable with that disproportionality.
So what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very, very large budget.
Actually, what happens in the world increasingly -- now, all credit to the British Airport Authority.
I spoke about this before, and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said, "Okay, what can you do?"
So I did come up with five suggestions, which they are actually actioning.
And if you think about it, it's very, very important that the strategy myth is maintained.
Because, if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors, it makes the disparity in salaries slightly more justifiable than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company's success might actually lie somewhere else, in small pieces of tactical activity.
But what is happening is that effectively -- and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn't helped this; lots of things haven't helped this -- business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy.
And the second thing, I think, is that the world needs to have people in charge of that.
That's why I call for the "Chief Detail Officer."
Every corporation should have one, and every government should have a Ministry of Detail.
We are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world.
And we are educating our kids, having fewer kids, basically good news all around.
But we move to cities, toward the bright lights, and one of the things that is there that we want, besides jobs, is electricity.
But one day of coal adds up to one hell of a lot of carbon dioxide in a normal one-gigawatt coal-fired plant.
Then what happens to the waste?
The nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don't have underground storage yet.
Then what happens to the waste?
The nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don't have underground storage yet.
It's just as well, because it can stay where it is.

Now if we go to the area, lots is worse than nuclear or wind.
For example, cellulosic ethanol, to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet, this is how much land you would need.
That's cellulosic, second generation biofuels from prairie grass.
MJ: Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first, and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories.
So the other thing is, we don't need nuclear energy.
There's plenty of solar and wind.
Anyone else against?
Man: The last person who was in favor made the premise that we don't have enough alternative renewable resources.
And our "against" proponent up here made it very clear that we actually do.
And it would be a mess in a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral.
In a gothic cathedral, this kind of music is perfect.
It doesn't change key, the notes are long, there's almost no rhythm whatsoever, and the room flatters the music.
It's around the same time, I think it was built around 1776.
People in the audience in these opera houses, when they were built, they used to yell out to one another.
They used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage, just like they do at CBGB's and places like that.
And well, that was an opera experience.
This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself.
And the size of the room is not that big.
But the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there.
This is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional Romantic view.
The Romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion, and then somehow it gets shaped into something.
Oh, sorry.  This particular one that was given to me finds golf balls, especially if you're at a golf course and you check under enough bushes.
Well, under the category of "What's the harm of silly stuff like this?"
this device, the ADE 651, was sold to the Iraqi government for 40,000 dollars apiece.

We find patterns, we make those connections, whether it's Pavlov's dog here associating the sound of the bell with the food, and then he salivates to the sound of the bell, or whether it's a Skinnerian rat, in which he's having an association between his behavior and a reward for it, and therefore he repeats the behavior.
In fact, what Skinner discovered is that, if you put a pigeon in a box like this, and he has to press one of these two keys, and he tries to figure out what the pattern is, and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there -- if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern, they will figure out any kind of pattern.
And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward, they repeat that particular pattern.
And that's called superstition, and that, I'm afraid, we will always have with us.
I call this process "patternicity" -- that is, the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise.
When we do this process, we make two types of errors.
When we do this process, we make two types of errors.
A Type I error, or false positive, is believing a pattern is real when it's not.
Our second type of error is a false negative.
And you hear a rustle in the grass.
Is it a dangerous predator, or is it just the wind?
Your next decision could be the most important one of your life.
Well, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind, you've made an error in cognition, made a Type I error, false positive.
But no harm. You just move away.
You're more cautious. You're more vigilant.
Once I prime the brain -- it's called cognitive priming -- once I prime the brain to see it, it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it.
And what do you see here?
Some people see a Dalmatian dog.
So perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity.
Dopamine, I think, changes our signal-to-noise ratio.
That is, how accurate we are in finding patterns.
Woman: You wouldn't?  Woman: You'd think that was fine.
Girl: That would be fine.  So this is a blind test.
I'm going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on.

So, if you're in the audience today, or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place, you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem.
Whether you're an artist, a technologist, a lawyer or a fan, the handling of copyright directly impacts your life.
And Jill and Kevin, the happy couple, they came back from their honeymoon and found that their video had gone crazy viral.
And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows, and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference.
The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations to end domestic violence.
By empowering choice, we can create a culture of opportunity.
And all it took to change things around was to allow for choice through rights identification.
So why has no one ever solved this problem before?
And I mentioned I'll use some visual representations of sounds.
Here's the first example.
This is a plot of frequency against time -- sort of like musical notation, where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower, and time goes this way.
But all of the time when they separate by more than 100 meters, they need to use these individually distinctive whistles to come back together again.
Most of these distinctive signature whistles are quite stereotyped and stable through the life of a dolphin.
But there are some exceptions.
It had deep underwater microphones, or hydrophones, cabled to shore, all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole North Atlantic.
And after the Berlin Wall fell, the Navy made these systems available to see what they could hear.
This is a plot from Christopher Clark who tracked one individual blue whale as it passed by Bermuda, went down to the latitude of Miami and came back again.
And this orange line here marks the typical songs of east coast humpbacks.
In '95 they all sang the normal song.
But in '96 they heard a few weird songs, and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales.
And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen.
We have the ability to get those groups of people around us that want to kind of build that dream with us, and I think if we could get kids to embrace the idea at a young age of being entrepreneurial, we could change everything in the world that is a problem today.
Every problem that's out there, somebody has the idea for.
It's probably why I'm a little bit panicked right now -- other than all the caffeine that I've had and the sugar -- but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur.
Attention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder.
Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease?
Attention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder.
Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease?
Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.
It had our university logo on it.
You know we teach our kids and we buy them games, but why don't we get them games, if they're entrepreneurial kids, that kind of nurture the traits that you need to be entrepreneurs?
Why don't you teach them not to waste money?
Don't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder unless it is really, really freaking bad.
The same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression, unless it is so clinically brutal, man.
Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease.
But how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well?
Because there's huge opportunities in that.
I want to close with a quick little video.
I want to close with a quick little video.
It's a video that was done by one of the companies that I mentor.
These guys, Grasshopper.
Her first job was at an inner-city motel in San Francisco as a maid.
I happened to buy that motel about three months after Vivian started working there.
So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.
Time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world.
And yet, of course, that little intangible piece of data doesn't factor into our GDP calculations.
As I spent my week up in the Himalayas, I started to imagine what I call an emotional equation.
I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote, and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here.
This is a collection of things that Robert Kennedy said in that quote.
GDP counts everything from air pollution to the destruction of our redwoods.
So where my work as a graphic designer was to follow strategy, my work now follows my heart and my interests with the guidance of my ego to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client.
Now, this is heresy in the design world.
The ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design.
But then as well, I was able to just flip them, rotate them and combine them in different ways to create either regular patterns or abstract patterns.
So here's the word puzzle again.
And here it is with the abstract surrounding.
And for that same amount of time, I've been spilling sugar on the table and just kind of playing with it with my fingers.
And eventually I used this technique to create a piece of artwork.
And then I used it again to create six pieces for Stefan's book, "Things in My Life I've Learned So Far."
And I started by doing just a single image like this and sending them out to each person.
But in 2007, I got the cockamamie idea to hand-draw each valentine for everyone on my mailing list.
I reduced my mailing list to 150 people.
So a piece of mine may inspire a playwright or a novelist or a scientist, and that in turn may be the seed that inspires a doctor or a philanthropist or a babysitter.
And this isn't something that you can quantify or track or measure, and we tend to undervalue things in society that we can't measure.
But I really believe that a fully operating, rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing.

And they have absolutely amazing education systems.
So we all troop off to Finland, and we wonder at the social democratic miracle of Finland and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it, and then we struggle to imagine how we might bring lessons back.
Well, so, for this last year, with the help of Cisco who sponsored me, for some balmy reason, to do this, I've been looking somewhere else.
So the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain.
They are to stay alive, to earn a living, to not become HIV positive.
The one technology that spans rich and poor in places like this is not anything to do with industrial technology.
And he was finally brought back into school, not by the offer of GCSEs, but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter, a practical making skill.
So the trendiest schools in the world, High Tech High and others, they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity.
Here, there isn't really an option.

And finally, they have a different model of scale, and it's a Chinese restaurant model of how to scale.
He's actually a trade union organizer by background, and that's how he learned the skills to build his organization.
When they got to a certain stage, Pratham got big enough to attract some pro bono support from McKinsey.
McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said, "You know what you should do with this, Madhav?
Why can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants?"
There are Chinese restaurants everywhere, but there is no Chinese restaurant chain.
Yet, everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant.

They know what to expect, even though it'll be subtly different and the colors will be different and the name will be different.
Every child up to the age of 15 who wants a place in school will be able to have one in 2015.
It's an amazing thing.
But it is, unlike cars, which have developed so rapidly and orderly, actually the school system is recognizably an inheritance from the 19th century, from a Bismarkian model of German schooling that got taken up by English reformers, and often by religious missionaries, taken up in the United States as a force of social cohesion, and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed.

When I was 10 years old, a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.
That stuff's cool."
Walked into the Lego store.
Bought him this.
If only there was a way to automate this."
And two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said, "We could do that," and in 72 hours, they launched Ushahidi.
Ushahidi -- the name means "witness" or "testimony" in Swahili -- is a very simple way of taking reports from the field, whether it's from the web or, critically, via mobile phones and SMS, aggregating it and putting it on a map.
And the interesting moment now, the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true.
That is the resource that I'm talking about.
I call it cognitive surplus.
Sometimes, it's all at once.
This is another infill project on the parking lots, this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.
When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site, the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new Main Street, several apartments and condo buildings, while keeping the existing office buildings.

Here is the site in 1940: It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville.
that's really history.
So here it is at projected build-out.
This project, I think, has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods.
It's very successful, and it's helped to prompt -- eight of the 13 regional malls in Denver have now, or have announced plans to be, retrofitted.
But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring -- just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city.
No, it's pockets of walkability on the sites of under-performing properties.
Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us: molecules like PCBs that can't be broken down by our bodies.
And they go in the base of that pyramid, and they drift up; they're passed up that way, on to predators and on to the top predators, and in so doing, they accumulate.
Now, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.

We don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.
The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.
But there's a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working ecosystems.
They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.
Thank you very much.
Please excuse me for sitting; I'm very old.
Well, the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar because it's very old.

Well, the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar because it's very old.
Roughness is part of human life forever and forever, and ancient authors have written about it.
Others of them are very real, in a certain sense.
Now this is the real. It's a cauliflower.
Now why do I show a cauliflower, a very ordinary and ancient vegetable?
Now this is the real. It's a cauliflower.
Now why do I show a cauliflower, a very ordinary and ancient vegetable?
Because old and ancient as it may be, it's very complicated and it's very simple, both at the same time.
That one can measure roughness by a number, a number, 2.3, 1.2 and sometimes much more.
One day, a friend of mine, to bug me, brought a picture and said, "What is the roughness of this curve?"
I said, "Well, just short of 1.5."
Enormous disagreements.
Why so? Because, in fact, the area of the lung is something very ill-defined.
The bronchi branch, branch, branch and they stop branching, not because of any matter of principle, but because of physical considerations: the mucus, which is in the lung.
One of the shattering events in the history of mathematics, which is not appreciated by many people, occurred about 130 years ago, 145 years ago.
Mathematicians began to create shapes that didn't exist.
Mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing, that man can invent things that nature did not know.
And so here I had this theory, and I wrote books about it -- financial prices increments.
To the left you see data over a long period.
To the right, on top, you see a theory which is very, very fashionable.
And we thought, God, this is such a good idea and it's going to raise so much money.
So we said screw it, we'll just start our own company, which we did three years ago.
So that was kind of my first dream, was to start this company called FEED, and here's a screenshot of our website.
And when you think about food, the underpinning of food in both cases is potentially problematic agriculture.
And agriculture is where food comes from.
Well, agriculture in America's very interesting.
They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes.
There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up.
And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world, which we still use linguistically when we talk about "the West" and "the Developing World."
This will not happen [again].
The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world -- nothing more, nothing less.
But it's a very important role.
And now I mainly write books about how the ocean is changing, and the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly.
Now we saw this kind of graphic earlier on, that we really live on a hard marble that has just a slight bit of wetness to it.
It's like you dipped a marble in water.
We're warming the climate.
So the blowout in the Gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization.
Beyond warming, we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified -- and already measurably so, and already affecting animals.

Beyond warming, we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified -- and already measurably so, and already affecting animals.
Now in the laboratory, if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is -- not 8.1, which is the normal pH of seawater -- but 7.5, it dissolves in about three days.

But as many people have said, there's a large attempt to suppress what's going on.
Personally, I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body, because we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene.
But you can see it.
They don't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway.
But these are really high-performance athletic animals.
I don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills.
There was nothing ready, and, you know, as we can see by what they're doing.
Mainly what they're doing is booms and dispersants.
The booms are absolutely not made for open water.
And you'd have some idea of what to do.
That's certainly one of the things we need to do.
But I think we have to understand where this leak really started from.
Ever since we lived in caves, every time we wanted any energy, we lit something on fire, and that is still what we're doing.
We're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy.
And people say we can't have clean energy because it's too expensive.
People who sell us fossil fuels.
We've been here before with energy, and people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch, because the cheapest energy was slavery.
Energy is always a moral issue.
My body's an accumulation of ideas too: the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells.
They've come together.
How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?
That is prosperity, the saving of time in satisfying your needs.
Ask yourself how long you would have to work to provide for yourself an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by.
If you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside.

You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.
They traded them with their neighbors for things like stingray barbs, and the consequence was that stone axes ended up over a large part of Australia.
So long-distance movement of tools is a sign of trade, not migration.
What happens when you cut people off from exchange, from the ability to exchange and specialize?
It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego -- similar island, similar people.
The reason: because Tierra del Fuego is separated from South America by a much narrower straight, and there was trading contact across that straight throughout 10,000 years.
The Tasmanians were isolated.

Go back to this image again and ask yourself, not only who made it and for who, but who knew how to make it.
He just knows how to run a company.
The person on the assembly line doesn't know because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic, and so on.
We all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole.
Narrator: A word about Galvao, a very rare kind of bird native to Brazil.
Every year, more than 300,000 Galvao birds are killed during Carnival parades.
Ethan Zuckerman: Obviously, this is a tragic situation, and it actually gets worse.
It's all right there.
When you start looking at what actually flows on top of these networks, you get a very different picture.
You start looking at how the global plane flights move, and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat.
When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible, and we look at what actually happens, we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way that we think it does.
So here's the problem that I've been interested in in the last decade or so.
The world is, in fact, getting more global.
So if I found myself in the NFL, I suspect I would spend my off-season nursing my wounds, enjoying my house, so on and so forth -- possibly recording a hip-hop album.
Dhani Jones, who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals, has a slightly different approach to the off-season.
Dhani has a television show.
On the other hand was my grandmother, who also took care of me and was more spiritual, less educated and definitely less rational.
This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye.
Many people visited my grandmother, people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands.
Yet as much as I love stories, recently, I've also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story.
And this is a subject that I would love to think about together.
When my first novel written in English came out in America, I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity.
He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book because I happened to be one.
We often talk about how stories change the world, but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated, read and reviewed.
But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction.
It was just a story.
And when I say, "just a story," I'm not trying to belittle my work.
Today, stories continue to transcend borders.
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk, they usually don't listen to each other, but a Palestinian reader still reads a novel by a Jewish author, and vice versa, connecting and empathizing with the narrator.
Literature has to take us beyond.
Prior to 2004, Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years.
He was a soft dictator of Kenya.
And when Kibaki got into power -- through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya -- they commissioned this report, spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report.
It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism.
So I went there in 2007, and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election -- the national election, December 28.
When we released that report, we did so three days after the new president, Kibaki, had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out, Daniel arap Moi, so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki's neck.
What would you say to that?
JA: Yeah, we do get a lot of that.
But remember, the people in Baghdad, the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan -- they don't need to see the video; they see it every day.
But remember, the people in Baghdad, the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan -- they don't need to see the video; they see it every day.
So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception.
That's what they see every day.
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up.
So under that basis, we put it out and said, "Look, we're skeptical about this thing.
We don't know, but what can we do?
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up.
So under that basis, we put it out and said, "Look, we're skeptical about this thing.

And we were like, "Oh, tell us more.
What document is it, precisely, you're talking about?
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document?
So you have to be careful with hacker.
I mean there's like -- there's a method that can be deployed for various things.
Unfortunately, at the moment, it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts.
And when I see pictures like this, of parents or uncles who think it's cute to have a little child holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them to protest something, the hope is by linking enough positive things to the Koran, that one day we can move this child from being proud in the way they're proud there, to that.
And I think -- I think The 99 can and will achieve its mission.
As an undergrad at Tufts University, we were giving away free falafel one day and, you know, it was Middle East Day or something.
Just today, D.C. Comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover.
On that cover you see Batman, Superman and a fully-clothed Wonder Woman with our Saudi member of The 99, our Emirati member and our Libyan member.
On April 26, 2010, President Barack Obama said that of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech -- in which he reached out to the Muslim world -- the most innovative was that The 99 reach back out to the Justice League of America.
Let's start with the old Copernican question: Are there earths around other stars?
And as we already heard, there is a way in which we are trying, and now able, It's a new telescope.
Our team, befittingly I think, named it after one of those dreamers of the Copernican time, Johannes Kepler, and that telescope's sole purpose is to go out, find the planets that orbit other stars in our galaxy, and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth happen to be out there.
That's not why I'm here.
Why I'm here is to tell you that the next step is really the exciting part.
The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next.
And here comes biology -- biology, with its basic question, which still stands unanswered, which is essentially: "If there is life on other planets, do we expect it to be like life on Earth?"
And let me immediately tell you here, when I say life, I don't mean "dolce vita," good life, human life.
I really mean life on Earth, past and present, from microbes to us humans, in its rich molecular diversity, the way we now understand life on Earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions -- and we call that, collectively, biochemistry, life as a chemical process, as a chemical phenomenon.
And let me immediately tell you here, when I say life, I don't mean "dolce vita," good life, human life.
I really mean life on Earth, past and present, from microbes to us humans, in its rich molecular diversity, the way we now understand life on Earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions -- and we call that, collectively, biochemistry, life as a chemical process, as a chemical phenomenon.
So the question is: is that chemical phenomenon universal, or is it something which depends on the planet?
Let's think of life as that entire planet because, in a sense, it is.
The biosphere is the size of the Earth.
Life on Earth is the size of the Earth.
Think about those oldest living things on Earth, but in a cosmic proportion.
This is not insignificant.
This is very significant.


Up until now, our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms.
And on top of that, these systems actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars.
So with that, I'd like to invite onstage Evan Grant, who is one of last year's speakers, who's kindly agreed to help me to demonstrate what we've been able to develop.
So the device that you see is a 14-channel, high-fidelity EEG acquisition system.
So the device that you see is a 14-channel, high-fidelity EEG acquisition system.
It doesn't require any scalp preparation, no conductive gel or paste.
It only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle.
There's not enough young, healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us.
And the tissue's very expensive.
And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue.

And the tissue's very expensive.
And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue.
So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people, we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope.
So my story in working with animal tissues starts in 1984.
And I started first with cow Achilles tendon, where we would take the cow Achilles tendon, which is type-I collagen, strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template.

And I started first with cow Achilles tendon, where we would take the cow Achilles tendon, which is type-I collagen, strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template.
We would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient's knee.
So in that case, I have to design -- and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek -- to wash away, or strip, those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme.
And we call that a "gal stripping" technique.
What we do is humanize the tissue.
So what we're going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young, healthy pig, strip it of its antigens, load it with your stem cells, then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee, tack it on there, have you heal that surface and then create a new biologic surface for your knee.
So that's our biologic approach right now.
We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts.
"I understand," I said, "that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea, but I'd like to put some sugar in my green tea."
Surprised by my insistence, the waiter took up the issue with the manager.
Pretty soon, a lengthy discussion ensued, and finally the manager came over to me and said, "I am very sorry. We do not have sugar."
At times they don't even hold true at America's own borders.
I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions and the problems associated with them.
As I do so, I hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds.
When, in contrast, two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected, then they may amplify one another's success by turning choosing into a collective act.
To insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships.
Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands.
To insist that they choose independently might actually compromise both their performance and their relationships.
Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands.
It leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.
They practice this from such an early age that they've come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability.
In fact, though all humans share a basic need and desire for choice, we don't all see choice in the same places or to the same extent.
When someone can't see how one choice is unlike another, or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast, the process of choosing can be confusing and frustrating.
When someone can't see how one choice is unlike another, or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast, the process of choosing can be confusing and frustrating.
Instead of making better choices, we become overwhelmed by choice, sometimes even afraid of it.
Choice no longer offers opportunities, but imposes constraints.
We live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images, by the idea with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria, which is our actual experience."
The story Americans tell, the story upon which the American dream depends, is the story of limitless choice.
This narrative promises so much: freedom, happiness, success.

It lays the world at your feet and says, "You can have anything, everything."
And they're dying off rather regularly, tens of thousands around the world.
It's predicted they may go extinct -- about a third of them -- within about 30 years.
So my project is along the Northwest Atlantic.
Well, you know, we got into this in the beginning as a trade-off, they say, between the wetlands versus the ocean depth.
And I didn't agree with that decision at the time; I still don't.
The decision was to protect the marshes.
It's gotten much more aggressive.
This is an Exxon slide showing what happens, the scenario and the trade-off.
So this shows oil on the surface.
The surfactants -- which are like things we use on fast food wrappers -- they grab around the droplets of oil, and they make little, tiny droplets with nice, little surfactant edges to them.
The thing to remember about the micelles -- these little floating globules of toxin -- is they are there to deliver.
They're like the FedEx guys.
Oil contains hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds and other compounds that are toxic to every organ in the body.
And so with the dispersants combined, you have this very synergistic combined toxicity.
Corexit also contains petroleum solvents and many other toxic compounds.
So what scientists do when they begin is to start with the system.
They define what the system is.
The system isn't Chesapeake Bay.
They define what the system is.
The system isn't Chesapeake Bay.
It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific.
Mountain ranges, plate tectonics, moves the continents around, forms ore deposits.
Volcanoes erupt.
That's the planet that we live on.
Of course, that's when we hit a sort second problem -- a little bit more methodological -- which is that, maybe you guys don't know, but monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.
But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff.
So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.


Last year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole.
And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible.
And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up, listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy, and then committing myself a hundred percent -- there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind -- and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water.
And that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds, and it felt like 18 days.
28 great, big, powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain -- I don't just have my Speedo, but there's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world.
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude.
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.
This is where we stand today.
A lot of people like to point to some place else as the cause of the problem.
It's always population growth.
We don't have to change the way a single Chinese company works if we get Cargill to only send sustainable palm oil to China.
It's a pre-competitive issue.
All the palm oil going there is good.



Milo: I could just squish it.
Peter Molyneux: What are you going to do, Dimitri?
Female Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important, but remember, even this choice will affect how Milo develops.
Female Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important, but remember, even this choice will affect how Milo develops.
Do you want Milo to squash it?
When you see the microphone, say ...  ... yes to decide.
Dimitri: Go on, Milo. Squash it.
PM: No. That's the wrong thing to do.
Now look at his response.
Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging -- he's got to go to school.
The cool thing is that we're doing as well: as you interact with him, you're able to put things into his world; he recognizes objects.
His mind is based in a cloud.
In five countries, in just under a month, we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live.
We had millions see them on TV and on TV news.
In Jordan, we had His Majesty the King come and see them.
He says, "You wait. I'll be back," and he walked away.
And I started freaking out, because I don't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into.
Thought the guy was going to come back and be like, "We've been looking for you for 200 years."
I went down. I go, "Where's my son?"
"On the third floor, sir. On the third floor."
"You take a taxi. You go to Zara. Make a left."
But this is sort of the important stages in which that framework will get built, and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now.
Just before we jump into that, there's sort of a question of: why is this important?
I'm sort of making this claim that there is a game layer on top of the world, and that it's very important that we build it properly.
I'm sort of making this claim that there is a game layer on top of the world, and that it's very important that we build it properly.
The reason that it's so important is that, the last decade, what we've seen has been building the social layer, has been this framework for connections, and construction on that layer is over, it's finished.
There's still a lot to explore.
I like it quite a lot.
They've created this thing called the Open Graph, and they own all of our connections.
They own half a billion people.
And this is simply an appointment dynamic.
Come here at a certain time, get your drinks half off.
To win, all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time.
To win, all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time.
This game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our behavior, it's influenced our entire culture.
That's a really scary thought, that one game dynamic can change things so powerfully.
Why April?
Well, in April 1999 was the Columbine shooting, and since then, that fear has been remembered by the media and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year.
You have retrospectives, anniversaries, court cases, even copy-cat shootings, all pushing that fear into the agenda.

And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it?
And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it?
See that gap there? There's a gap, and it affects all the other stories.
Why is there a gap there?
Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights, and it's all around us, and it can be mined very easily.
It's not a particularly great metaphor in these times, especially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico, but I would, perhaps, adapt this metaphor slightly, and I would say that data is the new soil.
Because for me, it feels like a fertile, creative medium.
Over the years, online, we've laid down a huge amount of information and data, and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity, and it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments.
And, all right, I'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit.
But it's a really fertile medium, and it feels like visualizations, infographics, data visualizations, they feel like flowers blooming from this medium.

But it's a really fertile medium, and it feels like visualizations, infographics, data visualizations, they feel like flowers blooming from this medium.
It's almost like being exposed to all this media over the years had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me.
And I don't feel like I'm unique.
I feel that everyday, all of us now are being blasted by information design.
I was curious about this, so it led me to the work of a Danish physicist called Tor Norretranders, and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms.
So here we go. This is your senses, pouring into your senses every second.
Your sense of sight is the fastest.
So a lot of your vision -- the bulk of it is visual, and it's pouring in.
It's unconscious.
The eye is exquisitely sensitive to patterns in variations in color, shape and pattern.
So heart is filtered out, so I can see if I'm curious about that.
I think, "No, no. I don't want to take any synthetics, I just want to see plants and -- just show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients."
Now this app is spawning itself from the data.
Doosh! Again, the image recreates itself.
So it's cool.
It's kind of living.
It's kind of living.
But it can go beyond data, and it can go beyond numbers.
I like to apply information visualization to ideas and concepts.
But it can go beyond data, and it can go beyond numbers.
I like to apply information visualization to ideas and concepts.
This is a visualization of the political spectrum, an attempt for me to try and understand how it works and how the ideas percolate down from government into society and culture, into families, into individuals, into their beliefs and back around again in a cycle.
Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it.
The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent sags below sea level, beneath its weight.
Yet, the ice of Antarctica is a calendar of climate change.
Antarctica was this planet's last empty quarter -- the blind spot in our expanding vision of the world.
Early explorers sailed off the edge of the map, and they found a place where the normal rules of time and temperature seem suspended.
Here, the ice seems a living presence.
Eventually, my mom took the red crayon away, so it was [unclear].
But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently, and it's become the foundation of my work because, I feel like, if in a day, I can see the ocean differently, then I can evoke that same kind of change in others, especially kids.
Before that day, this is how I saw the ocean.
So if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like, that's what a dinosaur looks like.
So you have living dinosaurs and space aliens, animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions.
It's just incredible; no Hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that.
He can't spin a web anytime; he's got to pull his pants down first.
Or the blowfish.
The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk.
I couldn't fit them in.
So what I did was I made an adventure strip.
Basically, this bottle travels a long way.
What I'm trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn't really go away; it just continues to wash downstream.
And a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean, which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it, especially if they can't stand each other, like these two.
So, I sent them to Boise, Idaho, where they dropped a plastic bottle into the Boise sewer system.
And you take the piece out into the daylight.
And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster.
So you say to yourself, "Well, that's worth something."
We're four percent of the world's population; we use 25 percent of the world's oil production.
And we don't really understand what oil is, until you check out its molecules, And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn.
So this is what happens as that burn gets going.
So there it is; the retinas are baking.
Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil.
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules.
They're very important in oil spills.
Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water.
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous.
Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water.
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous.
Oil doesn't sink, it floats.

Oil doesn't sink, it floats.
If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.
Oil doesn't sink, it floats.
If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water.
It also makes it very viscous.
When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain, there were big, floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil, with the consistency, or the viscosity, of chewing gum.
It's incredibly hard to clean up.
I mean, these pictures -- this is from the Santa Barbara spill.
You have these pictures of birds.
They really influence people.

When the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969, it formed the environmental movement in its modern form.

When the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969, it formed the environmental movement in its modern form.
It started Earth Day.
We were very reactive, as opposed to being proactive about what happened.
And so what we did was, actually, we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling.
We stopped drilling in ANWR, but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed.
We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law: "The force equals mass times acceleration."
This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign.
But if we rearrange this formula quickly, we can get to acceleration equals force over mass, which means that for a larger particle -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction.
So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures.
Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?
Getting a little more technical now.

So this says that it's impossible, by definition, to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position -- and the momentum of a particle, because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.
Getting a little more technical now.
So this says that it's impossible, by definition, to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position -- and the momentum of a particle, because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.
So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it, then the photon of light has momentum, which knocks the particle, so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.

Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.
So luckily, the science -- no, sorry -- the marketing is getting easier.
Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking, more digital media consumption, you can measure more what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they do.
Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking, more digital media consumption, you can measure more what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they do.
So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle, because the observation changes it.
The marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do.

The marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do.
So next, the scientific method -- an axiom of physics, of all science -- says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation, you can only disprove it.
It was, for a long time, revered as the most reliable of cars, and then they had the big recall incident.
And Tiger Woods, for a long time, the perfect brand ambassador.
Well, you know the story.
And we have not thought enough about the solutions.
We've used fear, if you like, to grab people's attention.
And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism.
It's asking people, what do they want.
And unsurprisingly, people all around the world say that what they want is happiness, for themselves, for their families, their children, their communities.
Okay, they think money is slightly important.
And what we do, is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet.
But we have to remember that there's a fundamental input to that, and that is how many of the planet's resources we use.

But we have to remember that there's a fundamental input to that, and that is how many of the planet's resources we use.
We all have one planet. We all have to share it.
And they have that Latin vibe, don't they.
They have the social connectedness.
The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about -- is that the future might not be North American, might not be Western European.
Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday, or American used yesterday?
Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions?
That's how you create a collective goal.

We live on a human-dominated planet, putting unprecedented pressure on the systems on Earth.
This is bad news, but perhaps surprising to you, it's also part of the good news.
A thousand years into this period, we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns.
We go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today.
The Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture, we domesticate animals and plants.
We go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today.
The Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture, we domesticate animals and plants.
You have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it.
No scientist could predict that in 2007, suddenly, what could be crossing a threshold.
The system suddenly, very surprisingly, loses 30 to 40 percent of its summer ice cover.
And the drama is, of course, that when the system does this, the logic may change.
Now, what about the future?
Well, the future, of course, has one massive challenge, which is feeding a world of nine billion people.
We need nothing less than a new green revolution, and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink.


Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal.
So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo, but I do know the fungus is down there.
And then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree.
So that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood is the mycelial felt of the fungus, and what it's doing -- it's actually slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients.
Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is -- any guesses?
Rachel Sussman: 300? No, 175 is the oldest living tortoise, so nowhere near 2,000.
And then, you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached 405 years old.
So the Baobabs, as they get older, tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out.
And this can create great natural shelters for animals, but they've also been appropriated for some rather dubious human uses, including a bar, a prison and even a toilet inside of a tree.
And this brings me to another favorite of mine -- I think, because it is just so unusual.

This plant is called the Welwitschia, and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola, where it's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea.
I started in 1999 to try and address this problem with an experiment, which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi.
I basically embedded a computer into a wall of a slum in New Delhi.
The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English -- they'd never seen a computer before, and they didn't know what the internet was.

The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English -- they'd never seen a computer before, and they didn't know what the internet was.
At that point, I became a little more ambitious and decided to see what else could children do with a computer.
We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad, India, where I gave a group of children -- they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent.
I gave them a computer with a speech-to-text interface, which you now get free with Windows, and asked them to speak into it.
SM: And I asked him, "Do you send emails?"
And he said, "Yes, and they hop across the ocean."
This is in Cambodia, rural Cambodia -- a fairly silly arithmetic game, which no child would play inside the classroom or at home.
This is in Cambodia, rural Cambodia -- a fairly silly arithmetic game, which no child would play inside the classroom or at home.
They would, you know, throw it back at you.
They'd say, "This is very boring."
SM: So you know what's happened?
I think we've just stumbled across a self-organizing system.
A self-organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside.
If you travel in Indian trains, you can see people listening to radio and, you know, even from their mobiles.
So at that time -- and I was 13 -- and I was listening to just radio, and someone happened to sit next to me, like these three people are sitting here.
You know, like just adjacent to me.
So at that time -- and I was 13 -- and I was listening to just radio, and someone happened to sit next to me, like these three people are sitting here.
You know, like just adjacent to me.
He just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?"
So this work is nothing but like -- because of the focal length of the lens, it just shows what is on the other side.
So I just put the paper on the focal length, which was an etching print, then I got the portrait of [the] sun from sunlight.
This is called "Dawn to Dawn."
It's just created by the mind.
If you look at this piece of paper, this is the breadth and this is called length.
This is how we've been taught in school.
So this is after a few weeks, this is after a few months.
It's just all about questioning the preconceptions.
So if someone says, "Oh, I see the portrait," it may not be the portrait after a few months.
I said, "No, mom. It can't be.
Because we can create a sculpture by gathering dust together, or we can break the sculpture and get the dust, but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe."
So, I did this work for her.
That evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture [the] invisible.
So what you see now is called "Shadow Foreshadow."
And what I'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too; we see the source of the light.
So what you see now is called "Shadow Foreshadow."
And what I'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too; we see the source of the light.
We see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.
And what I'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too; we see the source of the light.
We see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark, but it's filled with light all the time.
And what I'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too; we see the source of the light.
We see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark, but it's filled with light all the time.
So my request was like, is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign?
And to really get to the point, we should move beyond, you know, go to the other side of the wall, like illogic, like are invisible.
Because when we see someone walks, we see the footprint.
And funnily enough, they were frustrated about that.
Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration.
It wasn't the only reason, and life is not simple, one reason narratives.
Now, West Antarctica is the part of the continent where the ice is grounded on sea floor as much as 2,000 meters deep.
So that ice sheet is partly floating, and it's exposed to the ocean, to the ocean heat.
This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about.
This was completely unexpected.
Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was this dynamic.
In fact, the lore for many years has been, "The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago, and it's been there ever since."
It's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony.
And it's covered with algae. That's what happens.
When these things die, immediately, organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface.
It's 11 meters in diameter, and we know that it started growing in the year 1584.
Imagine that.
And that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters, until 1954, when the earthquake happened.
But they all tell us what the natural variability is.
Some of them are from the northern hemisphere; some are from the entire globe.
But here's what we can say: what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down.
You need clear, open visibility of what the best people in that crowd are capable of, because that is how you will learn how you will be empowered to participate.
And third, you need desire.
You know, innovation's hard work.
So, this is a model that pretty much any organization could use to try and nurture its own cycle of crowd-accelerated innovation.
Invite the crowd, let in the light, dial up the desire.
And the hardest part about that is probably the light, because it means you have to open up, you have to show your stuff to the world.
Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness, light and then darkness.
And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light.
These are chemical clocks, and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell.

I'll give you an example -- if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach, and you fly it all the way across the continent, and you drop it into a sloped cage, it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores, and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away.
It'll do this for weeks, until it kind of gradually loses the plot.
And it's incredible to watch, but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on; it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it.
So, we have this ability as well.
They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks.
And so, in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks, rather than somehow sensing the day outside.
So fine, we have a body clock, and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives.
The second string is a melody string, which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.
And the third string is pretty innovative.
It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique.
Fine bone china -- this is a real classic.
Of course, the bone in fine-bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength, in order to make these really fine shapes, like this deer.
In interior decorating, the pig's actually quite there.
It's actually a very low-tech and very high-tech product at the same time.
The low-tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve mounted in the high-tech bit, which is a memory metal casing.
And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery.
And so it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened as England switched to tea and coffee.
But the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important is the architecture of the space.
It was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds, different fields of expertise, and share.
One of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know, by getting modern neonatal incubators into any context, if we can keep premature babies warm, basically -- it's very simple -- we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments.
So, the technology is there.
These are standard in all the industrialized worlds.
And Darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had, every little hunch.
And what Gruber found was that Darwin had the full theory of natural selection for months and months and months before he had his alleged epiphany, reading Malthus in October of 1838.
There are passages where you can read it, and you think you're reading from a Darwin textbook, from the period before he has this epiphany.
And that is actually how great ideas often happen; they fade into view over long periods of time.
Now the challenge for all of us is: how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life, right?
It's hard to go to your boss and say, "I have an excellent idea for our organization.
You have half of an idea, somebody else has the other half, and if you're in the right environment, they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts.
So, in a sense, we often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property, you know, building barricades, having secretive R&D labs, patenting everything that we have, so that those ideas will remain valuable, and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas, and the culture will be more innovative.
But I think there's a case to be made that we should spend at least as much time, if not more, valuing the premise of connecting ideas and not just protecting them.
And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave reception, and he's got a little antennae set up with an amplifier in his office.
And so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office, and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking, as we might call it now.
And after a couple of hours, they actually start picking up the signal, because the Soviets made Sputnik very easy to track.
And so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office, and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking, as we might call it now.
And after a couple of hours, they actually start picking up the signal, because the Soviets made Sputnik very easy to track.
It was right at 20 MHz, so you could pick it up really easily, because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax, basically.
So these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal, and people start kind of coming into the office and saying, "Wow, that's pretty cool. Can I hear? Wow, that's great."
And before long, they think, "Well jeez, this is kind of historic.
We may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this.
So we're thinking, we could throw up a bunch of satellites and use it to track our submarines and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean.
Could you work on that problem?"
And that's how GPS was born.
This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines.
So the mothers who work for us, they come from the communities in which they work.
They're hired -- they're paid as professional members of the health care teams, just like doctors and nurses.
And so doctors and nurses who need to try to change people's behaviors don't have the skills, don't have the time -- our mentor mothers do.
And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in, we can do that.
I started the program in Capetown, South Africa back in 2001.
Because you see, on the one hand, there is the digital world and no question, many things are happening there right now.
And for us humans, it's not quite material, it's not really there -- it's virtual.
On the other hand, we humans, we live in a physical world.
We shift the gravitational center of it.
For example, we can augment digital content with physical mass.
So you move around the content on a display, but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device.

Another thing it's good for is navigation -- it can guide you around in a city.
As humans, we are social, we are empathic, and that's great.
Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive?
Think of a hamster in the pocket.

Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right -- I don't have to check it.
Let me show you the living mobile phone.
So, once again, mobile phone-shaped box, but this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat, and it feels very organic.
Let me show you the living mobile phone.

Oh now, missed call, a new call, new girlfriend maybe -- very exciting.  How do we calm it down?
The loudest sound you can hear is a trillion times more powerful than that.
Ears are made not for hearing, but for listening.
Listening is an active skill, whereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at -- it's a relationship with sound.
For example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions, places you can listen from?
Here are two of them.
Reductive listening is listening "for."
He's saying, "Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next."
That's the way we talk, right guys?
Expansive listening, on the other hand, is listening "with," not listening "for."
So, we're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us.
I think there's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in schizophonia.
The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression.
If you can't do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you.
Sound design is the future, and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds.
I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities, eight ways sound can improve health.

First, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy; it's also now being used to treat cancer.
Lithotripsy -- saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound.
Sound healing is a wonderful modality.
They were making detailed journals of their spending, their mood, their symptoms, their treatments.
Now, we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle -- the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices, the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing, and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors.
This little black dot there is a 3D accelerometer.
Now, we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle -- the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices, the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing, and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors.
This little black dot there is a 3D accelerometer.
It tracks your movement through space.
Here's a biometric device: a pair of Apple Earbuds.
Last year, Apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation, heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds.
What is this for?

I'd like to tell you that it's also for self-knowledge.
Let's zoom in on one synapse, and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron.
You should see small circles -- these are called vesicles.
They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter.
And that's just a mouse brain -- it's a lot smaller than a human brain.
So when show my friends this, sometimes they've told me, "You know, Sebastian, you should just give up.
Neuroscience is hopeless."
It will take the work of generations to succeed.
At the present time, my collaborators and I, what we're aiming for is much more modest -- just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain.
But even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that I am my connectome.
Without it, the water would not know in which direction to flow.
And with the stream, I would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity.
Neural activity is constantly changing.
And donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads.
Military collect weapons, and depression stays intact.
Why?
To compensate this loss of inner control, they try to control the outside, very understandably -- mostly the family -- and unfortunately, this fits very well into the traditional side, regressive side, repressive side, restrictive side of the cultural context.
So, husbands start beating wives, mothers and fathers beat their children, and afterward, they feel awful.
They did not want to do this, it just happened -- they lost control.
So I believe this kept me running.
And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation.
And also -- I think -- without psycho-social therapy, and without considering this in all humanitarian projects, we cannot build-up civil societies.
We had relay races with condoms, we had children's condom-blowing championship.
And before long, the condom was know as the girl's best friend.
In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it -- so the condom is the girl's best friend.
If you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy.
If you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us."
And that was run by them.

The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.
So, that was done.
The money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting.
Yet, after just a few weeks of use, you'll throw this material in the trash.
And this isn't just found in packaging.
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year, in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops.
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year, in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops.

And that's not the only place it's found.

Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment -- on the side of the road or next to a river.

If it's not picked up by a human, like me and you, it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years.
Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years.
This is crazy.
But nature provides us with a really good model here.
This is crazy.
But nature provides us with a really good model here.
When a tree's done using its leaves -- its solar collectors, these amazing molecular photon capturing devices -- at the end of a season, it doesn't pack them up, take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves.
How much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets?
And here in my chart -- on the left-hand side is where we are now.
This is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment.
But the materiality matters too, because in every society that anthropologists have looked at, material stuff operates as a kind of language -- a language of goods, a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories -- stories, for example, about how important we are.
Status-driven, conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty.
And here, all of a sudden, we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic -- the economic institutions, and who we are as people, locked together to drive an engine of growth.
Adam Smith, 200 years ago, spoke about our desire for a life without shame.
A life without shame: in his day, what that meant was a linen shirt, and today, well, you still need the shirt, but you need the hybrid car, the HDTV, two holidays a year in the sun, the netbook and iPad, the list goes on -- an almost inexhaustible supply of goods, driven by this anxiety.
And even if we don't want them, we need to buy them, because, if we don't buy them, the system crashes.
Bluefin are in cave paintings in France.
They're on coins that date back 3,000 years.
This fish was revered by humankind.
We're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot.
The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it's difficult to go to sea.
It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf, the entire Pacific realm.
What do they like to eat?
What is it that they're happy with?
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin -- it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.
What is it that they're happy with?
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin -- it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.
And then, better yet, we've got our own version of tuna whisperers, our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton, who can take a big tuna and in one motion, put it into an envelope of water, so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea.

Jeff and Jason there, are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.
We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas.
And I'm going to show you three clips, because I tagged 1,100 tunas.
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.
We bring the tuna out, we measure it.
A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes.
A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes.
We put water over its gills, give it oxygen.
And then with a lot of effort, after tagging, putting in the computer, making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment, we send this fish back into the sea.
With the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson, this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.
This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.
The warm is the Gulf Stream, the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.
Now in a second project called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics, we took on the planet as a team, those of us in the Census of Marine Life.
And, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others, we were able to actually go in, in our project -- we're one of 17 field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators, not just tunas.
So what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska, met salmon shark on their home territory, followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line, we can actually take up a salmon shark -- This is the cousin of the white shark -- and very carefully -- note, I say "very carefully," --
And then, as these animals swim and give us the information that's important to climate issues, we also think it's critical to get this information to the public, to engage the public with this kind of data.
We did this with the Great Turtle Race -- tagged turtles, brought in four million hits.
And now with Google's Oceans, we can actually put a white shark in that ocean.
But in June, I got a mail in my inbox from Demographic Health Surveys, and it showed good news from Kenya.
I was so happy.
This was the estimate of the new survey.
There is no such thing as a "Western world" and "developing world."
This is the report from [the] U.N., which came out on Friday.
It's very good -- "Levels and Trends in Child Mortality" -- except this page.

But before I show you what's inside, I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.
Is there a waiting list?
Not likely.
This gift came to me about five months ago.
This gift came to me about five months ago.
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty.
And this, and then this.
And this, and then this.
It was a rare gem -- a brain tumor, hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving.
And while I'm okay now, I wouldn't wish this gift for you.
And while I'm okay now, I wouldn't wish this gift for you.
I'm not sure you'd want it.

But I wouldn't change my experience.
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you.
That is a point that is not coming out from the Bible, but it's something that really accompanied humanity.
Let's have a look at this nice code that is coming from a Renaissance book.
Here we have the description of the order of nature.
So during the night, they curl the leaves and reduce the movement, and during the day, you have the opening of the leaves -- there is much more movement.
This is interesting because this sleeping machinery, it's perfectly conserved.
It's the same in plants, in insects and in animals.
So you can recognize this kind of movement, the same movement that worms, snakes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display.
And it's not an easy movement because, to have this kind of movement, you need to move different regions of the root and to synchronize these different regions without having a brain.
So we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here, depicted in blue -- that is called the "transition zone."
Because they evolved for the same reason: to survive predation.
They work in the same way.
So you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus and the plants [continue] to work.
So why does this matter?
Well, if we're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world, we need to learn from the innovators, and those innovators come from every single sector.
I feel that, if we can understand what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous, we can apply those lessons then for the public good.

They have this very continuous feedback loop.
They learn something, they put it back into the product, they put it back into the market.
They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."
Ultimately, Coke's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a Coca-Cola.
Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.
So, they rely on Coca-Cola in terms of its marketing, and what's the secret to their marketing?

Well, it's aspirational.
It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood, "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing," that also went number one on the pop charts.
Both songs have something in common: that same appeal of celebration and unity.
So how does health and development market?
One example is sanitation.
We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation.
But there's a solution: you build a toilet.

By August 30th, a genetic test was done, and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.
Now it could have come from one of two places.
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border, or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.
We have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in Haiti, but we haven't heard enough about why all those lives were lost.
We haven't heard about why the buildings failed.
After all, it was the buildings, not the earthquake, that killed 220,000 people, that injured 330,000, that displaced 1.3 million people, that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation.
Adjusted for population density, that is less than one percent of the impact of the Haitian quake.
What was the difference between Chile and Haiti?
Seismic standards and confined masonry, where the building acts as a whole -- walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other -- instead of breaking off into separate members and failing.
On his last job he was working with his boss, and they started pouring the columns wrong.
He took his boss aside, and he showed him the materials on confined masonry.
He showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong.
For the billions spent on reconstruction, you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime.
Ultimately, there are two ways that you can rebuild Haiti; the way at the top is the way that Haiti's been building for decades.
The way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail.
This is a tadpole walker to take your tadpole walking in the evening.
And the interesting thing that happens -- because we're using tadpoles, of course, because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have, several orders of magnitude more sensitive than some of our senses for sensing, responding in a biologically meaningful way, to that whole class of industrial contaminants we call endocrine disruptors or hormone emulators.
But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening -- there's a few action shots -- your neighbors are likely to say, "What are you doing?"
And I want to sort of point out the big advantage of framing health in this external way.
But we do have a few prescription products through this.
It's very different from the medical model.
That actually removes about 95 percent of the carbon black, that stuff that, with ozone, is responsible for about half of global warming's effects, because it changes, it settles on the snow, it changes the reflectors, it changes the transmission qualities of the atmosphere.
Carbon black is that grime that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs, and it's associated with.
It's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion, not from combustion itself.
And an early test which argument elicited cooperative behavior from the people below -- about a hundred to one decided that this was the argument that worked best on us.
Recorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick.
That's the sound of genetic mutations of the avian flu becoming a deadly human flu.
When the buoys get your text, they wink at you twice to say, we've got your message.
But perhaps the most popular has been that we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River, where the first beaver -- crazy as he is -- to have moved in and built a lodge in New York So updates from a beaver.
You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him.

And what I like to think of is this is an interface that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems, specifically by changing who has information, where they have it, who can make sense of that information, and what you can do about it.
And so every time that desire to interact with the animals, which is at least as ubiquitous as that sign: "Do not feed the animals."
And there's about three of them on every New York City park.
And Yellowstone National Park, there's more "do not feed the animals" signs than there are animals you might wish to feed.


Every presentation needs this slide in it.
I guess the shoes came off when he was hit.
He slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow.
It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it.
And he said, "I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity."
Just in case I thought the real Batman was coming after me; which actually made me feel a little better -- like, "Phew, it's not him."
So what I did -- unfortunately, I was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of me, and it started to eat away at my psyche.
A few months later, I went back to Uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built, and took pictures of seven of my new friends, posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website, spammed friends and family and said, "We think this is legal.
Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details, but do you say, do you want to help participate in this, provide the money that they need?"
The money came in basically overnight.


This technology made a very important impact on us.

This technology made a very important impact on us.
It changed the way our history developed.
We are the animals who eat cooked food.
No, no, no, no. Better -- to live of cooked food.
So cooking is a very important technology.
This technology affected two organs, the brain and the gut, which it actually affected.
The brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk.
Okay, it's not obvious to be honest.
You can continue to innovate and invent.
Now the big brain did this also with cooking.
But how did it actually run this show?
And within this structure, you see these two pinkish layers, which are actually the muscle.
And between this muscle, they found nervous tissues, a lot of nervous tissues, which penetrate actually the muscle -- penetrate the submucosa, where you have all the elements for the immune system.
The gut is actually the largest immune system, defending your body.
The gut is actually the largest immune system, defending your body.
It penetrates the mucosa.
This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest, which is actually the lumen.
It penetrates the mucosa.
This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest, which is actually the lumen.
Now if you think about the gut, the gut is -- if you could stretch it -- 40 meters long, the length of a tennis court.

Now if you think about the gut, the gut is -- if you could stretch it -- 40 meters long, the length of a tennis court.
If we could unroll it, get out all the folds and so on, it would have 400 sq. meters of surface.
And now this brain takes care over this, to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and, of course, digest our food we cook.
If we could unroll it, get out all the folds and so on, it would have 400 sq. meters of surface.
And now this brain takes care over this, to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and, of course, digest our food we cook.
So if we give you a specification, this brain, which is autonomous, have 500 million nerve cells, 100 million neurons -- so around the size of a cat brain, so there sleeps a little cat -- thinks for itself, optimizes whatever it digests.

It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain, where you have 100 billion neurons.

It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain, where you have 100 billion neurons.

It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain, where you have 100 billion neurons.
It has autonomous organized microcircuits, has these programs which run.
It senses the food; it knows exactly what to do.
This control of muscle is very, very important, because, you know, there can be reflexes.
If you don't like a food, especially if you're a child, you gag.
It's this brain which makes this reflex.
It's this brain which makes this reflex.
And then finally, it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery, which actually digests the food we cook.
Now how do the two brains work with each other?
The lower layer, our gut brain, has its own goals -- digestion defense -- and we have the higher brain with the goal of integration and generating behaviors.
Now both look -- and this is the blue arrows -- both look to the same food, which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine.
The big brain integrates signals, which come from the running programs of the lower brain, But subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower.
It can replace, or it can inhibit actually, signals.
So if we take two types of signals -- a hunger signal for example.
If you have an empty stomach, your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin.
At least in my case, they are not listened to.
So what happens if the big brain in the integration overrides the signal?
So if you override the hunger signal, you can have a disorder, which is called anorexia.
So if you override the hunger signal, you can have a disorder, which is called anorexia.
Despite generating a healthy hunger signal, the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut.
The more usual case is overeating.

And I hope you can see that there are some ring-like structures in the middle image, which is water.
This whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil.
And finally, on your right side, you see a bubbly, cell-like structure appearing, from which the body will absorb the fat.

I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations.
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years, some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic.
And I thought, "Great.
And I thought, "Great.
It's ephemeral just like us."
Upon educating myself a little further about plastics, I actually realized this was a bad thing.
And my initial reaction -- and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction to learning about it -- is, "Oh my God!
We've got to go out there and clean this thing up."
So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers, a crane, a chipping machine and a cold-molding machine.
But this is no news, right?
You've read about it already.
Ladies and gentlemen, the world has gotten smaller.
Well, you've got mail.
Yeah.
Well, the Internet has empowered us.
And on the third day, I finally understood, the guy was actually on duty.
So by now, there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files of the Vietnamese police.
No, but it's true: the Internet has changed the world.
No, but it's true: the Internet has changed the world.
It has rocked the music industry; it has changed the way we consume music.
For those of you old enough to remember, we used to have to go to the store to steal it.
So be careful with that Facebook account -- your momma told you, be careful.
And technology has set us free -- this is free WiFi.
But yeah, it has liberated us from the office desk.
Let me tell you a bit about it.
For example, how we started: Ratan just began with a five-engineer team, young people in their mid-twenties.
And he said, "Well, I won't define the vehicle for you, but I will define the cost for you.
These targets have been achieved in India.
And how they have been achieved ...
Sir Francis Bacon once said, "When you wish to achieve results that have not been achieved before, it is an unwise fancy to think that they can be achieved by using methods that have been used before."
But it was a poor school with rich teachers, honestly.
And one of them was [unclear] who taught us physics.
One day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of a convex lens.
The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down.
And there was a bright spot up there.
And then he said, "This is the focal length."
But more importantly, focus and you can achieve.
And that message, very frankly, is valuable for society today.
What does that focal length do?
It has parallel lines, which are sun rays.
And the property of parallel lines is that they never meet.
What does that convex lens do?
But let me tell you a little bit about the other shift that I'm talking about, which is power diffusion.
To understand power diffusion put this in your mind: computing and communications costs have fallen a thousandfold between 1970 and the beginning of this century.
Now that's a big abstract number.
Power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want, and you can do it in three ways.
You can do it with threats of coercion, "sticks," you can do it with payments, "carrots," or you can do it by getting others to want what you want.
And that ability to get others to want what you want, to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment, is what I call soft power.
We don't have to fear the rise of China or the return of Asia.
And if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective, we're going to be able to manage this process.
Let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion and then pull these two types together.
There's no escaping the fact that everything we eat has a global impact.
So try and learn as best you can what that impact is and then take the first step to minimize it.
We've seen an image of our blue planet, our world bank.
So it's everywhere, and we need to know how to exploit it.
Well let us go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples.
What is a pest?
And here comes the natural enemy, minute pirate bug, "minute" because it is rather small.
Here you can see the adult, black, and two young ones.
And again, in action.
It's a very great pleasure to fly around.
And so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement.
But this isn't the really interesting stuff.
We notice, looking at all these people opening boxes, that when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies, their perception shifts, they start to get a bit bored, a bit testy.
They're not rational about probability.
They think this game is unfair.
So I began to work with National Geographic Society and others and led expeditions to Antarctica.
I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica.
Ten years ago was a seminal trip, where we explored that big iceberg, B-15, the largest iceberg in history, that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.
There's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land.
It's an interesting fact.
And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts.
And that's the area again.
You can see the Islands -- there are eight islands -- that pop out of the water.
The peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts.
They realized that this was a common cause that they had found with the conservation community.
Then in 2002, when this was all going full-swing, a coral-bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands.
Here's this resource that we're looking to save, and it turns out it's the hottest heating event that we can find on record.
If you look very carefully, you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent Plexiglas dome so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light.
That's exactly what I do -- optical mind control.
But in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination, my motives are not sinister.

But in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination, my motives are not sinister.
I control the brain in order to understand how it works.
An experienced code-breaker will tell you that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean, it's essential to be able to play with them, to rearrange them at will.
So in this situation too, to decode the information contained in patterns like this, watching alone won't do.
We need to rearrange the pattern.
Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA, we can achieve incredible precision.
This is because, although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes, different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells.
You can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light-activated pore and others don't.
You're familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you when you try to swat the fly.
They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air and fly away whenever you move your hand in position.
And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.
They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air and fly away whenever you move your hand in position.
And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.
The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them, but it can't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates.
Each chamber in these two vertical stacks contains one fly.
The left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors, and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them.
Here's some such CCTV footage.
The left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors, and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them.
Here's some such CCTV footage.
Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet, it has to make a decision.
So we set out to identify the cells in the fly's brain that played the role of the Critic.
And the logic of our experiment was simple.
We thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the Critic, we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor into changing its policy.
We have created such a situation, artificially, by turning on the critic with a flash of light.
That caused a strengthening of the connections between the currently active odor detector and the motors.
So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again, the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver.

So, I wanted to do something special today.
I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months.
Because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms.
And so this is basically a song about loops, but not the kind of loops that I make up here.
They're feedback loops.
So, I've been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves, if that's possible.
And that's what the song is asking.
All right.
And that's what the song is asking.

And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County, but I feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the U.S. and maybe even beyond.
So the first of the three is design for education.
This is the most kind of direct, obvious intersection of the two things.
And this also meant the co-creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape.
It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid.
So this game that the kids are playing here -- in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called Match Me.
So "design as education" means that we could actually teach design within public schools, and not design-based learning -- not like "let's learn physics by building a rocket," but actually learning design-thinking coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose.
It also means that designers are no longer consultants, but we're teachers, and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation.
And what design offers as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by.
What design and building really offers to public education is a different kind of classroom.
So this building downtown, which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market, is now the classroom.
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that's a homework assignment.
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that's a homework assignment.
And the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public -- that's the final exam.
And for the community, what design and building offers is real, visible, built progress.
These are not normally the most cheerful of topics, nor do they generally generate the kind of good news that this conference is about.
Yet, not only is there at least some good news to be told about fewer such conflicts now than two decades ago, but what is perhaps more important is that we also have come to a much better understanding of what can be done to further reduce the number of ethnic conflicts and civil wars and the suffering that they inflict.
Three things stand out: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design.
Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures from the Middle East, Darfur, Iraq, elsewhere, there is a longer-term trend that does represent some good news.
Over the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War, there has been an overall decline in the number of civil wars.
Since the high in the early 1990s, with about 50 such civil wars ongoing, we now have 30 percent fewer such conflicts today.
Leaders need to connect to each other and to their followers, and they need to bring them along on what is an often arduous journey into a peaceful future.
Second, diplomacy.
Diplomacy needs to be well resourced, sustained, and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers.
We are at a private school in the American West, sitting in red velvet chairs with money in our pockets.
And if we look at our lives, we have indeed taken the best part of the meat.
So let's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain, and know that when you see these people's faces that these are not just images of the Lakota; they stand for all indigenous people.
The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux.
In fact, this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy.
1869: The transcontinental railroad was completed.
To this day, this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle.
More Medals of Honor were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children than for any battle in World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan.
The Wounded Knee massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars.
That factory -- over a dozen people have committed suicide already this year.
One man died after working a 36-hour shift.
We all love chocolate.
We don't have a regulatory system able to ensure that that production is safe.
We don't have a system to ensure that human rights, basic dignity, are ensured.
So at a national level -- and we work in about 60 different countries -- at a national level we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate production on their own soil.
They don't employ those workers.
They're not legally liable.
Everybody else at the table said, "Folks, that doesn't cut it.
I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity.
And I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species.
So here's a food web, or a map of feeding links between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California.
So what's the problem, why has this chasm opened up, and what can we do to fix it?
Well actually, I think the answer is staring us right in the face: Use computers.
I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work.
I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work.
So to explain that, let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education.
See, in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.
So to explain that, let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education.
See, in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.
It's done by geologists, engineers, biologists, all sorts of different people -- modeling and simulation.
It's actually very popular.
But in education it looks very different -- dumbed-down problems, lots of calculating, mostly by hand.
Lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world, except if you're learning it.
So let's zoom out a bit and ask, why are we teaching people math?
What's the point of teaching people math?
And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?
Once you've done that, then there's the computation step.
Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form.
And of course, math is very powerful at doing that.
So I think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating.
But that math liberation didn't get into education yet.
See, I think of calculating, in a sense, as the machinery of math.
But that math liberation didn't get into education yet.
See, I think of calculating, in a sense, as the machinery of math.
It's the chore.
See, I think of calculating, in a sense, as the machinery of math.
It's the chore.
It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.
You shouldn't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject.
So my usual question is, what do you mean by "basics?"
Basics of what?
And what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore.
Might have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore.
When they're out of education, they do it on a computer.
Might have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore.
When they're out of education, they do it on a computer.
Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem, actually make it more conceptual.
I think there is one thing that I think very valid here, which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important.
But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world.
It's called programming.
And we open up so many more possibilities.
You can do so many more problems.
What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they've ever got before.

We want people who can feel the math instinctively.
That's what computers allow us to do.
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum.
No, what I'm suggesting is that we should leap off, we should increase our velocity so it's high, and we should leap off one side and go the other -- of course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully.
So I want to see a completely renewed, changed math curriculum built from the ground up, based on computers being there, computers that are now ubiquitous almost.
Calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years.
This brief list includes human beings, natural landforms, works of art and skilled human actions.
An account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy.
I can, however, give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have.
And we get it not from a philosopher of art, not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic.
No, this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding, and you know who I mean: Charles Darwin.
Of course, a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question, "What is beauty?"

It's in the eye of the beholder.
Natural selection also explains pleasures -- sexual pleasure, our liking for sweet, fat and proteins, which in turn explains a lot of popular foods, from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs.
The other great principle of evolution is sexual selection, and it operates very differently.
The peacock's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this.
So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop-shaped stone, don't be so sure it's just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful.
Your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it, even before they could put their love into words.
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?

Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?
No, it's deep in our minds.
Now, I come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology.
I used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen.
And before I worked with the kids, anything that I did with them, or anything that I did with myself, was supposed to be perfect, ideal, optimal, but after working with them for some time, I discovered the great virtues of empathy and flexibility and being able to start with some vision, and if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened.
In fact, my mother told me eventually that I was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school.
I ran away.
I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali, and there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia, and together, over 20 years, we built an amazing jewelry business.
We're on the grid. We're not proud of it.
But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris is taking us off the grid with solar.
And this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world, in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river.
When the turbine drops in, it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity, day and night.
And you know what these are.
There's nowhere to flush.
We made space for these guys who are Bali's last black pigs.
And the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field.
These young ladies are living in a rice culture, but they know something that few people know in a rice culture.
A man came from Java with a new kind of organic agriculture.
A woman came from Africa with music.
And together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global, green leaders.
And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do, so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building and when the scaffolding came down, we realized that we had a cathedral, a cathedral to green, and a cathedral to green education.
The heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it.
From the time the foundations were finished, in three months it had roofs and floors.
Is this doable in your community?
We believe it is.
Green School is a model we built for the world.
We are talking about the high seas.
The "high seas" is a legal term, but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.
With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth.

With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth.
It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all.

It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all.
So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas.
It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones of these five Central American countries, but it moves with the season.
As such, it does create a challenge to protect, but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.
And in order to do that, you also need ocean-basin management regimes.
That is, we have regional management regimes within the exclusive economic zone, but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity, so they're like the Southern Ocean, where they do have the two-pronged fisheries and conservation organization.
So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish, for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.

It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote.
How do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion?
How do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play, cleared for return to play, applies to them?
The definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness.
You have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today.
There are some great resources out there.
The CDC has a program, Heads Up.
The second is a resource I'm personally really proud of.
We've just rolled this out in the last couple months -- CO Kids With Brain Injury.
This is a great resource for student athletes, teachers, parents, professionals, athletic and coaching staff.
Everything in my room was shaking -- my heart, my windows, my bed, everything.
I looked out the windows and I saw a full half-circle of explosion.
I thought it was just like the movies, but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray, and a full circle of explosion.

And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared.
You see, I grew up in war-torn Iraq, and I believe that there are two sides of wars and we've only seen one side of it.
We only talk about one side of it.
But there's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it.
And those are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops.
So I had one of those, so I made some low-tech gadgetry, there, where you just stomp on the shoe last and then the door flies open, you throw your laundry down.
And then if you're smart enough, it goes on a basket on top of the washer.
It doesn't look like a can of beer, but the design take-offs are absolutely unmistakable.
The barley hops design worked up into the eaves, then the dentil work comes directly off the can's red, white, blue and silver.
Then, these corbeles going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can.
But I get a lot of toilets, and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer, and then you have lumpy tiles.
And then the faucet, there, is a beer tap.
Then, this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle-class front door in America.

But then if you put it in the front door, people say, "Oh, you're trying to be like those guys, and you didn't make it."
And you'd have to start a new category, right between cell phones and chocolate.
That's how we process information.
So you translate that to the building industry, if we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked, we go, "Oh, dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it.
Let's take it out. Throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in."
Because that's what you do with a cracked pane.
Never mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all.
How disgusting.
But you know what they did? They hooked a metaphor into it and said, "I drink Dr. Pepper ..."
And pretty soon, we're swilling that stuff by the lake-ful, by the billions of gallons.
My oh my, that makes it worse.
And we get sucked into that faster than anything.
Then a man named Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book titled "Being and Nothingness."

It's a pretty quick read.
The youngest son took his ninth -- a ninth of 18 is two.
You get 17.
They had one camel left over.
You get 17.
They had one camel left over.
They gave it back to the wise old woman.
That's the question.
As I've spent the last better part of three decades, almost four, traveling the world, trying to work, getting involved in conflicts ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East to Chechnya to Venezuela -- some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet -- I've been asking myself that question.
And I think I've found, in some ways, what is the secret to peace.

And if tempers are still too high, then they send someone off to visit some relatives, as a cooling-off period.
Well, that system is, I think, probably the system that kept us alive to this point, given our human tendencies.
That system, I call "the third side."
Let me just show you one thing.
I have a little acorn here that I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year.
Now, the acorn is associated with the oak tree, of course -- grows into an oak tree, which is associated with Abraham.
There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this.
How are we going to feed this world?
And if you look at the figures up there, it says that we have a third more mouths to feed, but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent.
And if you look at the figures up there, it says that we have a third more mouths to feed, but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent.
And that's especially because this world population is increasing, and it's increasing, not only in numbers, but we're also getting wealthier, and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat.
And meat, in fact, is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production.
And meat, in fact, is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production.
Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins, and at the moment, most of us here get it from livestock, from fish, from game.

In the developed world it's on average 80 kilograms per person per year, which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries, but on average 80 kilograms per person per year.
In the developed world it's on average 80 kilograms per person per year, which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries, but on average 80 kilograms per person per year.
In the developing world it's much lower.
It's 25 kilograms per person per year.
In the developing world it's much lower.
It's 25 kilograms per person per year.
But it's increasing enormously.
But it's increasing enormously.
In China in the last 20 years, it increased from 20 to 50, and it's still increasing.
So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average, and a third of the world population is living in China and in India, we're having an enormous demand on meat.
And then 80 percent of the world already eats insects, so we are just a minority -- in a country like the U.K., the USA, the Netherlands, anywhere.
On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.
Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp?
There are a few people who don't like shrimp, but shrimp, or crabs, or crayfish, are very closely related.
They are delicacies.
There's a target somewhere here.
You see an operator, a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right.
There, the animal finds a mine.
Well don't talk rat, but we have a clicker, a standard method for animal training, which you see there.
A clicker, which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors.
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.
Once the animal knows click, food, click, food, click, food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole, and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed, and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds, which is long for a rat.
Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.
They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards, just like dogs have to pass a test.
This consists of 400 square meters.
There's a number of mines placed blindly, and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets.


Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world.
I want to take something rather humble to discuss.
I found this in the farmers' market today, and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to.
The humble potato -- and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these.
I found this in the farmers' market today, and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to.

And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime.

And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime.
First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy.
It grows and is nurtured.
It's then harvested.
It's then distributed, and distribution is a massive issue.

It's then sold and bought, and it's then delivered to me.
Chairs: recycled and recyclable.
Tables: Forestry Commission.
This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood.
But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins, experiment with polymers.
Will they outlive me? They probably might.
Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.
This is the kitchen, which is in the same room.
I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume.
Rather than me putting a dish down, they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.
I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume.
Rather than me putting a dish down, they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.
Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.
We generate quite a lot of waste.
This is the waste room.
You can't get rid of waste.
In here, I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable.
I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator -- turns food into an inner material, which I can store and then compost later.
I compost it in this garden.
Three compost bins -- go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week -- really good, makes fantastic compost.
A couple of wormeries in there too.
And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.
I don't know how many worms [were] in there, but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.
What you're seeing here is a water filtration system.
This takes the water out of the restaurant, runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there -- and I sort of water the garden with it.
They're all English and a little bit more sustainable.
But this is an electrical restaurant.
The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.
But this is an electrical restaurant.
The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.
And it's run on hydroelectricity, so I've gone from air to water.
The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.
And it's run on hydroelectricity, so I've gone from air to water.
Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water, heated by water, filters its own water, and it's powered by water.
It literally is Waterhouse.
The air handling system inside it -- I got rid of air-conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there.
This is basically air-handling.
And this is an English willow air diffuser, and that's softly moving that air current through the room.
Very advanced, no air-conditioning -- I love it.
In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant, there is hundreds of meters of coil piping.
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do; I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.
So in my 12 years of wisdom, I zip my pants down, I walk out into the room, and lo and behold to me, while I was in the room with Sheila, Johnny was back at the window calling guys up.
So now there's a living room full of guys.
So in my 12 years of wisdom, I zip my pants down, I walk out into the room, and lo and behold to me, while I was in the room with Sheila, Johnny was back at the window calling guys up.

It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.
The 200,000-year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end, believe it or not, and that's why I talk about the "end of men."
Now all you men out there, this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes, because the point is that this is happening to all of us.
I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love.
Now what does that mean?
It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs and low-skill, low-wage jobs -- and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs, and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.
This has been going on for 40 years now.
And this was kind of a shocker to me.
And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls: "Men are the new ball and chain."
Now you laugh, but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?
And so it feels like we have to move from this place where we've got these uber-exaggerated images into something that feels a little more normal.
So for a long time in the economic sphere, we've lived with the term "glass ceiling."
Now I've never really liked this term.
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"
And they immediately went, "There it is."
Didn't read anything. "There it is."
RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love.
AV: We did.
RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website.
And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this.
The sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying.
I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested, and in fact, it was not like that at all.
You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be.
I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it.
I felt incredibly connected to the community around me.
It can't possibly be that bad.
So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece, and she interviewed four scientists, and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert, and we did indeed find a silver lining.
So this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life.
On our shelves at home, we have a box set of the DVD series "24," season six to be precise.
I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present.
Now my husband, Chris, and I love this show.
We now live in a connected age where we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time, from a small device in our hands.
All of this was going through my head towards the end of 2008, when, of course, the great financial crash happened.
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists, that 2008 is when we hit a wall, when Mother Nature and the market both said, "No more."
So my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I have actually gathered thousands of examples from all around the world of collaborative consumption.
And although they vary enormously in scale, maturity and purpose, when we dived into them, we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.
The first is redistribution markets.

Together they grow their own food.
It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant, you wonder why it's never been done before.
Now, the third system is product-service systems.
I believe also, our generation, our relationship to satisfying what we want is far less tangible than any other previous generation.
I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.
I don't want a clunky answering machine; I want the message it saves.
In other words, I can trust him or her.
Now mark my words, it's only a matter of time before we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search and see a cumulative picture of our reputation capital.
And this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption.
And surprisingly, it became a cult film.
And we can only work that out as people were seeing parallels between the thuggish side of nature and gang warfare.
DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name, Eetwidomayloh, represents.
There's an immense amount of poaching as well, and so possibly the same amount.
It's simply not sustainable.
We admire them, and we fear them, and yet, as man, we want to steal their power.
It's simply not sustainable.
We admire them, and we fear them, and yet, as man, we want to steal their power.
It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin, but now throughout rituals and ceremonies, traditional healers and ministers.
That is, if we don't take action and do something, these plains will be completely devoid of big cats, and then, in turn, everything else will disappear.
And simply, if we can't protect them, we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.
DJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by -- that conservation was all about respect and celebration -- is probably true. That's really what it needs.
What are the messages we tell our daughters?
Now, at the outset, I want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments.
I don't have the right answer.
But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back?
Everyone who's been through this -- and I'm here to tell you, once you have a child at home, your job better be really good to go back, because it's hard to leave that kid at home.
Your job needs to be challenging.
They've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.
Another problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.
Working-class and poor urban Americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system.
And imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability.
So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.
These examples indicate a trend.
And I thought he was just sweet-talking me.
I was like, "Really?" and he was like, "Absolutely."
And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the "life's messy, love it."
And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the "life's messy, love it."
And I'm more of the, "life's messy, clean it up, organize it and put it into a bento box."
And so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me -- really, one of the big sayings in social work is, "Lean into the discomfort of the work."
And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection: Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it, that I won't be worthy of connection?
The things I can tell you about it: It's universal; we all have it.
The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection.
This idea of, in order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.
And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.
And so I thought, this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick.
My one year turned into six years: Thousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups.
At one point, people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories -- thousands of pieces of data in six years.
And I kind of got a handle on it.
And so here's what I found.
What they had in common was a sense of courage.
And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute.
A way to discharge pain and discomfort.
We perfect.
If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me, but it doesn't work.
They made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments.
Banking hasn't always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers.
Even Goldman Sachs once used to serve clients, before it turned into an institution that serves only itself.
So I read slowly.
I'd set aside three weeks for this project, and that, I think, is what is meant by "hubris" --  -- because it turned out to be three months.
I did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are.
Because the Koran is quite clear when it says that you'll be "a new creation in paradise" and that you will be "recreated in a form unknown to you," which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin.
And that number 72 never appears.
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran.
How can the brain generate that much information, that much music, spontaneously?
And so I set out with this concept, scientifically, that artistic creativity, it's magical, but it's not magic, meaning that it's a product of the brain.
There's not too many brain-dead people creating art.
And so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the NIH, and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left, the lower-left -- which is what you heard me playing -- and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes.
And if you can hit that lower-right sound icon, that's an example of what was recorded in the scanner.
So in the end, it's not the most natural environment, but they're able to play real music.
Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast, but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally, just like we can with a digital camera.
The U.S. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment, and what have we gained from that investment?
In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars, digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography, and in fact, it was worse in older women.
So digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment, but it's been a very small step forward for womankind.
What about ultrasound?
Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies, so it's not widely used.
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge, bulky tubes, and they were filled with these scintillating crystals, and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors.
But the potential advantage was that gamma rays, unlike X-rays, are not influenced by breast density.
But this technology could not find tumors when they're small, and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.
So here we were, a nuclear physicist, an internist, soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer, and two radiologists, and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape.
To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement, but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system.
This is our current detector.
But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive -- it's as accurate as MRI, it's far less complex to interpret, and it's a fraction of the cost.
But you can understand why there may be forces in the breast-imaging world who prefer the status quo.
After achieving what we felt were remarkable results, our manuscript was rejected by four journals.
Second, if you're pre-menopausal, try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle, when breast density is relatively lower.
Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast, insist on additional imaging.
And fourth and most important, the mammography debate will rage on, but I do believe that all women 40 and older should have an annual mammogram.
and you get to be first in line -- even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.
And slowly over time, I started putting myself in a better mood.
I mean, 50,000 blogs are started a day, and so my blog was just one of those 50,000.
And slowly over time, I started putting myself in a better mood.
I mean, 50,000 blogs are started a day, and so my blog was just one of those 50,000.
And nobody read it except for my mom.

Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by 100 percent when she forwarded it to my dad.
And nobody read it except for my mom.
Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by 100 percent when she forwarded it to my dad.
And then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits, and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions.
And he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out."
And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.
And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf, and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.
And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.
And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf, and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.
And when we did, my dad would say, "Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there, picked this thing off it, put it in a truck, drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,
We've got all that, but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.
And that's the sad part.
The cashiers at your grocery store, the foreman at your plant, the guy tailgating you home on the highway, the telemarketer calling you during dinner, every teacher you've ever had, everyone that's ever woken up beside you, every politician in every country, every actor in every movie, every single person in your family, everyone you love, everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years.
And the other thing that happens is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology.
We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier, and then we can take anything out.
What does the inside of your computer actually look like?
And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years, I was thinking at night, "I want to be the first person to create a wormhole, to make things accelerate faster.
And I want to make a time machine."
I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders.
And I want to make a time machine."
I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders.
But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works.

I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders.
But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works.
And so this is very important.
I'm really worried that, especially kids today, they're not going to be dealing with this down-time, that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture, and that everything comes to them, and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.
So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.
Ray: It was Crease Limestone, and that was produced by sea creatures 350 million years ago in a nice, warm, sunny atmosphere.
When you study geology, you can see what's happened in the past, and there were terrific changes in the earth.
Thomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up.
When you study geology, you can see what's happened in the past, and there were terrific changes in the earth.
Thomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up.
And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore, because, though Ray was a miner there, the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction, because, of course, it can't compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America, Australia, wherever.
But instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower.
And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project, was, the smaller the scale you want to work on, the further back in time you have to go.
And so this is after a day and about half a night smelting this iron.
But luckily, I found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves, and at 30 minutes at full power, and I was able to finish off the process.
So, my next --  The next thing I was trying to get was copper.
Again, this mine was once the largest copper mine in the world.
I poured it into the mold, which you can see there, which I've made from a tree trunk.
And it was looking good for a while, but I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry, and unfortunately I came back and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato.
So kind of out of desperation, I decided that I could think laterally.
But this is it.
So there's a picture of my toaster.
That's it without the case on.
That's it without the case on.
And there it is on the shelves.
Thanks.
We want our babies to read when they are six months old.
Have you seen the ads?
We want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average, but what this does to our children is really not healthy.
They're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.
And what they're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton, which is very bad news, because so much life depends on it.
So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it, this disaster is still unfolding.
Can we put this off till 2020, 2030, 2050?"
Or we ask, "How much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive?
Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or -- where we're currently going -- four degrees Celsius?"
It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal, the likes of which we haven't yet seen.
And most controversially, it means the tar sands.
I'm always surprised by how little people outside of Canada know about the Alberta Tar Sands, which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the United States.
It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice, because I believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we're on like little else.
So this is where the tar sands live, under one of the last magnificent Boreal forests.
The oil is not liquid.
Every day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side, administering medicine directly to your heart, and it's not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses.
This is a list of the side effects: if you eat too much salt, like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you'll probably end up in the ICU.
If you go through a metal detector, you'll probably die.
But when I needed it, it was a godsend.
Within a few days, I could walk again.
Within a few weeks, I was performing, and in a few months, I debuted at the Kennedy Center.
You could see my over-sized heart beating inside of it.
I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive.
An infection ravaged my skin.
I couldn't walk, I couldn't talk, I couldn't eat, I couldn't move, I certainly couldn't sing, I couldn't even breathe, but when I looked up and I saw my mother, I couldn't help but smile.
Whether by a Mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs, death happens.
But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it?
People got very upset when the BP oil spill happened for very good reason.
People thought about, "Oh, my God.
This is terrible, this oil -- it's in the water.
There's no poison. There's no pollution.
It turns out that our other species has figured out a long time ago how to create many of the things that we need using biological processes that nature knows how to use well.
Well that insight of biomimicry, of our scientists finally realizing that we have as much to learn from other species.
So what we do is that we put all these slices together.
Imagine that you slice your body in all these directions, and then you try to put the slices back together again into a pile of data, into a block of data.
So this is really what we're doing.
It's very easy to look at metal artifacts that we can show inside of the body.
You can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth -- that's actually the filling of the teeth -- but because I've set the functions to show me metal and make everything else transparent.
Here's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person.
So just looking at this heart, I can play back a video here.
And this is Karljohan, one of my graduate students who's been working on this project.
And he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device, the force feedback system, and he's moving his pen towards the heart, and the heart is now beating in front of him, so he can see how the heart is beating.
We can investigate things. We can tell him to do things.
You can also see that his visual cortex is activated in the back of the head, because that's where he's seeing, he's seeing his own brain.
And he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things.
We can scan all sorts of things, all sorts of animals.
The only problem is to fit it into the machine.
So here's a bear.
I think he's going to be super popular.
We've got the robot -- in his head is a database of a lot of jokes.
Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.
We've got the robot -- in his head is a database of a lot of jokes.
Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.
So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length.
Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.
So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length.
It knows how much it's moving.
It knows how much it's moving.
And so it's going to try to watch your response.
I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.
If you like what's going on, show the green.
If you don't like the subject or the performance, you can hold the red.
Now don't be shy.
If you don't like the subject or the performance, you can hold the red.
Now don't be shy.
It's just a robot.
The guy's voice comes back on the line, "Okay, now what?"
Question: Why is television called a medium?
Anyone?
Because it's neither rare nor well done.
But to be completely honest with you, I kind of love television.
Any of you like television? Audience: Yes.
But to be completely honest with you, I kind of love television.
Any of you like television? Audience: Yes.
Data: I find it incredibly educational.
Now, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize, they also westernize.
This is an illusion.
It's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition, markets and technology.
And I'll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them.
"Window dressing.
When China gets its hands on Hong Kong, that won't be the case."
That is the nation-state mentality.
But you can't run a country like China, a civilization-state, on the basis of one civilization, one system.
It doesn't work.
And the reason for this is, firstly, because the state in China is given a very special -- it enjoys a very special significance as the representative, the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization, of the civilization-state.
This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role.
And the second reason is because, whereas in Europe and North America, the state's power is continuously challenged -- I mean in the European tradition, historically against the church, against other sectors of the aristocracy, against merchants and so on -- for 1,000 years, the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged.
It's had no serious rivals.
So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history.
The result, by the way, is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state.
And, apart from the Mao period, that has remained more or less the case ever since.
But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state.
The state is everywhere in China.
And yet we still insist, by and large, in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience, looking at it through Western eyes, using Western concepts.
If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong -- our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect -- this is the reason.
Unfortunately, I think, I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.
If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong -- our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect -- this is the reason.
Unfortunately, I think, I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.
It's kind of arrogant.
Unfortunately, I think, I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.
It's kind of arrogant.
It's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best, and therefore we have the universal measure.
When did that last happen?
I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago.
And that is what is going to happen in the future.
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together.
Or take this: now this is an idea, but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing.
Here you have a megabus, on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people.
Or take this: now this is an idea, but it's an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing.
Here you have a megabus, on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people.
It travels on rails down a suburban road, and the cars travel underneath it.
Actually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad.
Nobody's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug Havidol quite yet.
But it looks completely right.
They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal, works for our food, actually helps people understand what's in their food.
God forbid we should use that same standard that we make Cap'n Crunch live by and bring it to drug companies.
So let me just walk through this quickly.
So let me just walk through this quickly.
It says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for, so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you.
You can understand exactly what the benefits are.
The last one I'll show you is a PSA test.
Here's the before, and here's the after.
Now a lot of our effort on this one -- as many of you probably know, a PSA test is a very controversial test.
And so we spent a good deal of our time indicating that.
We again personalized the risks.
So this patient is in their 50s, so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is.
We're told what to wear --  -- and how to do our hair --  -- and how to behave.
Now the rules that I'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture.
We're being corrected, and the primary policemen are women, because we are the carriers of the tradition.
We don't know what's going on half the time, so it puts us in a very tenuous position.
Now if you don't like these rules, and many of us don't -- I know I didn't, and I still don't, even though I follow them half the time, not quite aware that I'm following them -- what better way than to change them [than] with humor?
Humor relies on the traditions of a society.
Now if you don't like these rules, and many of us don't -- I know I didn't, and I still don't, even though I follow them half the time, not quite aware that I'm following them -- what better way than to change them [than] with humor?
Humor relies on the traditions of a society.
It takes what we know, and it twists it.
Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition.
We have amazing antennae.
Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists, which I so enjoy, and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth, to get at the issues quickly and succinctly.
And then third, sort of a dad for every side.
We kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing.
So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men.
Actually I had Cisplatin, Doxorubicin and very high-dose Methotrexate.
And then I had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium.
And if you did see the Sanjay special, you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis.

And if you did see the Sanjay special, you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis.
Then he took my fibula from my calf, cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh, where it now lives.
You may encounter one from time to time, but you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it.
But whatever you do, don't succumb to it.
Don't give in to the wall.
He was called a "flaneur," one who wanders the arcades.
And it was the custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace.
And I just love this ode to slow moving.
And also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges.
And finally, how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef.
I get asked two questions about this project.
Narrator: Of all things Americans are, we are makers.
With our strengths and our minds and spirit, we gather, we form, and we fashion.
Makers and shapers and put-it-togetherers.
Fascinating work they're doing.
We just had an issue on space exploration, DIY space exploration.
This is probably the best time in the history of mankind to love space.
That's easier for them to find out than who you are.
And even though that's still sort of creepy, there is an upside to having your taste monitored.
Suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn't been before.
Better than any other mammal on Earth, we can sweat really well.
But the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that, when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances, we're superb, we're the best on the planet.
You take a horse on a hot day, and after about five or six miles, that horse has a choice.
I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum.
I will not dance to that beating.
I know that beat.
I know that beat.
It is lifeless.
I know intimately that skin you are hitting.
I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping.
What that means is prepping my outfit,  prepping options, trying to figure out what I'm coming behind and going in front of.
Poetry does that.
Profits made, prophets ignored.
War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods.
All colors run, none of us solid.
The second observation I'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us.
We should stop looking outside.
It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead.
A fourth observation: We need to approach balance in a balanced way.
A friend came to see me last year -- and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year and said, "Nigel, I've read your book.
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance.
We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio.
And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo.
This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo, introducing Leo to a new object.
So we actually explored this idea in our lab.
This is a robot, Autom.
Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work.
This is a robot, Autom.
Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work.
And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach.

You'd use a screen interface to enter information, like how many calories you ate that day, how much exercise you got.
You'd use a screen interface to enter information, like how many calories you ate that day, how much exercise you got.
And then it could help track that for you.
And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and patients and so forth.

And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue.
What if --  Nathan: Here it comes. Yay!
CB: -- the character itself could come into your world?
It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world.
What if --  Nathan: Here it comes. Yay!
CB: -- the character itself could come into your world?
It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world.
So here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2.
You can imagine maybe these symbols give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world.
So they are now sending the character back into that world.
And thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy.
And for all three of these, I believe, biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need.
You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products, and all of those have benefited from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period.
And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it.
So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas.
And let's start with radical increases in resource efficiency.
And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass, which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes.
And in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes.
So we started exploring this material called ETFE.
So we started exploring this material called ETFE.
It's a high-strength polymer.
And what you do is you put it together in three layers, you weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it.
Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste.
And I'm just going to talk through this animation.
So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.
And I'm just going to talk through this animation.
So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.
They then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding.
So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.
They then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding.
When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it.
So it transformed a linear process into a closed-loop model, and it created more value in the process.
Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this, turning waste streams into schemes that create value.
And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time, there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing.
The more vegetation we lose, the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification.
And this animation, this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years, and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts shift quite a lot, and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions to halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification.
And if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts, there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity.

This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle, and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert.

And those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water.
Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water.
And the effect of this is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps, they stay in tight, spherical beads, which means they're much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell.

This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions, and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills, and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process.
So inside it's cool and humid, which means the plants need less water to grow.
And then at the back of the greenhouse, it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle.
And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages.
When you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out is calcium carbonate.
And that builds up on the evaporators -- and that's what that image on the left is -- gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate.
And in parts of the Arabian Gulf, the seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants.
And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse.
Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine.
No, you can't.
Actually it's very simple.
The track that I will whistle is called "Fête de la Belle."

We're here to celebrate compassion.
But compassion, from my vantage point, has a problem.

But compassion, from my vantage point, has a problem.
As essential as it is across our traditions, as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives, the word "compassion" is hollowed out in our culture, and it is suspect in my field of journalism.

It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing, or it's seen as potentially depressing.
Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story of giving a speech in Holland and, after the fact, the word "compassion" was translated as "pity."
And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter, that they shape the way we understand ourselves, the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others.
When this country first encountered genuine diversity in the 1960s, we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that.
Now the word "tolerance," if you look at it in the dictionary, connotes "allowing," "indulging" and "enduring."
And the going is pretty rough right now.
I think that without perhaps being able to name it, we are collectively experiencing that we've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue.
Compassion is a worthy successor.

Compassion is a worthy successor.
It is organic, across our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions, and yet it transcends them.

Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others, both in our private and in our civic spaces.
They are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young Jews and Muslims, and as they do that, they cultivate what they call "curiosity without assumptions."
Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion.
Compassion can be synonymous with empathy.
Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion.
Compassion can be synonymous with empathy.
It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation, but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence.
I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty -- and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other, not just what it is about them that might need helping.
I love it that my Muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value.
And in that light, for the religious, compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty, but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering, in the face of a stranger, in the face of the vibrant religious other.

He says that he's just at an extreme end of the spectrum we're all on.
He's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.
And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit.
But again and again, lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness.
Jean Vanier says that his work, like the work of other people -- his great, beloved, late friend Mother Teresa -- is never in the first instance about changing the world; it's in the first instance about changing ourselves.
He's says that what they do with L'Arche is not a solution, but a sign.
And at the same time that we are doing that, I think we are rediscovering the power of story -- that as human beings, we need stories to survive, to flourish, to change.
Our traditions have always known this, and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us.
There is, of course, a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of Judaism to repair the world -- tikkun olam.

And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen, who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her, that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces.
It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation.
It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation.
And that the highest human calling is to look for this light, to point at it when we see it, to gather it up, and in so doing, to repair the world.
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale.
He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages.
Some of his favorites were Moses, Jesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi, Gandhi -- he adored his contemporary, Gandhi.
And Einstein said -- and I think this is a quote, again, that has not been passed down in his legacy -- that "these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living, more necessary to the dignity, security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge."
Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor because of her life-long struggle with Crohn's disease.
Einstein became a humanitarian, not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter, but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist.
And Karen Armstrong, I think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that, with a zigzag, have led to the Charter for Compassion.
So I want to propose a final definition of compassion -- this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way -- and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology.
Now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this, and we need them to mine it for us now.
But compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious.
And you'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language.
Babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven, and then there's a systematic decline.
After puberty, we fall off the map.
And my hat's off to you in Kibera.
My own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive.
At Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital -- money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity, but as full-bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions.
And he said to me at the end of his year, "Jacqueline, it was so humbling, because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture.
But especially when I was talking to the African women, I sometimes made these mistakes -- it was so hard for me to learn how to listen."
And he said, "So I conclude that, in many ways, leadership is like a panicle of rice.

Because at the height of the season, at the height of its powers, it's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world, it reaches to the heavens."
We've shared wine and food and other sorts of fabulous experiences in coffee bars in Amsterdam.
We've also shared other sorts of entertainment -- sports arenas, public parks, concert halls, libraries, universities.
All these things are share-platforms, but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what I refer to as the "mother of all share-platforms."
The other thing that's worth considering is that we've made a huge investment over decades and decades, and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our inheritance.
It's a physical infrastructure that allows us to get from point A to point B and move things that way.
It's also -- Web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems, and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance.
Basically Zipcar is the largest car-sharing company in the world.
They did not invent car-sharing.
Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe.
Zipcar got some really important things right.
First, they really understood that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.
And so they were very clever about the way that they packaged car-sharing.
So for this reason, I think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that, if we squeeze hard on things that we've thrown away, there's a lot of value in those things.
What set up with Zipcar -- Zipcar started in 2000.
In the last year, 2010, two car companies started, one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar, and the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.
It took them six years to get 1,000 cars in service.
WhipCar, which started April of last year, it took them six months to get 1,000 cars in the service.
So, really interesting.
So that's how it all started.
PM: So how large is the collection?
MA: Pretty big.

It's now traveling.
I get there, and there are six other women, out of 183.
So the countries that had women representatives were Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines, Trinidad Tobago, Jamaica, Lichtenstein and me.
So being an American, I decided to set up a caucus.
It's Monday morning.
In Washington, the president of the United States is sitting in the Oval Office, assessing whether or not to strike Al Qaeda in Yemen.
At Number 10 Downing Street, David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double-dip recession.

Our face is hugely important because it's the external, visual part that everybody else sees.
We have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body: the brain.
It's where our senses are located, our special senses -- our vision, our speech, our hearing, our smell, our taste.
And this bone is peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull with cavities, the sinuses, which warm and moisten the air we breathe.
That's the good news.
However, his chin skin doesn't look the same as it did before.
It's skin from his back.
But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives.
What does that mean?
They have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy.
It is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves.
Mau was, in fact, gathering explicit data using his entire body.
It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old.

And what he meant was, if you are voyaging and far from home, your very survival depends on everyone aboard.
You cannot make the voyage alone, you were never meant to.
This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable.
It always was.
So in closing I would offer you this: The planet is our canoe, and we are the voyagers.
True navigation begins in the human heart.
This is the great frontier.
But it has its limitations.
And in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body, and if that were only true, it would be great, but it's not.
But it has its limitations.
And in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body, and if that were only true, it would be great, but it's not.
It's like the parts list of your body.
I can make them healthy."
And there probably are special cases of that.
You could certainly tell the difference between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant by what they had in a larder.
So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person by looking at their ingredients list.
But you really for the most part can't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person -- except in some of these special cases.
So why all the big deal about genetics?
It is very useful in certain circumstances.
It's also the great theoretical triumph of biology.
It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right.
And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct.
So Mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing, and Darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing, and then Watson and Crick actually looked and found one.
So this happens in physics all the time.
So this happens in physics all the time.
You predict a black hole, and you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said.
But it rarely happens in biology.
We overlay them. This is actual data.
And you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow, but there's some things that just Alice has and some things that just Bob has.
And if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug, we see that in the blood, they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug.
And so those tumors, those are symptoms of cancer.
And so your body is probably cancering all the time, but there are lots of systems in your body that keep it under control.
And so to give you an idea of an analogy of what I mean by thinking of cancering as a verb, imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing, and the way that we talked about it, we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen and we'd say, "Oh, my house has water."

We might divide it -- the plumber would say, "Well, where's the water?"

"Well, it's in the kitchen." "Oh, you must have kitchen water."
What an exciting and inspiring event.
What you just heard is "Skylife" by David Balakrishnan.
We want to play you one more selection.
And then you have Yemen.
And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of, "How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?"
I want to tell you something, that the Internet and connectivity has created [a] new mindset.
And this is what the story's all about.
CA: There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical, or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos.
You really believe that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now, that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly?
And I did my first "expo de rue," which means sidewalk gallery.
And I framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising.
I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine.
The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you."
We said, "Okay, let's try and push as far as we can."
I love the way that people will ask me, "How big will my photo be?"
And most of them couldn't say.
We even pasted on Israeli military towers, and nothing happened.
When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.
And the army took them, and instead of bringing them to the police station, they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces.
I was shocked.
All Brazil was shocked.
They kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project?
Are you an NGO? Are you the media?"
Art. Just doing art.
Some people question, "Why is it in black and white?
Don't you have color in France?"
Or they tell you, "Are these people all dead?"
You might have seen images about the post-election violence that happened there in 2008.
This time we covered the roofs of the houses, but we didn't use paper, because paper doesn't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house -- vinyl does.
Then art becomes useful.
It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not.
The importance is what you do with the images, the statement it makes where it's pasted.
So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.
Art is not supposed to change the world, to change practical things, but to change perceptions.
Art can change the way we see the world.
Art can create an analogy.
Most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends, and that creates a huge challenge.
In fact, this is the forecast picture.
There are various things in here: I could say we might raise more revenue, or medical innovation will make the spending even higher.
So the concept here: so if you do have a deceased or injured organ, we take a very small piece of that tissue, less than half the size of a postage stamp.
We then tease the cells apart, we grow the cells outside the body.
We then take a scaffold, a biomaterial -- again, looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt -- we then shape that material, and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time -- very much like baking a layer cake, if you will.
You see a scanner technology that first scans the wound on the patient and then it comes back with the printheads actually printing the layers that you require on the patients themselves.
This is how it actually works.
Here's the scanner going through, scanning the wound.
I was able to wrestle in high school.
I became the captain of the team, and that was great.
I was able to be a normal kid with my friends.
We actually just got "middle class" in Colorado Springs, Colorado, but you get the picture.
I was raised with a very heavy sense of unfinished legacy.
At this ripe old age of 30, I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible, beautiful time, and I've decided, for me, it's been a real journey and paradox.
Now I tell you this -- I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself, because I think part of the work of feminism is to admit that aesthetics, that beauty, that fun do matter.
There are lots of very modern political movements that have caught fire in no small part because of cultural hipness.
Anyone heard of these two guys as an example?
The activists I interviewed had nothing in common, literally, except for one thing, which was that they all cited their mothers as their most looming and important activist influences.
So often, particularly at a young age, we look far afield for our models of the meaningful life, and sometimes they're in our own kitchens, talking on the phone, making us dinner, doing all that keeps the world going around and around.
My mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory, or certainty, or security even.

It's about acting in the face of overwhelm.
So our model is: learn math the way you'd learn anything, like riding a bicycle.
Stay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle.
Do it as long as necessary, until you have mastery.
So our model is: learn math the way you'd learn anything, like riding a bicycle.
Stay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle.
Do it as long as necessary, until you have mastery.
And the idea is, from this we can actually teach everything -- well, everything that can be taught in this type of a framework.
So you can imagine -- and this is what we are working on -- from this knowledge map, you have logic, you have computer programming, you have grammar, you have genetics, all based off of that core of, if you know this and that, now you're ready for this next concept.
Now that can work well for an individual learner, and I encourage you to do it with your kids, but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself.
And you can see, eventually they were able to get 10 in a row.
It's almost like you can see them learning over those last 10 problems.
They also got faster -- the height is how long it took them.
So it's all been teacher-driven. It's been pretty crazy.
BG: Is this ready for prime time?
Do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out?
Do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out?
SK: Yeah, it's ready.
We've got a million people on the site already, so we can handle a few more.
And Zuckerberg said, "A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa."
And I want to talk about what a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like.
So when I was growing up in a really rural area in Maine, the Internet meant something very different to me.
So when I was growing up in a really rural area in Maine, the Internet meant something very different to me.
It meant a connection to the world.
It meant something that would connect us all together.
There are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization.
Yahoo News, the biggest news site on the Internet, is now personalized -- different people get different things.
Huffington Post, the Washington Post, the New York Times -- all flirting with personalization in various ways.
And instead of a balanced information diet, you can end up surrounded by information junk food.
What this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the Internet wrong.
In a broadcast society -- this is how the founding mythology goes -- in a broadcast society, there were these gatekeepers, the editors, and they controlled the flows of information.
In 1915, it's not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities.
Then people noticed that they were doing something really important.
a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information, that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter, and then journalistic ethics developed.
But we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life, a sense of civic responsibility.
We need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters.
And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't.
And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't.
Because I think we really need the Internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being.
We need it to connect us all together.
And there's our nanny by the door.
Nanny: You want water?  Nanny: All right.  DR: She offers water, and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water.
And what we've done is use the word "water" to tag that moment, that bit of activity.
Well, it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like Montana.
In short, there was a lot of water and there weren't very many people.
But as more people showed up wanting water, the folks who were there first got a little concerned, and in 1865, Montana passed its first water law.
It's a broken system.
You've got a disincentive to conserve, because if you don't use your water right, you risk losing your water right.
Well, we decided to connect these two worlds -- the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks.
You've got a disincentive to conserve, because if you don't use your water right, you risk losing your water right.
Well, we decided to connect these two worlds -- the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks.
In some states, senior water rights holders can leave their water in-stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right.
The brewers pay to restore water to the stream.
It provides a simple, inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems, while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them.
After 140 years of conflict and 100 years of dry streams, a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved, we put together a market-based, willing buyer, willing seller solution -- a solution that does not require litigation.
You can see it in the way we raise our young kids.
You go to an elementary school at three in the afternoon and you watch the kids come out, and they're wearing these 80-pound backpacks.
If the wind blows them over, they're like beetles stuck there on the ground.
One of my favorite is that people named Dennis are disproportionately likely to become dentists, people named Lawrence become lawyers, because unconsciously we gravitate toward things that sound familiar, which is why I named my daughter President of the United States Brooks.
Another finding is that the unconscious, far from being dumb and sexualized, is actually quite smart.
So one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture.

It's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house.
We believe that reason is the highest of the faculties.
But I think this research shows that the British Enlightenment, or the Scottish Enlightenment, with David Hume, Adam Smith, actually had a better handle on who we are -- that reason is often weak, our sentiments are strong, and our sentiments are often trustworthy.
And this work corrects that bias in our culture, that dehumanizing bias.
The third is what you might call sympathy, the ability to work within groups.
And that comes in tremendously handy, because groups are smarter than individuals.
And face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically, because 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal.
And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen, and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.
But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe.
And it would be self-illuminated, because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light -- so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole.
This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.
Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.
But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict.
This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.

Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.

If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.

If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.
And we can predict what the sound will be.
And we can predict what the sound will be.
We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.
And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.
It gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.
It's like hurry, build your instruments.
It's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ...
And you enter that space, and you feel like, "Wow! This is so impressive," just because of this focal point, this huge light source in the middle.
To me, it is something from theater, and I will get back to that a little bit later.
It's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus.
And you can imagine a lot more applications.
But I would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life.
So light is, of course, for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us.
So light is, of course, for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us.
It is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other.
And it is all about this planet.
But when you look at this planet at night, it looks like this.
And I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today.
Because all this light here goes up to the sky.
Because all this light here goes up to the sky.
It never reaches the ground where it was meant for.
It never is to the benefit of people.
It's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps.
And of course, we had the metal-halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that.
Now we have LED, but here you see the latest one, and you see how incredibly small it is.
And of course, we had the metal-halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that.
Now we have LED, but here you see the latest one, and you see how incredibly small it is.
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity, because this tiny, tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it.

Now we have LED, but here you see the latest one, and you see how incredibly small it is.
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity, because this tiny, tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it.
Now, this is not very pleasant and comfortable.
And for that reason, we cover the LED with a phosphor cap.
And the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant.
And it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity is very important here.
In all of these examples, I think, we should start making the light out of darkness, and use the darkness as a canvas -- like the visual artists do, like Edward Hopper in this painting.
I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting.
I think, when I see it, I start to think, who are those people?
Where have they come from? Where are they going?
What just happened? What will be happening in the next five minutes?

If I should have a daughter, instead of "Mom," she's going to call me "Point B," because that way she knows that no matter what happens, at least she can always find her way to me.
And I'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say, "Oh, I know that like the back of my hand."
Or else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place, to see if you can change him.
But I know she will anyway, so instead I'll always keep an extra supply of chocolate and rain boots nearby, because there is no heartbreak that chocolate can't fix.
Okay, there's a few that chocolate can't fix.
And no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute, be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life.
And yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting, I am pretty damn naive.
But I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar.

I discovered this bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic, and my bewildered, but supportive, parents took me to soak in every ounce of spoken word that I could.
I was the youngest by at least a decade, but somehow the poets at the Bowery Poetry Club didn't seem bothered by the 14-year-old wandering about.
In fact, they welcomed me.
It's not that I think that spoken-word poetry is the ideal art form.
I'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story.
I write musicals; I make short films alongside my poems.
And that is an amazing realization to have, especially when you're 14.
Plus, now with YouTube, that connection's not even limited to the room we're in.
I'm so lucky that there's this archive of performances that I can share with my students.

I was only four years old when I saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life.
That was a great day for my mother.
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid.
And they are now making them, and someday, perhaps pretty soon, you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket.
This is a geep, a goat-sheep hybrid.
There is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA -- that controls genetically-engineered pets.
And so some states have decided to allow them, some states have decided to ban them.
Some of you may have read about the FDA's consideration right now of genetically-engineered salmon.
And so some states have decided to allow them, some states have decided to ban them.
Some of you may have read about the FDA's consideration right now of genetically-engineered salmon.
The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon, using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat, to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed.
And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology -- a question that we're not really sure yet how to solve.
This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach.
And what they've done here is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top, and it's on a big computer tracking ball.
They can't actually make them land.
They put them about one inch above the ground, and then they shut everything off and they go pfft.
But it's the closest they can get to a landing.
They put them about one inch above the ground, and then they shut everything off and they go pfft.
But it's the closest they can get to a landing.
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed that this creature -- this is a moth -- this is the moth in its pupa stage, and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology, so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth, it is already prewired.
So now we have organic computer chips made out of living, self-aggregating neurons.
Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact, independent lamprey eel brain.

It is living -- fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides, attached photosensitive sensors to the brain, put it into a cart -- here's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle -- and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart, when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart, the cart moves toward the light;
He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin, put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being.
Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation.
This is where we are in this process.
Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want?
Do we have free reign to design animals?
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say, "Look, I want a dog.
The emotions can flow from me to you and back.
It's an extremely profound experience.
There's a piece by a composer, an American composer called John Cage.
It's an extremely profound experience.
There's a piece by a composer, an American composer called John Cage.
It's called "Aria."
And the singer, within this structure, has total freedom to be creative, spontaneous.
For example, there are different colors and each color gets a different type of singing -- pop, country and western, opera, jazz -- and you just have to be consistent with that color.
You see there are different lines.
There's Armenian, Russian, French, English, Italian.
So within this structure, one is free.
To me, this piece is an ode to the voice, because it's mysterious, as we can see.
And now the children in his village get the same grades at school as the children who have electricity at home.
When he received his award, he said these lovely words: "The children can lead Africa from what it is today, a dark continent, to a light continent."
A simple idea, but it could have such far-reaching consequences.
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark.
Let us celebrate diversity.
Mind your language.
Adrian Kohler: Well, we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse.
Basil Jones: But actually we're going to start this evolution with a hyena.
AK: The ancestor of the horse.
AK: The ancestor of the horse.
Okay, we'll do something with it.
Hahahaha.
And in a way that's a metaphor for life.
BJ: So every moment it's on the stage, it's making the struggle.
So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology --  to turn nouns into verbs.
So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology --  to turn nouns into verbs.
AK: Well actually I prefer to say that it's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life.
BJ: Okay so.
And, in fact, it took about 10 years to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa, where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry, to learn a renewed, or a new, respect for this art form.
AK: So in 1981, I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company.
And 20 years later, miraculously, we collaborated with a company from Mali, the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako, where we made a piece about a tall giraffe.
The horse is sold to the First World War, and he joins up to find his horse.
BJ: So Tom gave us a call and said, "Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre?"
AK: It seemed a lovely idea.
BJ: So Tom gave us a call and said, "Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre?"
AK: It seemed a lovely idea.
BJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider.
But we didn't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator, because we couldn't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time.
AK: We started work on the prototype after the model was approved, and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated.
We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.
AK: A month later, we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us.
BJ: About 40 people.
AK: We were terrified.
AK: A month later, we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us.
BJ: About 40 people.
AK: We were terrified.
And together, there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression.
AK: You want to say something about the breathing?
BJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.
He made sure that everything lined up.
And then we posted this video to YouTube about a year and a half ago.
This is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir.
So there's more. There's more.
Thank you so much.
And I had the same reaction you did.
Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen?
Someone did all eight videos -- a bass even singing the soprano parts.
This is Beau Awtin.
We're not finished with the video yet.
You can imagine, with 2,000 synchronized YouTube videos, the render time is just atrocious.
But we do have the first three minutes.
It's like a wall to the electricity.
If I place that between, now all the dough is touching, but if I stick that light back in, I have light.
In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures.
I have no idea whether it makes any difference, but he seemed to make sense, and I wasn't going to test the hypothesis that he'd be wrong.
And then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open.
If you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute -- you've got a whole new problem set.
You can't delay that much.
And you really can't decide where you hit very much, because they pretend you can steer, but you're being delivered.
So you look around, where you're going to land, you try to make yourself ready.
It was men, women, young, old -- not just from military; from different organizations, many of them detailed to us just from a handshake.
And so instead of giving orders, you're now building consensus and you're building a sense of shared purpose.
Probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference, the ages, had changed so much.
It's a promise.
Every Ranger promises every other Ranger, "No matter what happens, no matter what it costs me, if you need me, I'm coming."
And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger.
Every Ranger promises every other Ranger, "No matter what happens, no matter what it costs me, if you need me, I'm coming."

Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful.
And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger.
Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful.
It's probably more powerful than marriage vows.
Compassion is fun.
And that mind-blowing insight changes the entire game.
Because if compassion was a chore, nobody's going to do it, except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.
It's a company that thrives on idealism.
And maybe because of that, compassion is organic and widespread company-wide.
In Google, expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern.
And maybe because of that, compassion is organic and widespread company-wide.
In Google, expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern.
It's sort of a funny pattern.
It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something.
And they don't usually ask for permission; they just go ahead and do it, and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.
And sometimes it gets big enough to become official.
But again, fun is not enough.
There are also real business benefits.
So what are they?
The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good.
In other words, compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.
And this is the first compelling business benefit.
And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell.
But can I just tell you, the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet is determined by a triangle.
Have you ever tried to see that if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes?
And you know, the extraordinary part of it is I just simply had no answers.
I had lost my belief.
Look where my belief had brought me to.


Thank you.

First, a video.
Yes, it is a scrambled egg.
Imagine the darkest, emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are.
And then suddenly, bang! A universe appears, an entire universe.
And we've crossed our first threshold.
And then suddenly, bang! A universe appears, an entire universe.
And we've crossed our first threshold.
The universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom.
And we've crossed our first threshold.
The universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom.
It's incredibly hot.
The universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom.
It's incredibly hot.
It contains everything that's in today's universe, so you can imagine, it's busting.
And it's expanding at incredible speed.
And at first, it's just a blur, but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur.
Within the first second, energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity.
That's twice as long as humans have been on this planet.
And now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium.
Now I want to pause for a moment, 380,000 years after the origins of the universe, because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage.
And now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium.
Now I want to pause for a moment, 380,000 years after the origins of the universe, because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage.
We know above all that it was extremely simple.
And the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex.
Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds.
When very large stars die, they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations, to form all the elements of the periodic table.
Each rung contains information.
So, DNA contains information about how to make living organisms.
And DNA also copies itself.
Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago.
And I believe we count as a threshold in this great story.
Let me explain why.
And the same weapons are still here, and they are still armed.
If we avoid that trap, others are waiting for us.
We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years.
We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years.
So what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us, but it can also show us our power with collective learning.
And now, finally -- this is what I want.
It's an article about a theater performance, and it starts with basic information about where it is, in case you actually want to go and see it after you've read the article -- where, the time, the website.
Same with this -- it's a movie review, an art review, a book review -- where the reading is in case you want to go.
A restaurant -- you might not want to just read about it, maybe you want to go to the restaurant.
So they tell you where it is, what the prices are, the address, the phone number, etc.
Then you get to their political articles.
Here's a great article about an important election race that's happening.
It's an ongoing process your whole life.
But most importantly, it's voluntary.
It's voluntary.
I heard him come in.
I remained under the blankets. He entered my room, sat on the corner of the bed, and he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head, and when he saw me he started laughing.
He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.

He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.
Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?"
I had become a mother and he was celebrating his 77th birthday, and suddenly I was very, very afraid.
I feared he'd go and take his silences with him, and take his secrets with him.
I managed to convince him that it was important for us, but possibly also for other people that he shared his story.
For several days now, we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED.
I used to be able to talk like that.
Maybe I wasn't as smart, but I was at least as talkative.
"It was the clearest I could find.
Then Apple released the Alex voice, which was the best I'd heard.
It knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark.
Roger 2.0: Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is to be back on your show.
We have been talking for a long time, and now here we are again.
This is the first version of my computer voice.
It makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on "Casablanca" and "Citizen Kane."
This is the first voice they've created for an individual.
There are several very good voices available for computers, but they all sound like somebody else, while this voice sounds like me.
The world presented me with options, and I took them.
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle.
So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming.

So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming.
I bought a tractor -- then it broke.
It all begins with empathy.
Take yourself out of your shoes, put yourself into the shoes of another person."
Here, I'll give you an example.
And the soldiers are Chinese, and everybody else is Chinese.
As an American, how do you feel about this picture?
What do you think about that scene?
They don't have access to the same information that we do, and when we generously share that information with them, they're going to see the light and come on over to our team.
When that doesn't work, when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us, then we move on to a second assumption, which is that they're idiots.
They have all the right pieces of the puzzle, and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.
It's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds.
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing.
That is not true, and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing.

Why is this old table in your office?"
And she told me, she said, "You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia, in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia, and this table was in my grandfather's kitchen.
And we'd come in from playing, he'd come in from plowing and working, and we'd sit around that table every night.

And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table, I began to call it the wisdom table.

And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office, and it reminds me of him.
It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes."
The project I'm going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game, and essentially it is also an empty space.
He proposed the film to me -- it's a great title.
He proposed the film to me, and I said, "Yeah, maybe it'll be on local TV, and we can say hi to our friends."
But the film has really gone places.
You know the one.
"And I'm not even talking about you behind me, because I've got eyes in the back of my head."
You know that teacher?
I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies.
So I thought, well they like to play games.
I'll make something -- I didn't say interactive; we didn't have that term in 1978 -- but something interactive.
So I thought, well they like to play games.
I'll make something -- I didn't say interactive; we didn't have that term in 1978 -- but something interactive.
And so we made the game, and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure.
And each country has a cabinet.
There's a Prime Minister, Secretary of State, Minister of Defense and a CFO, or Comptroller.
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them.
And so we had this situation come up -- last summer actually, at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County -- and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said, "Mr. Hunter, let's ask -- there's a parent over there."
There was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room.
"Let's ask that mom to read the letter.
I would like to talk today about what I think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon, which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it.
My own interest in this subject, and my passion for it, began rather accidentally.
I had bought a copy of this book, "The Universe and Dr. Einstein" -- a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle.
My own interest in this subject, and my passion for it, began rather accidentally.
I had bought a copy of this book, "The Universe and Dr. Einstein" -- a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle.
A few years after that, in Bangalore, I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night, and I picked up this book, thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes.
And as it happened, I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot.
And I was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do.
And that feeling hasn't left me yet.
So it took me from places like Chile -- the Atacama Desert in Chile -- to Siberia, to underground mines in the Japanese Alps, in Northern America, all the way to Antarctica and even to the South Pole.
And today I would like to share with you some images, some stories of these trips.
I have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting, literally at times, their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe.
There is another way to search for dark matter, which is indirectly.
If dark matter exists in our universe, in our galaxy, then these particles should be smashing together and producing other particles that we know about -- one of them being neutrinos.
And neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules.
The reason why they have to work in winter is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring, which, if they did that, they would need ships and submersibles to do their work.
So they wait until winter -- the lake is completely frozen over -- and they use this meter-thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work.
So this is the Russians working on the ice in the peak of the Siberian winter.
So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.
That's an American C-17 cargo plane that flew us from New Zealand to McMurdo in Antarctica.
And here we are about to board our bus.
For instance, here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind, which is eventually going to be filled up with helium.
Those two trucks you see at the very end carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium.
Now, in case the weather changes before the launch, they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to McMurdo Station.
Now, in case the weather changes before the launch, they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to McMurdo Station.
And this particular balloon, because it has to launch two tons of weight, is an extremely huge balloon.
The fabric alone weighs two tons.

In order to minimize the weight, it's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper.

In politics also, there are different opinions.
A lot of times, these trade-offs are about more than just security, and I think that's really important.
Now people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs.
But if you know stuff, you're more likely to have your feelings match reality.
Enough real world examples helps.
Now we all know the crime rate in our neighborhood, because we live there, and we get a feeling about it that basically matches reality.
There's no feeling about germs.
You need a model to understand them.
So this model is an intelligent representation of reality.
So this model is an intelligent representation of reality.
It's, of course, limited by science, by technology.
We couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them.
For us, we're very facile around electricity.
We change light bulbs without even thinking about it.
Our model of security around electricity is something we were born into.
Or think of the risks on the Internet across generations -- how your parents approach Internet security, versus how you do, versus how our kids will.
Models eventually fade into the background.
Intuitive is just another word for familiar.
So as your model is close to reality, and it converges with feelings, you often don't know it's there.
So a nice example of this came from last year and swine flu.
When swine flu first appeared, the initial news caused a lot of overreaction.
Now it had a name, which made it scarier than the regular flu, even though it was more deadly.
And people thought doctors should be able to deal with it.
So there was that feeling of lack of control.
There was no new data, but there was less fear.
By autumn, people thought the doctors should have solved this already.
And there's kind of a bifurcation -- people had to choose between fear and acceptance -- actually fear and indifference -- they kind of chose suspicion.
And you see agenda -- this is marketing, this is politics -- trying to convince you to have one model versus another, trying to convince you to ignore a model and trust your feelings, marginalizing people with models you don't like.
This is not uncommon.
An example, a great example, is the risk of smoking.
We can do to the next harvest.
We can often do until our kids grow up.
But 80 years, we're just not good at.
Some of this stuff is hard.
I mean really though, information seems like our best hope.
And I lied.
But in the long-term, both feeling and reality are important.
And I want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this.
1982 -- I don't know if people will remember this -- there was a short epidemic of Tylenol poisonings in the United States.
What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did, in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure, using non-toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment?
So that's the vision that I've been thinking about.
And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish?
But what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us?
So here are some examples: these are some natural shells.
There are natural biological materials.
But what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us?
So here are some examples: these are some natural shells.
There are natural biological materials.
Now, going back to the abalone shell, the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins.
These proteins are very negatively charged.
And they can pull calcium out of the environment, put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.
And then it wires itself to the current collector.
And so through a process of selection evolution, we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking, high-powered battery that's all made at room temperature, basically at the bench top.
And that battery went to the White House for a press conference.

I brought it here.
The book starts like this. This is the cover.
As the globe spins, we can see our location, and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book.
Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.
Al Gore: I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they're a beautiful addition to the landscape.
Mike Matas: And so throughout the whole book, Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos.
This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.
This is called a cycle valve tube.
When you pump in air in a bicycle, you use a bit of this.
And some of these models -- so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube, you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint.
If you have three of them, and you loop them together, well you make a triangle.
With four, you make a square, you make a pentagon, you make a hexagon, you make all these kind of polygons.
And they have some wonderful properties.
And they have some wonderful properties.
If you look at the hexagon, for instance, it's like an amoeba, which is constantly changing its own profile.
You can just pull this out, this becomes a rectangle.

This becomes an isosceles triangle -- again, very shaky.
This square might look very square and prim.

This square might look very square and prim.
Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus.
Because triangles are the only rigid structures.
We can't make a bridge with squares because the train would come, it would start doing a jig.
Ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in India, they might not have gone to engineering college, but no one makes a roof placed like this.
Now this, we make lots and lots of pumps.
Now this is a little pump with which you could inflate a balloon.
It's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon.
Whenever current flows through the coil, this becomes an electromagnet.
It's the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin.
We made 30,000.
You're not able to see how the sound is produced, because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth.
I'm going to keep this outside, to blow out. I'm going to suck in air.
So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations.

A huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down.
And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down.
And there's a third one over here.


Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship.
Again, you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air.
And as it's drying, it's compressing, so what you're left with, depending on the recipe, is something that's either like a really light-weight, transparent paper, or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.
And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally, or you can use the wet material to form it around a three-dimensional shape.
Possibly a good performance piece, but definitely not ideal for everyday wear.

100 billion is the only number you need to know.
The age of the universe, between now and the Big Bang, is a hundred billion in dog years.
Which tells you something about our place in the universe.
Because if there had been, they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole.
Keeping the universe very, very smooth at early times is not easy; it's a delicate arrangement.
It's a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly.
You've heard of entropy.
It's the randomness, the disorder, the chaoticness of some systems.
Boltzmann gave us a formula -- engraved on his tombstone now -- that really quantifies what entropy is.
We want to know -- this is 50 years ago, "Surely," you're thinking, "we've figured it out by now."
It's not true that we've figured it out by now.
The reason the problem has gotten worse, rather than better, is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before.
The reason the problem has gotten worse, rather than better, is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before.
We learned that it's accelerating.
The universe is not only expanding.
We learned that it's accelerating.
The universe is not only expanding.
If you look at the galaxy, it's moving away.
It's just the idea that empty space itself has energy.
In every little cubic centimeter of space, whether or not there's stuff, whether or not there's particles, matter, radiation or whatever, there's still energy, even in the space itself.
And this energy, according to Einstein, exerts a push on the universe.
But if there's dark energy, and the dark energy does not go away, the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever.
14 billion years in the past, 100 billion dog years, but an infinite number of years into the future.
Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes, space looks finite to us.
There's a finite region of space that we have access to, surrounded by a horizon.
So even though time goes on forever, space is limited to us.
Finally, empty space has a temperature.
That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century.
He said, well, entropy increases because there are many, many more ways for the universe to be high entropy, rather than low entropy.
But that's a probabilistic statement.
So this scenario makes predictions.
And the predictions are that the fluctuations that make us are minimal.
Even if you imagine that this room we are in now exists and is real and here we are, and we have, not only our memories, but our impression that outside there's something called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy, it's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain than for them actually to randomly fluctuate into Caltech, the United States and the galaxy.
Even if you left our galaxy out, you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies.
And Feynman also understood this.
Feynman says, "From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation, all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before, we will find it mixed up, and not like the piece we've just looked at -- high entropy.
Here is the universe that we tell you about, versus the universe that really exists.
I just showed you this picture.
The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so.
This is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions.
Or maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe.
An egg, an unbroken egg, is a low entropy configuration, and yet, when we open our refrigerator, we do not go, "Hah, how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator."
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse.
And even better, we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations.
This is a prediction. I might be wrong.
It fills me with wonder, and it opens my heart.

When I heard about the vanishing bees, Colony Collapse Disorder, it motivated me to take action.
We depend on pollinators for over a third of the fruits and vegetables we eat.
And many scientists believe it's the most serious issue facing mankind.

All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing.
The snow and the ice were my sandbox, and the Inuit were my teachers.
And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm.
What in the heck was I thinking?
So I had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life, after I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me.
Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses.
♫ If you'd ever been out walking you would know ♫  Paul Nicklen: Thank you very much. The show's not over.
My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop.
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
In that one single piece of ice, you have 300 species of microorganisms.
And in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice, it forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice, and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed, and then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life.
So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden.
Supposedly, science is stating that it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now.
This very whale right here could be over 250 years old.
This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution.
You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac, floating in these icy waters, and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon.
The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked.
All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon.
And he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one.
So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal.
And even in his voice, he goes, "That's a bloody big seal, ya."
So we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat, and there's this monstrous leopard seal.
And even in his voice, he goes, "That's a bloody big seal, ya."
And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth.
And I thought, she's about to bite.
She's about to let me know she's too frustrated with me.
What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display.
In fact, this material you see is clear and transparent.
The components of this material are just water and protein.
So this material is silk.
So the question is, how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia?
The process of discovery, generally, is inspired by nature.
And so we marvel at silk worms -- the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber.
And we take advantage of something that is very simple.
The recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do.
They find their way to self-assemble.
And then you detach the protein and you get this film, as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates.
But I mentioned that the film is also technological.
And so what does that mean?
So it would be able to replicate the information that is on the DVD.
And we can store information that's film with water and protein.
So we tried something out, and we wrote a message in a piece of silk, which is right here, and the message is over there.
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning; the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible.
And you see here a picture of a tissue section.
And so what does that mean, that it's biodegradable and biocompatible?
Have you ever wondered why being around children, who smile so frequently, makes you smile very often?
A recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden found that it's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles.
You ask why?
But he also deeply believed, he truly believed, that if you couldn't explain something simply you didn't understand it.
In the 1950s, people were trying to figure out how superfluid helium worked.
There was a theory.
He would try to visualize it, guided by a small number of simple principles.
The small number of simple principles were very, very simple.
The first one was that when helium atoms touch each other, they repel.
The other fact is that the ground state, the lowest energy state of a quantum system, the wave function is always very smooth -- has the minimum number of wiggles.
So he sat down -- and I imagine he had nothing more than a simple piece of paper and a pencil -- and he tried to write down, and did write down, the simplest function that he could think of which had the boundary conditions that the wave function vanish when things touch and is smooth in between.
He wrote down a simple thing.
He called them partons. He called them partons.
He said, "Just think of it as a swarm of partons moving real fast."
Because they're moving real fast, relativity says the internal motions go very slow.
So how do we do this?
Around 2004, in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth, this vision came to fruition.
There's a certain alga that swims in the wild, and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally.
In its membrane, or its boundary, it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity.
So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins.
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about.
And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear.
This goes back to the Pavlovian days.
It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning -- where a tone ends with a brief shock.
And over time -- in this case, a mouse, which is a good animal model, commonly used in such experiments -- the animal learns to fear the tone.
The animal will react by freezing, sort of like a deer in the headlights.
Now the question is, what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear?
Because the original Routemaster bus that some of you may be familiar with, which had this open platform at the back -- in fact, I think all our Routemasters are here in California now actually.
But they aren't in London.
And so you're stuck on a bus.
But the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform.
So we've been working with Transport for London, and that organization hasn't actually been responsible as a client for a new bus And so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work.
The brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy.
And openings seemed -- everyone loves opening bridges, but it's quite a basic thing.
I think we all kind of stand and watch.
But the bridges that we saw that opened and closed -- I'm slightly squeamish -- but I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball.
That just taking a field and banging all these things out isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work.
So we looked at how we could compose all those elements -- instead of just litter, create one composition.
And what we found -- this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain.
Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference.
And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a cost-effective way of making a structure to do this.
The finished project is meant to be more than just a power station.
And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a cost-effective way of making a structure to do this.

It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top.
So we're building these buildings.
They're actually identical, so it's quite cost-effective.
They're just chopped at different heights.
TH: These are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure.
So there were 66,000 of these.
This optic was 22 feet long.
This optic was 22 feet long.
And so the daylight was just coming -- it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed.
Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy.
Now most of the time, you think of pain as a symptom of a disease, and that's true most of the time.
It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation.
But about 10 percent of the time, after the patient has recovered from one of those events, pain persists.
It persists for months and oftentimes for years, and when that happens, it is its own disease.
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it, I want to show you how it feels for my patients.
So imagine, if you will, that I'm stroking your arm with this feather, as I'm stroking my arm right now.
She was 16 years old last year when I met her, and she aspired to be a professional dancer.
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals, she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist.
Now you would probably imagine, as she did, that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life.
But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story.
This is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain.
You can see that the arm is discolored, purplish in color.
That's crazy, but that's, in fact, what happens with chronic pain.
And that's why pain becomes its own disease.
The nervous system has plasticity.
And it's not a trip that requires light-years of travel, but it's to a place where it's defined by light.
So it's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light.
I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence.
So it's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light.
I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence.
I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs.
Okay.
So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate, a single-celled alga.
So why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light?
So why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light?
Well, it uses it to defend itself from its predators.
The flash is like a scream for help.
The flash is like a scream for help.
It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm, and just like the alarm on your car or your house, it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder, thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away.
There's a lot of animals that use this trick, for example this black dragonfish.
There's a lot of animals that use this trick, for example this black dragonfish.
It's got a light organ under its eye.
It's got a chin barbel.
For example, this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud.
This blinds or distracts the predator.
This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this.
It's phenomenal.
So there's a lot of animals in the open ocean -- most of them that make light.
And we have a pretty good idea, for most of them, why.
Here's another one. This is also a sea pen.
It's got a brittle star hitching a ride.
It's a green saber of light.
And it is an optical cue that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean.
So this scavenger comes in, which is a giant sixgill shark.
And I can't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in, because there's bait right there.
If we start over and simply go the other direction around the bow, we get this, the strong form of the knot.
And if you pull the cords under the knot, you will see that the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe.
This is a stronger knot.
And if you pull the cords under the knot, you will see that the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe.

It will come untied less often.
You mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video?"
So we did exactly that.
We made a music video for one of my favorite bands, Radiohead.
Collaborator Three: For all of the frames to be drawn by fans, each individual frame, it's got a very powerful feeling to it.
Collaborator Four: I've seen everybody from Japan, Venezuela, to the States, to Knoxville, Tennessee.
Collaborator Five: As much as is different from frame to frame, it really is personal.
You're hearing a person's life.
AK: So if you go to the website JohnnyCashProject.com, what you'll see is the video playing above.
And below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project.
And below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project.
So this isn't finished at all, but it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate.
If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails, you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located.
And then this is, again, the abstract version, which ends up getting a little bit crazy.
So the last project I want to talk to you about is another collaboration with Chris Milk.
And this is called "The Wilderness Downtown."
But most importantly, I think, we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the Johnny Cash Project, where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone.
What if we had a very low commitment, but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed?
So the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up.
This is a polio vaccine.
And it's a great thing actually that nobody's had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted.
This is a great technology.
So we're looking for a permanent solution, and this is where we get lucky.
This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary.
This virus can only survive in people.
This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary.
This virus can only survive in people.
It can't live for a very long time in people.
So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely.
What the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on Earth.
Now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this, to eradicating diseases.
One congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every 26 days -- in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs.
And if we can finish polio eradication, the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone.
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after.
And there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries.
So it was a massive effort.
The second challenge we had was -- in contrast to the smallpox vaccine, which was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life -- the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile.
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat, and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it's not potent; it's not going to protect them.
Even then, kids need many doses of the vaccine.
But the third challenge we have -- and probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge -- is that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy -- every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash.
When we started, over 20 years ago, 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus.
Last year, it was 1,000.
And at the same time, the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas.
Last year, it was 1,000.
And at the same time, the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas.
It's been working to help control pandemic flu, SARS for example.
So things were looking very exciting, and then about five years ago, this virus, this ancient virus, started to fight back.
The first problem we ran into was that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus, we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out.
And then to make the matters even worse, the virus started to spread out of these four places, especially northern India and northern Nigeria, into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe, causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades.
The first problem we ran into was that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus, we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out.
And then to make the matters even worse, the virus started to spread out of these four places, especially northern India and northern Nigeria, into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe, causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades.
And then, in one of the most important, tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world, we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have.
Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world.
It leaves their children paralyzed, and it drags their families deeper into poverty, because they're desperately searching and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have, trying in vain to find a cure for their children.
We think children deserve better.
And this started an incredible collaboration with industry, and within six months, we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted, just two years ago, the last two types of polio in the world.
Now June the ninth, 2009, we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine, and it turned out to be a game-changer.
The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had, and we immediately started using this.
Now June the ninth, 2009, we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine, and it turned out to be a game-changer.
The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had, and we immediately started using this.
Well, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production.
And only two years ago, people were saying that this is impossible.
Now remember, northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio.
Over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio -- Uttar Pradesh and Bihar -- 500,000 children every single month.
BA: It's interesting.
We spend right now about 750 million to 800 million dollars a year.
That's what it costs to reach 500 million children.
"Women Without Men" returns to history, but another part of our Iranian history.
It goes to 1953 when American CIA exercised a coup and removed a democratically elected leader, Dr. Mossadegh.
The book is written by an Iranian woman, Shahrnush Parsipur.
The book is written by an Iranian woman, Shahrnush Parsipur.
It's a magical realist novel.
This book is banned, and she spent five years in prison.
This book is banned, and she spent five years in prison.
My obsession with this book, and the reason I made this into a film, is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female -- traditionally, historically in Iran -- and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change, freedom and democracy -- while the country of Iran, equally, as if another character, also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy
and independence from the foreign interventions.
Now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009, as my film is released -- the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran.
What is unbelievably ironic is the period that we tried to depict in the film, the cry for democracy and social justice, repeats itself now again in Tehran.
The green movement significantly inspired the world.
It should be the citizen's decision.
But when I saw that, I said, "Maybe the problem is just an authoritarian culture in the region, and some Muslims have been influenced by that.
But the secular-minded people can be influenced by that.
These Muslim thinkers and intellectuals and statesmen of the 19th century looked at Europe, saw these things.
They said, "Why don't we have these things?"
And they looked back at Islamic tradition, they saw that there are problematic aspects, but they're not the core of the religion, so maybe they can be re-understood, and the Koran can be reread in the modern world.
So about that time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently.
We decided to give it a try, because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?"
We have already an autonomous vehicle.
So to test this crazy idea, we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility.
And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.
Now obviously the driver cannot see, so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.
For that, we use an initial measurement unit.
There's the grandstand now.
And he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him.
Well there comes the first box.
Letters thanking us, but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one: "Now I understand why there is Braille on a drive-up ATM machine."
But sometimes --  But sometimes I also do get -- I wouldn't call it hate mail -- but letters of really strong concern: "Dr. Hong, are you insane, trying to put blind people on the road?
You must be out of your mind."
I'm a big list maker, so I came up with a list.
One of them is to think without pressure.
This is a project we're working on right now with a very healthy deadline.
And from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project.
But also because the content was very close.
In this case, "Keeping a Diary Supports Personal Development" -- I've been keeping a diary since I was 12.
He wants to solve ethics.
He wants objective truths.
If you think that way, you have a Platonist moral framework.
That would be simple. Then we know what to do.
Let's take an example.
Suppose I go up and I say, "I'm going to take your phone."
That would be simple. Then we know what to do.
Let's take an example.
Suppose I go up and I say, "I'm going to take your phone."
And that's uncomfortable.
I know; I spent a lot of my career in artificial intelligence, trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us, that could give us answers.
But they can't.
So imagine that right now you went and you found your musician friend.
And you're telling him what we're talking about, about our whole data revolution and all this -- maybe even hum a few bars of our theme music.
♫ Dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum ♫ Well, your musician friend will stop you and say, "You know, the theme music for your data revolution, that's an opera, that's Wagner.
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.
You all know the story, right.
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park."
And we did find a lot of stuff.
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs, but we found one special Tyrannosaur, and we called it B-rex.
And B-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock.
We found a lot of Tyrannosaurs, but we found one special Tyrannosaur, and we called it B-rex.
And B-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock.
It wasn't a very complete T. rex, and it wasn't a very big T. rex, but it was a very special B-rex.
Medullary tissue is the calcium build-up, the calcium storage basically, when an animal is pregnant, when a bird is pregnant.
So here was the character that linked birds and dinosaurs.
But Mary went further.
It was extraordinary.
But she also found osteocytes, which are the cells that laid down the bones.
And try and try, we could not find DNA, but she did find evidence of proteins.
But she also found osteocytes, which are the cells that laid down the bones.
And try and try, we could not find DNA, but she did find evidence of proteins.
But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.
The cells looked better.
The vessels looked better.
Found the protein collagen.
The vessels looked better.
Found the protein collagen.
I mean, it was wonderful stuff.
"The chicken is not."
as you can imagine.
The chicken is a dinosaur.
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.
We also have transgenesis.
Transgenesis is really cool too.
Transgenesis is really cool too.
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.
That's how people make GloFish.
Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird, still has that very primitive hand.
But as you can see, the pigeon, or a chicken or anything else, another bird, has kind of a weird-looking hand, because the hand is a wing.
But the cool thing is that, if you look in the embryo, as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.
We want to stop that gene from turning on, fusing those hands together, so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand, like the archaeopteryx.
And the same goes for the tails.
Birds have basically rudimentary tails.
And the same goes for the tails.
Birds have basically rudimentary tails.
And so we know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail.
But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.
So that's the other gene we're looking for.
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.
So that's the other gene we're looking for.
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.
So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken, modify it and make the chickenosaurus.
Well, that's a good question.
Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things.
And quite frankly, I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it, he could actually advertise an extra piece.

This story is about taking imagination seriously.
Fourteen years ago, I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet, used the same way for centuries.
Three years and two children later, we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net.
It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built, permanent and had lost nothing in translation.
This intersection had been bland and anonymous.
Next challenge, the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked, could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture?
I didn't know where to begin, but I said yes.
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean.
I couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew.
Its shape was too complex now.
So I replaced the metal armature with a soft, fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.


From all outward appearances, John had everything going for him.
And as we start to integrate this information, we're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies, health and wellness.
There's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate.
And I would argue, in the future, we'll have wearable devices in our clothes, monitoring ourselves 24/7.
There's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate.
And I would argue, in the future, we'll have wearable devices in our clothes, monitoring ourselves 24/7.
And just like we have the OnStar system in cars, your red light might go on -- it won't say "check engine" though.
But the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller.
So a few examples: we're now in the era of "Fantastic Voyage," the iPill.
You can swallow this completely integrated device.
Now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills.
What if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure and in a single therapy to cure hypertension?
This is a new device that is essentially doing that.
Right, I'm an oncologist and I have to say most of what we give is actually poison.
We've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells, the ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse.
So if you think of cancer as a weed, we often can whack the weed away.
Babies play, kids play, adults play.
We don't value play.
In fact, we devalue play.
It's a social gene running through us.
It's a serious gene.
It's 45 years of it that's created what I call the "baba factor."
So what happens?
She passes that virus on to baby, and it takes a really, really, really long time -- as the redwood trees -- for that serious meme to get out of our operating system.
What happens then?
Just play, that's a stupid thing."
We have the serious meme in us.
Well I'm going to say no.
In fact, play improves our work.
Just like there's benefits for humans and animals, there's benefits for play at work.
For example, it stimulates creativity.
Just like there's benefits for humans and animals, there's benefits for play at work.
For example, it stimulates creativity.
It increases our openness to change.
It does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons.
One, play is universal.
There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play, besides the serious meme that we have to kick out.
First of all, you have to believe me.
If you don't believe me, well just go home and think about it some more or something.
Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you, you need to rediscover play.
Let them be on instant messengers.
Let them take long lunches.
Lunch is like the recess for work.
To atomize music culture so that ALL past, present and future genres can be studied and abstracted, live.
And "BeatJazzers" become as common as D.J.'s.
But mostly ...



And you may wonder, how do we know what these sounds are?
How can we tell the difference between the sound of the Sun and the sound of a pulsar?
Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy.
But going from slinging some wire across rooftops in Boston to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the Atlantic Ocean seabed is no easy matter.
And so before long, Bell were looking to new technologies to optimize their revolution.
Radio could carry sound without wires.
They were really listening to the galaxy in high fidelity.
There was a glitch in their soundtrack.
A mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research.
There was a glitch in their soundtrack.
A mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research.
It was in the microwave range, and it appeared to be coming from all directions simultaneously.
No one argues -- we all agree there's a problem.
What we don't agree on is what the problem actually is.
Is it the Zetas? The drug traffickers? The government?
Today, much of Mexican society is in denial of the situation we're going through.
We want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances.
Daily life in our country is, to say the least, under extraordinary, exceptional circumstances.
In the end, Benjamín and Julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together.
So what did they do?
They mobilized the whole community of Le Barón to go to Chihuahua, where they organized a sit-in in the central park of the city.
They can take a man's life.
Anyone can kill me, or you, or you.
But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans.
The idea was to use a computer to learn these patterns, and so we gave the computer the existing texts.
And the computer learned a statistical model of which symbols tend to occur together and which symbols tend to follow each other.
Given the computer model, we can test the model by essentially quizzing it.
Linguistic scripts occupy the middle range.
Now what about the Indus script?
We found that the Indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts.
My students said that I should really seriously consider getting some protection.
Who'd have thought that deciphering could be a dangerous profession?
What does this result really show?
The same thing happens in the case of the Indus script.
The computer found several texts -- two of them are shown here -- that have very unusual patterns.
So for example the first text: there's a doubling of this jar-shaped sign.
And that would explain why we have these strange patterns that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text that are found within the Indus Valley.
This suggests that the same script, the Indus script, could be used to write different languages.
The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the Indus script probably does represent language.
The decipherment of these two scripts enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly.
The Mayans started speaking to us in the 20th century, but the Indus civilization remains silent.
Why should we care?
That's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent.
So that's the place where you really want to cook.
And it's got this funny horn-shaped thing, which as far as I know, again, the first cookbook to ever do this.
Now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh when you get shot -- that's why you shouldn't get shot.
The other amazing thing is, when this ballistics gelatin comes down, it falls back down as a nice block.
Anyway, here's the book.
The plant gets something, and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.
Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way.
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects.
And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar.
And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this."
And sure enough, there's the insect.
And this is the mimic.
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.
Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.
This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot.
But the contrast will look something like that, so standing out a lot from the background.
Here's another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.
From my family looking in from outside, what they're trying to figure out is a different kind of existential question, which is, how far is it going to be possible to bridge from the comatose potential mind that they're looking at to an actual mind, which I define simply as the functioning of the brain that is remaining inside my head.
Now to put this into a broader context, I want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien watching the Earth from outer space, and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television is the Earth channel, and your favorite show is the Human Show.
And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting.
There's the Egyptian god Horus, which symbolizes prosperity, wisdom and health.
And that comes down right way to the present with the dollar bill in the United States, which has on it an eye of providence.
So watching all of this show from outer space, you think we get it, we understand that the most precious resource on the blue planet is our consciousness.
Because it's the first thing we draw; we surround ourselves with images of it; it's probably the most common image on the planet.
But we don't. We take our consciousness for granted.
While I was producing in Los Angeles, I never thought about it for a second.
The horseshoe shape you can see on my skull is where they operated and went inside my brain to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life.
But if you look into the eye of consciousness, that single eye you can see, I'm looking down, but let me tell you how I felt at that point.
I didn't feel empty; I felt everything simultaneously.
Neurological damage, 10 years of rehab, requires a long-term perspective.
But let's take a look behind my eyes.
This is a gamma radiation spec scan that uses gamma radiation to map three-dimensional function within the brain.
Alfred Mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator who's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness, whether to restore hearing to the deaf, vision to the blind or movement to the paralyzed.
And I'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed.
I've brought with me, from Southern California, the FM device.
And I'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed.

This is it being held in the hand.
It weighs less than a gram.
So two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime.
Five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin.

So it goes in and it stays there.
Here are the implantation sites.
Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg.
Simon Lewis: I knew when I was timing this that there wouldn't be time for me to do anything about -- Well this is it. This is the control unit.
And this records every single step I've taken for, ooh, five or six years now.
And this records every single step I've taken for, ooh, five or six years now.

What does it do? Well actually, I'll show you down here.
This down here, if the camera can see that, that is a small antenna.
Underneath my heel, there is a sensor that detects when my foot leaves the ground -- what's called the heel lift.

But this is blinking all the time. It's sending signals in real time.
And if you walk faster, if I walk faster, it detects what's called the time interval, which is the interval between each heel lift.
The other things they've worked on -- I didn't have time to say this in my talk -- is they've restored functional hearing to thousands of deaf people.
I could tell you the story: this was going to be an abandoned technology, but Alfred Mann met the doctor who was going to retire, [Dr. Schindler.] And he was going to retire -- all the technology was going to be lost, because not a single medical manufacturer would take it on because it was a small issue.
But there's millions of deaf people in the world, and the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now.
And this, this is the implantable generation.
Because what I didn't say in my talk is this is actually exoskeletal.
I should clarify that.
Rebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today.
Technology created by innovative companies will set us all free.
Fast-forward more than two decades: Apple launches the iPhone in China and censors the Dalai Lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the Chinese government for its Chinese app store.
This has a chilling effect on people's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable.
So we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the Internet, which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services.
So the important question, I think, is not this debate over whether the Internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.
And then we moved on into an era in the 19th century with the rise of a European nation-state where identities and allegiances were defined by ethnicity.
So identity was primarily defined by ethnicity, and the nation-state reflected that.
In the age of globalization, we moved on.
Eventually I was detected, of course, in Egypt.
But the way in which I learned to use technology to my advantage was because I was within an extremist organization that was forced to think beyond the confines of the nation-state.
The age of behavior: where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior and identity and allegiances.
And why are democracy aspirants falling behind?
Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this.
And a social movement is comprised, in my view, it's comprised of four main characteristics.
Because it's not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator.
That doesn't guarantee that what comes next will be a society built on democratic values.
But generally, the trends that start in Egypt have historically spread across the MENA region, the Middle East and North Africa region.
Now Archie was a doctor, so he hung around with doctors a lot.
And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot.
Now I'm an economist, I'm not a doctor, but I see the God complex around me all the time in my fellow economists.
And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot.

But a typical Hans Rosling graph: think for a moment, not what it shows, but think instead about what it leaves out.
I mean, have a look at this graph.
This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo.
He's at MIT.
You try out 10 variations on that one.
You see how this works, right?
And after 45 generations, you have this incredible nozzle.

It looks a bit like a chess piece -- functions absolutely brilliantly.
Now this process of trial and error is actually far more common in successful institutions than we care to recognize.
And we've heard a lot about how economies function.
The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy.
You're killing people with your clinical trials. You need to shut it down now.
Shut it down at once."
And there's this huge hubbub.
It's incredibly painful.
And since I started talking about this subject and researching this subject, I've been really haunted by something a Japanese mathematician said on the subject.
So shortly after the war, this young man, Yutaka Taniyama, developed this amazing conjecture called the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture.
And since I started talking about this subject and researching this subject, I've been really haunted by something a Japanese mathematician said on the subject.

And take us through those, and introduce us to another Yemen.
Nadia Al-Sakkaf: Well, I'm glad to be here.
And I would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen.

I love the Internet.
It's true.
It's true.
Think about everything it has brought us.
Think about all the services we use, all the connectivity, all the entertainment, all the business, all the commerce.
And they can afford to watch how we work -- like how security people work -- and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build.
They also use the global nature of Internet to their advantage.
I mean, the Internet is international.
Here, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file, which contains an exploit.
And that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer, it actually takes over your computer and runs code.
Now, if you'll take a look at this image file -- well there's the image header, and there the actual code of the attack starts.
And that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer, it actually takes over your computer and runs code.
Now, if you'll take a look at this image file -- well there's the image header, and there the actual code of the attack starts.
And that code has been encrypted, so let's decrypt it.
And that code has been encrypted, so let's decrypt it.
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97.
You just have to believe me, it is, it is.
And we can go here and actually start decrypting it.
Well the yellow part of the code is now decrypted.
And I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original.
And that's a backdoor which will take over your computer.
But even more interestingly, if we continue decrypting, we'll find this mysterious string, which says O600KO78RUS.
That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature.
So I spoke with the guys at the lab.
And we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs, and one of them mentioned, well, it ends in RUS like Russia.
And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg.
But in retrospect, the destruction of my self was so repetitive that I started to see a pattern.
The self changed, got affected, broken, destroyed, but another one would evolve -- sometimes stronger, sometimes hateful, sometimes not wanting to be there at all.
The self was not constant.
We've created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self.
Look at the industry for self-image and the jobs it creates, the revenue it turns over.
We'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing.
We'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing.
But it's not. It's a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death.
But there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection -- and that thing is oneness, our essence.
I'm earthed in my essence, and my self is suspended.
In those moments, I'm connected to everything -- the ground, the air, the sounds, the energy from the audience.
All my senses are alert and alive in much the same way as an infant might feel -- that feeling of oneness.
I thought I lacked substance, and the fact that I could feel others' meant that I had nothing of myself to feel.
The thing that was a source of shame was actually a source of enlightenment.
And when I realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function, a funny thing happened.
The thing that was a source of shame was actually a source of enlightenment.
And when I realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function, a funny thing happened.
I stopped giving it so much authority.
And when I realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function, a funny thing happened.
I stopped giving it so much authority.
I give it its due.
If we can get under that heavy self, light a torch of awareness, and find our essence, our connection to the infinite and every other living thing.
We knew it from the day we were born.
Let's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness.


This is a photograph by the artist Michael Najjar, and it's real, in the sense that he went there to Argentina to take the photo.
How does that work?"
And to understand that, you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works.
And so -- this is an over-simplification -- but basically, it's not like you can just pass a radar signal right through 156 tons of steel in the sky.

It's not just going to disappear.
If you had bought it at 1.7, it would have been a bargain.
A few hours later, it had gone up to 23.6 million dollars, plus shipping and handling.
And the question is: Nobody was buying or selling anything; what was happening?
They're using Pragmatic Chaos now.
Pragmatic Chaos is, like all of Netflix algorithms, trying to do the same thing.
It's trying to get a grasp on you, on the firmware inside the human skull, so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next -- which is a very, very difficult problem.
But if you're a Wall Street algorithm and you're five microseconds behind, you're a loser.
So if you were an algorithm, you'd look for an architect like the one that I met in Frankfurt who was hollowing out a skyscraper -- throwing out all the furniture, all the infrastructure for human use, and just running steel on the floors to get ready for the stacks of servers to go in -- all so an algorithm could get close to the Internet.
And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system.

And of course, it is, but it's distributed from places.
With the split wing, we get the lift at the upper wing, and we get the propulsion at the lower wing.
Also, we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency.
We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency.
We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency.
So therefore, it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion, from 30 percent up to 80 percent.
Next thing we have to do, we have to control and regulate the whole structure.
What do we learn from that?
We use them metaphorically -- the DNA of a company, the metabolism of a city, and so on -- is that just bullshit, metaphorical bullshit, or is there serious substance to it?
And if that is the case, how come that it's very hard to kill a city?
That is, you ask any generic question about this -- how many trees of a given size, how many branches of a given size does a tree have, how many leaves, what is the energy flowing through each branch, what is the size of the canopy, what is its growth, what is its mortality?
We have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions.
And the idea is can we do the same for this?
And the idea is can we do the same for this?
So the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life, is that it is scalable, it works over an extraordinary range.
This is just a tiny range actually: It's us mammals; we're one of these.
And yet, despite all of that Darwinian evolution and natural selection, they've been constrained to lie on a line.
Something else is going on.
Before I talk about that, I've written down at the bottom there the slope of this curve, this straight line.
And the bottom one is you lot -- super-creatives plotted in the same way.
And what you see is a scaling phenomenon.
But most important in this, the exponent, the analog to that three-quarters for the metabolic rate, is bigger than one -- it's about 1.15 to 1.2.
Six weeks into his prison sentence, van Meegeren confessed.
But he didn't confess to treason.
He said, "I did not sell a great masterpiece to that Nazi.
According to his biographer, "He looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world."
And he killed himself soon afterwards.
He had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually that.
It wasn't just him who was in for a shock.
Once van Meegeren was on trial, he couldn't stop talking.
And he boasted about all the great masterpieces that he himself had painted that were attributed to other artists.
And he boasted about all the great masterpieces that he himself had painted that were attributed to other artists.
In particular, "The Supper at Emmaus" which was viewed as Vermeer's finest masterpiece, his best work -- people would come [from] all over the world to see it -- was actually a forgery.
It was not that painting, but that painting.
It's simple, you tell them they're from McDonald's.
They believe McDonald's food is tastier, and it leads them to experience it as tastier.
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine?
They believe McDonald's food is tastier, and it leads them to experience it as tastier.
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine?
It's very simple: pour it from an expensive bottle.
In front of them on a screen is information about the wine.
Everybody, of course, drinks exactly the same wine.
But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff, parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree.

This was recorded in 1931.
"Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover."
But that was before she got Capgras syndrome.
Then we asked them, "How much would you pay for George Clooney's sweater?"
And the answer is a fair amount -- more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn't adore.
Then we asked other groups of subjects -- we gave them different restrictions and different conditions.
Then we asked other groups of subjects -- we gave them different restrictions and different conditions.
So for instance, we told some people, "Look, you can buy the sweater, but you can't tell anybody you own it, and you can't resell it."
That drops the value of it, suggesting that that's one reason why we like it.

Why should we care?
For most people, if they think about hunger, they don't have to go far back on their own family history -- maybe in their own lives, or their parents' lives, or their grandparents' lives -- to remember an experience of hunger.
I rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience.
And they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity.
And they're doing this at huge scale after President Lula declared his goal of ensuring everyone had three meals a day.
And this zero hunger program costs .5 percent of GDP and has lifted many millions of people out of hunger and poverty.
So in a cocktail party like this, if I say, "David, Sara, pay attention," some of you just sat up.
We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal, and especially our name.
Differencing is another technique we use.
You can use this in listening, in communication.
If you're in any one of those roles -- and I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk -- the acronym is RASA, which is the Sanskrit word for juice or essence.
And RASA stands for Receive, which means pay attention to the person; Appreciate, making little noises like "hmm," "oh," "okay"; Summarize, the word "so" is very important in communication; and Ask, ask questions afterward.
That's too much to ask from most people.
But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully -- connected in space and in time to the physical world around us, connected in understanding to each other, not to mention spiritually connected, because every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation at its heart.
That's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill.

Why is it not taught? It's crazy.
And with these mobile phones, we transmit more than 600 terabytes of data every month.
This is a 6 with 14 zeroes -- a very large number.
And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water.
And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water.
We use it everyday. We use it in our everyday lives now -- in our private lives, in our business lives.
And we even have to be asked sometimes, very kindly, to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons.
And then we have the radio waves, they have the issues I've just mentioned.
And in the middle there, we have this visible light spectrum.
It's light, and light has been around for many millions of years.
And in the middle there, we have this visible light spectrum.
It's light, and light has been around for many millions of years.
And in fact, it has created us, has created life, has created all the stuff of life.
And in fact, it has created us, has created life, has created all the stuff of life.
So it's inherently safe to use.
And wouldn't it be great to use that for wireless communications?
What do we need to do?
The one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs, florescent lights, with this new technology of LED, LED light bulbs.
An LED is a semiconductor. It's an electronic device.

An LED is a semiconductor. It's an electronic device.
And it has a very nice acute property.
And not only integrate a photo detector here, but maybe use the camera inside.
So what happens when I switch on that light?
As you would expect, it's a light, a desk lamp.
So what happens when I switch on that light?
As you would expect, it's a light, a desk lamp.
Put your book beneath it and you can read.
Once again.
Still don't believe?
It is this light that transmits this high-definition video in a split stream.
And if you look at the light, it is illuminating as you would expect.
You don't notice with your human eye.
You don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude that we impress onto this light bulb.
You don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude that we impress onto this light bulb.
It's serving the purpose of illumination, but at the same time, we are able to transmit this data.
And you see, even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver.
It can ignore that constant light, because all the receiver's interested in are subtle changes.
You also have a critical question now, and you say, "Okay, do I have to have the light on all the time to have this working?"
And the answer is yes.
You have lights in an aircraft.
So it's everywhere in a day there is light.
Look around. Everywhere. Look at your smart phone.

Each of you possesses the most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised.
It's a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other people's minds.
It's just that, whereas that device relies on pulses of infrared light, your language relies on pulses, discrete pulses, of sound.
And just as you use the remote control device to alter the internal settings of your television to suit your mood, you use your language to alter the settings inside someone else's brain to suit your interests.
Languages are genes talking, getting things that they want.
Now language's subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship, in books you can't read, phrases you can't use and words you can't say.
In fact, the Tower of Babel story in the Bible is a fable and warning about the power of language.
According to that story, early humans developed the conceit that, by using their language to work together, they could build a tower that would take them all the way to heaven.
And most importantly for this, it'll tell us why we have language.
And the reason that dilemma arose is, it turns out, that social learning is visual theft.
If I can learn by watching you, I can steal your best ideas, and I can benefit from your efforts, without having to put in the time and energy that you did into developing them.
Now we have to counter that, though, against the evidence we've heard that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans.
Okay, this tendency we have, this seemingly natural tendency we have, towards isolation, towards keeping to ourselves, crashes head first into our modern world.
This remarkable image is not a map of the world.
This remarkable image is not a map of the world.
In fact, it's a map of Facebook friendship links.
And when you plot those friendship links by their latitude and longitude, it literally draws a map of the world.
There are many, many ways of imprinting CDs or DVDs, but those are all being standardized as well.
And you can probably think of many, many more in your own everyday lives.
And so our modern world now is confronting us with a dilemma.
Mark Pagel: This is a very good question.
So many of you will be familiar with the idea that there's this gene called FOXP2 that seems to be implicated in some ways in the fine motor control that's associated with language.
The reason why I don't believe that tells us that the Neanderthals had language is -- here's a simple analogy: Ferraris are cars that have engines.
The data points that are closer together have microbial communities that are more similar than data points that are far apart.
And the first things that you can see from this graph is, if you look at the blue data points, which are the mechanically ventilated air, they're not simply a subset of the green data points, which are the outdoor air.
What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans.
It scared me, it energized me, and then I became a driven person, a driven vagina.
I began to see my body like a thing, a thing that could move fast, like a thing that could accomplish other things, many things, all at once.
I began to see my body like an iPad or a car.

I didn't heed it; no, I organized it and I directed it.
I heard about women being molested in their beds, flogged in their burqas, left for dead in parking lots, acid burned in their kitchens.
Some women became quiet and disappeared.
Other women became mad, driven machines like me.
Other women became mad, driven machines like me.
In the middle of my traveling, I turned 40 and I began to hate my body, which was actually progress, because at least my body existed enough to hate it.
Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated.

It was proof that I had not measured up, that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape.

It was proof that I had not measured up, that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape.
My stomach was proof that I had failed, that it had failed me, that it was broken.
All the stories began to bleed together.
The raping of the Earth, the pillaging of minerals, the destruction of vaginas -- none of these were separate anymore from each other or me.
Militias were raping six-month-old babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and coltan for their iPhones and computers.
In my second chemo, my mother got very sick and I went to see her.
And in the name of connectedness, the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved Gulf of Mexico.
So we brought her home, and I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach before she died.
And as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head, I realized that it held the best and the worst of us.
It was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion.
It was all the lies that got told before and after.
So penguins learn from previous experience, too.
So all of those penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned from their bodies.
It would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin.
When you clean a penguin, you first have to spray it with a degreaser.
And this brings me to my favorite story from the Treasure rescue.
About a year prior to this oil spill, a 17-year-old student had invented a degreaser.
Could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on?
Because it's obviously incredibly frightening.
But I realized that, having been messing around with structure as an actor, that a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough, that there needed to be a mountain to climb, there needed to be a journey that I had to take.
And I wanted it to be the 21st of September because it was my granddad's favorite number.
He was a prisoner of war.
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki.
It never happened.
And I remember thinking, "This is exactly why, actually, we have to work even harder.
And we have to make this day work.
And I left New York freaked, but actually empowered.
And I felt inspired by the possibilities that if it did, then maybe we wouldn't see things like that.
I remember putting that film out and going to cynics.
And then suddenly, I obviously knew at this point, there was a chance.
And days later, 1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping.
And like the General Assembly, obviously the most wonderful, wonderful moment.
And days later, 1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping.
And like the General Assembly, obviously the most wonderful, wonderful moment.
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back.
We put it into Dari and Pashto. We put it in the local dialects.
We went back to Afghanistan, because the next year was coming, and we wanted to support.
But more importantly, we wanted to go back, because these people in Afghanistan were the heroes.
They were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it, etc., etc. -- and they made it real.
And we wanted to go back and show them the film and say, "Look, you guys made this possible. And thank you very much."
And we gave the film over.
That's exactly what we must do.
And on the 21st of September this year, we're going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena to go for that process, to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities.
And we will utilize all kinds of things -- have a dance and social media and visiting on Facebook and visit the website, sign the petition.
It's all about partnerships.
It's about your constituencies; it's about your businesses.
Because together, by working together, I seriously think we can start to change things.
In this image of the Tokyo skyline, I've hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block, the Kepler Mission.
Can you see it?
There we go.
In just over two years of operations, we've found over 1,200 potential new planetary systems around other stars.
To give you some perspective, in the previous two decades of searching, we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler.
When we see these little dips in the light, we can determine a number of things.
To give you some perspective, in the previous two decades of searching, we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler.
When we see these little dips in the light, we can determine a number of things.
For one thing, we can determine that there's a planet there, but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star.
However, these are just the tip of the iceberg.
If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes, we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our Sun's magnetic activity -- the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well.
Just think, even when it's cloudy outside, these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time.

Just think, even when it's cloudy outside, these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time.
I'm showing here Venus, Earth and Mars -- three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size, but only one of which is really a good place to live.
But what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe.
Kepler won't find a planet around every single star it looks at.
That's "Clair De lune."
Its composer, called Debussy, said that art was the greatest deception of all.
Art is a deception that creates real emotions -- a lie that creates a truth.
I said, "What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white?
What would happen then?"
"Oh, don't worry about it," he said.
So an interesting question is, what happened when we met?
What happened to the Neanderthals?
And to begin to answer such questions, my research group -- since over 25 years now -- works on methods to extract DNA from remains of Neanderthals and extinct animals that are tens of thousands of years old.
So this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the DNA, how you convert it to a form you can sequence.
You have to work very carefully to avoid contamination of experiments with DNA from yourself.
And this then, in conjunction with these methods that allow very many DNA molecules to be sequenced very rapidly, allowed us last year to present the first version of the Neanderthal genome, so that any one of you can now look on the Internet, on the Neanderthal genome, or at least on the 55 percent of it that we've been able to reconstruct so far.
So that today, the people living outside Africa have about two and a half percent of their DNA from Neanderthals.
So having now a Neanderthal genome on hand as a reference point and having the technologies to look at ancient remains and extract the DNA, we can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world.
And the first place we've done that is in Southern Siberia in the Altai Mountains at a place called Denisova, a cave site in this mountain here, where archeologists in 2008 found a tiny little piece of bone -- this is a copy of it -- that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky of a human.
So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.
They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.
You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.

All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one.
It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one.
It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems.
So basically you have a chain of elements.
Each element is completely identical, and they're biased.
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
Each element is completely identical, and they're biased.
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.
And there are various facets.
And there's referential and non-referential compassion.
But first, compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering.
For example: A person who is cultivating compassion, when they are in the presence of suffering, they feel that suffering a lot more than many other people do.
However, they return to baseline a lot sooner.
This is called resilience.
However, they return to baseline a lot sooner.
This is called resilience.
Many of us think that compassion drains us, but I promise you it is something that truly enlivens us.
This is called resilience.
Many of us think that compassion drains us, but I promise you it is something that truly enlivens us.
Another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what's called neural integration.
It's a female archetype: she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world.
She stands with 10,000 arms, and in every hand, there is an instrument of liberation, and in the palm of every hand, there are eyes, and these are the eyes of wisdom.
I say that, for thousands of years, women have lived, exemplified, met in intimacy, the archetype of Avalokitesvara, of Kuan-Yin, she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world.
The reason for it, in part, was the extra life boats that were added that made this already unstable ship even more unstable.
And that again proves that when you're talking about unintended consequences, it's not that easy to know the right lessons to draw.
It's really a question of the system, how the ship was loaded, the ballast and many other things.
And that again proves that when you're talking about unintended consequences, it's not that easy to know the right lessons to draw.
It's really a question of the system, how the ship was loaded, the ballast and many other things.
So the 20th century, then, saw how much more complex reality was, but it also saw a positive side.
It's really a question of the system, how the ship was loaded, the ballast and many other things.
So the 20th century, then, saw how much more complex reality was, but it also saw a positive side.
It saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies.
I love things that are alive.
I love manipulating the infrastructure of biology.
But within that infrastructure, we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution.
Is matter evolvable?
Now if we answer those questions in reverse order, the third question -- is matter evolvable? -- if we can answer that, then we're going to know how special biology is, and maybe, just maybe, we'll have some idea of what life really is.
So here's some inorganic life.
And forgive the complicated diagram.
This is just a collection of pathways in the cell.
And the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing.
And you have all these pathways going on at the same time.
You have regulation; information is transcribed; catalysts are made; stuff is happening.
But what does a cell do?
Well it divides, it competes, it survives.
And I think that is where we have to start in terms of thinking about building from our ideas in life.
But what else is life characterized by?
But what else is life characterized by?
Well, I like think of it as a flame in a bottle.
And so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating, metabolizing, burning through chemistries.
Well, I like think of it as a flame in a bottle.
And so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating, metabolizing, burning through chemistries.
And so we have to understand that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life, we need to power it somehow.
So in the 1950s, Miller-Urey did their fantastic chemical Frankenstein experiment, where they did the equivalent in the chemical world.
They took the basic ingredients, put them in a single jar and ignited them and put a lot of voltage through.
And they had a look at what was in the soup, and they found amino acids, but nothing came out, there was no cell.
Does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe?
Is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to compete?
So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution.
So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution.
So you imagine, if we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form, not only will this tell us about the origin of life -- that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive; it can use anything -- we can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies, because we can then use software control for evolution to code in.
So imagine we make a little cell.

So imagine we make a little cell.
We want to put it out in the environment, and we want it to be powered by the Sun.
What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on.
And we don't use design anymore. We find what works.
We should take our inspiration from biology.
I'm an artist and a dad -- second time around.
Thank you.

Burma didn't succeed.
The Philippines didn't succeed.
If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide, there's really no support for the idea that authoritarian governments hold a systematic edge over democracies in terms of economic growth.
And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little.
And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else.
And so I went home, and I made a prototype of this hat.
And so when I make these things, it's really not so much about the object itself, but rather the negative space around the object.
So what happens when a person puts this thing on?
What kind of an experience do they have?
And how are they transformed by wearing it?
So many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves.
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener.
So they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst.
And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences.
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.
So I made a wearable wall that I could wear as a backpack.
And so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me.
And so jumping off of that, thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world, I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls -- which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols.
This very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier.
And so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days, I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit.
And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice.
Is that a big number?
Well, everybody can throw around big numbers.
But in fact, if I were to place one base on each pixel of this 1280x800-resolution screen, we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome.

So anybody who's here today with your significant other, just turn over to them, swab their mouth, send it to the lab and you'll know for sure.
Do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy?
Think of it -- it's 2016, and the leading candidate releases not only her four years of back-tax returns, but also her personal genome.
The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day.
Okay?
Now I happen to make my living these days in television, so for me, that's a good thing.

But a lot of people don't love it so much.
They, in fact, berate it.

They, in fact, berate it.
They call it stupid, and worse, believe me.
You have "All in the Family," "Sanford and Son," and the dominant show -- in the top-10 for the entire 70s -- "MAS*H."
In the entire 50 years of television that we studied, seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War, five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration.
Only one generation, 20 years in, and we discovered, Wow! TV can do that?

It can make me feel this?
If you still don't believe me, we conducted the experiment also in the Korean Peninsula.
And we decided we'd take Koreans in roughly the same geographical place with, notice, the same basic traditional culture, and we divided them in two, and we gave the Northerners communism.
And the result is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in Germany.
And this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago.
Since then, the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions, publishing books.
Now if those books are not lost to history, then they are somewhere in a library, and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by Google, which has scanned 15 million books to date.
Now if those books are not lost to history, then they are somewhere in a library, and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by Google, which has scanned 15 million books to date.
Now when Google digitizes a book, they put it into a really nice format.
Now we've got the data, plus we have metadata.
In 1700, in 1800, in 1900, no one cared.
Through the 30s and 40s, no one cared.
Suddenly, in the mid-40s, there started to be a buzz.
It's kind of like genomics.
Except genomics is a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome.
Culturomics is similar.


Everyone's familiar with cancer, but we don't normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease.
Many of you might be familiar with Taz, the cartoon character, the one that spins around and around and around.
But not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil, and it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial.
A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo.
But not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil, and it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial.
A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo.
The Tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes.
Natural selection is survival of the fittest.
And when you have a population of fast-dividing cancer cells, if one of them acquires new mutations, which allow them to grow more quickly, acquire nutrients more successfully, invade the body, they'll be selected for by evolution.
That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat.
Well the final piece of the puzzle came when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild.
They tend to bite each other, often quite ferociously and usually on the face.
We think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor, get into the saliva.
We think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor, get into the saliva.
When the devil bites another devil, it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil, so the tumor continues to grow.
So this Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer.

It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it.
He discovered this, a huge bleeding tumor at the base of Kimbo's penis.
The vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor, a sexually transmitted cancer that affects dogs.
And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells, so is this dog cancer.
But this dog cancer is quite remarkable, because it spread all around the world.
And in fact, these same cells that are affecting Kimbo here are also found affecting dogs in New York City, in mountain villages in the Himalayas and in Outback Australia.
We also believe this cancer might be very old.
We also believe this cancer might be very old.
In fact, genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old, which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the Neanderthals.
This cancer is remarkable.

It's the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of.
There are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions.
They are visual, auditory, reading and writing and kinesthetic.
Now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it, we have to engage at least two of those modalities, or we have to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience.
And I will go you one further.
Because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form, it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy.
My friends, the doodle has never been the nemesis of intellectual thought.
Laennec, it is said, was walking in the streets of Paris and saw two children playing with a stick.
One was scratching at the end of the stick, another child listened at the other end.
And Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called "the cylinder."
I would feel the abdomen.
I remember so many patients, their names still vivid on my tongue, their faces still so clear.
I remember so many huge, hollowed out, haunted eyes staring up at me as I performed this ritual.

What I want to talk about today is one idea.
It's an idea for a new kind of school, which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking about what schools are for and how they work.
But then by the end of the decade, the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement.
In 1979, I witnessed my first military coup.
We the children had gathered at a friend's house.
Now in 1957, Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain its independence.
In the late 50s, Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP.
I mean, today, Singapore is a First World country and Ghana is not.
And my heart sank, because I thought, here we are again.
Here is another proof that the African is not capable of governing himself.
And not only that, I am documenting it -- documenting my own cultural shortcomings.
A democracy could be upheld peacefully.
It could be, by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace.
Now here's an interesting comparison.
The defeated candidate gave up power and made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle.
I mean, at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy, they did not abuse their power.
The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep, proving that the African is capable of governing himself.
In science, we don't care how many letters you have after your name.
In science, we want to know what your reasons are for believing something.
How do you know that something is good for us or bad for us?
So ideally what you want to do is a trial.
And everybody thinks they're very familiar with the idea of a trial.
Trials are very old. The first trial was in the Bible -- Daniel 1:12.
All the previous trials were positive, and we know this one's gonna be too."
That should always ring alarm bells.
Because if you already know the answer to your trial, you shouldn't be doing one.
Because often we already have a very good treatment that is currently available, so we don't want to know that your alternative new treatment is better than nothing.
We want to know that it's better than the best currently available treatment that we have.
And yet, repeatedly, you consistently see people doing trials still against placebo.
And this is exactly what happened which antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia.
20 years ago, a new generation of antipsychotic drugs were brought in and the promise was that they would have fewer side effects.
So people set about doing trials of these new drugs against the old drugs, but they gave the old drugs in ridiculously high doses -- 20 milligrams a day of haloperidol.
Well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action; it's withheld from doctors and patients.
And this is the most important aspect of the whole story.
It's at the top of the pyramid of evidence.

A father posted his son's picture onto the Internet.
After thousands of resends in relay, the child was found, and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging.
So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years.
And he goes, "Right, that's life too. I know that."
Except, if you think life is also defined by things that die, you're not in luck with this thing, because that's actually a very strange organism.
It grows up into the adult stage like that and then goes through a Benjamin Button phase, and actually goes backwards and backwards until it's like a little embryo again, and then actually grows back up, and back down and back up -- sort of yo-yo -- and it never dies.

And then you see something like that.
And he was like, "My God, what kind of a life form is that?"
Anyone know?
And that explains why that NASA manager was actually in my office to begin with.
Because the idea was that, with concepts like that, maybe we can actually manufacture a form of life.
And so if you go and ask yourself, "What on Earth is artificial life?", let me give you a whirlwind tour of how all this stuff came about.
In fact, they have hackers writing them.
But the idea was taken very quickly a little bit further when a scientist working at the Scientific Institute decided, "Why don't we try to package these little viruses in artificial worlds inside of the computer and let them evolve?"
And this was Steen Rasmussen.
This can be improved upon in so many ways so quickly."
So you see waves of new types taking over the other types.
And this type of activity goes on for quite awhile, until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs.
Here is, in fact, what you get if you, for example, look at the distribution of amino acids on a comet or in interstellar space or, in fact, in a laboratory, where you made very sure that in your primordial soup that there is not living stuff in there.
What you find is mostly glycine and then alanine and there's some trace elements of the other ones.
That is also very robust -- what you find in systems like Earth where there are amino acids, but there is no life.
So the first thing that we learn is that it is possible to define life in terms of processes alone, without referring at all to the type of things that we hold dear, as far as the type of life on Earth is.
And that in a sense removes us again, like all of our scientific discoveries, or many of them -- it's this continuous dethroning of man -- of how we think we're special because we're alive.
Well we can make life. We can make life in the computer.
Granted, it's limited, but we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it.
And once we have that, then it is not such a difficult task anymore to say, if we understand the fundamental processes that do not refer to any particular substrate, then we can go out and try other worlds, figure out what kind of chemical alphabets might there be, figure enough about the normal chemistry, the geochemistry of the planet, so that we know what this distribution would look like in the absence of life,
and then look for large deviations from this -- this thing sticking out, which says, "This chemical really shouldn't be there."

and then look for large deviations from this -- this thing sticking out, which says, "This chemical really shouldn't be there."
Now we don't know that there's life then, but we could say, "Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from."
Now we don't know that there's life then, but we could say, "Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from."
And that might be our chance of actually discovering life when we cannot visibly see it.
And so that's really the only take-home message that I have for you.
You can take paperwork, books, movies, and you can make it disappear -- it's magic.
Finally, we want multifunctional spaces and housewares -- a sink combined with a toilet, a dining table becomes a bed -- same space, a little side table stretches out to seat 10.
In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here, we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space.
We said, there's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics.
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint, sustainable from an economic standpoint as well.
Well a good place to start is with waste.
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics, not only by type, but by grade.
And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic: one type, one grade.
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material.

We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.
There has to be, between me and the orchestra, an unshakable bond of trust, born out of mutual respect, through which we can spin a musical narrative that we all believe in.
Now in the old days, conducting, music making, was less about trust and more, frankly, about coercion.
Up to and around about the Second World War, conductors were invariably dictators -- these tyrannical figures who would rehearse, not just the orchestra as a whole, but individuals within it, within an inch of their lives.
You overcompensate.
And in my game, that means you overgesticulate.
You end up like some kind of rabid windmill.
Bugger me, they wouldn't give it to me.
I spent a lot of time in those early years weeping silently in dressing rooms.
And how futile seemed the words of advice to me from great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis who said, "Conducting, Charles, is like holding a small bird in your hand.

One of them was "Carmen."
We then thought we'd make a movie of "Carmen," which we recorded and shot outside on location in the township outside Cape Town called Khayelitsha.
The piece was sung entirely in Xhosa, which is a beautifully musical language, if you don't know it.

It's called "U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha" -- literally "Carmen of Khayelitsha."
I want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about South African music making.
Or do I smell some doubt in the room?
Okay, we'll play it for you again now, and we're going to highlight, we're going to poke out the T, E, D.
If you'll pardon the expression.
My son is 23.
And at least until they're 23, we're still popping those worms into those little open mouths.
All right, why would we see this correlation?
If I showed you this detector, you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector.
But actually, this detector works in a bit of a strange way.
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector, something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with, the detector will actually activate two out of three times.
Boy: That's why.
Oh.
AG: Now this is his next idea.
So they're bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that's important.
That's the kind of attention, the kind of consciousness, that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn.
Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults, I think the best thing is think about cases where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before -- when we fall in love with someone new, or when we're in a new city for the first time.
But I felt something.
And it was a physiological response.
And from that point on, from my age at the time, I began to think of things in a different way.
This is one of the most beautiful things I know.
It's a plastic bag.
And when I looked at it first, I thought, no, there's no beauty in that.
And all of a sudden, this plastic bag was extremely beautiful to me.
Now I'm going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit.
Would you mind taking the brain out, and I just want you to feel something.
Or the information's added on at the back, like that little girl's drawing that I showed you.
Now when talking about beauty you can't get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you.
And one of the most tedious ones, I think, was saying that beauty was about symmetry.
But they're both different.
And as a designer, I can't help meddling with this, so I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this, and tried to understand what the individual elements were, but feeling it as I go.
Now I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if I look at that eye.
And this is the F1 MV Agusta.
Ahhhh.
It is really -- I mean, I can't express to you how exquisite this object is.
Ahhhh.
It is really -- I mean, I can't express to you how exquisite this object is.
But I also know why it's exquisite to me, because it's a palimpsest of things.
But I also know why it's exquisite to me, because it's a palimpsest of things.
It's masses and masses of layers.
This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension.
And I feel that here.
This bit, the big secret of automotive design -- reflection management.
It's not about the shapes, it's how the shapes reflect light.
Tell me something, did you think it was quick when you first saw it? Yes you did.
Did you think it was modern? Yes you did.
That blip, that information, shot into you before that.

And the great thing is, this motorcycle has been styled this way specifically to engender a sense that it's green technology and it's good for you and it's light and it's all part of the future.
So is that wrong?
But you're a slave of that first flash.
We are slaves to the first few fractions of a second -- and that's where much of my work has to win or lose, on a shelf in a shop.
It wins or loses at that point.
Form follows function?
Only sometimes. Only sometimes.
Form is function. Form is function.
And what Vannevar Bush was saying was the way we use information is broken.
We don't work in terms of libraries and catalog systems and so forth.
The brain works by association.
The brain works by association.
With one item in its thought, it snaps instantly to the next item.
And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process.
And he had a platform where you linked information to other information, and then you could call it up at will.
So spinning forward, one of the guys who read this article was a guy called Doug Engelbart, and he was a U.S. Air Force officer.
And he was reading it in their library in the Far East.
These are some examples of this system in action in the late 80s.
You were able to deliver documents, were able to do it over networks.
We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html.
Lying's complex.
It's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives.
We're deeply ambivalent about the truth.
We're deeply ambivalent about the truth.
We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives.

It's as old as breathing.
It's part of our culture, it's part of our history.
Think Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, News of the World.
Lying has evolutionary value to us as a species.
And if you ask someone honest what should happen to whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather than lenient punishment.
Now let's say you're having that exact same conversation with someone deceptive.
That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky.
Here's what it looks like.
It's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in.
It's the only asymmetrical expression.
They know, as someone once said, "Character's who you are in the dark."
And what's kind of interesting is that today, we have so little darkness.
Our world is lit up 24 hours a day.
But our current funeral practices make the situation much worse.
If you're cremated, all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere.
And this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year.
If you're cremated, all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere.
And this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year.
And in a traditional American funeral, a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive.
So today, I'm collecting what I shed or slough off -- my hair, skin and nails -- and I'm feeding these to edible mushrooms.
As the mushrooms grow, I pick the best feeders to become Infinity Mushrooms.
It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife.
Once it's completed, I plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects.
First, a burial suit infused with mushroom spores, the Mushroom Death Suit.
I'm wearing the second prototype of this burial suit.
What the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college."
So the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.
They said, "Please, don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college."
We like the light that comes into the room, but in the middle of summer, all that heat is coming into the room that we're trying to keep cool.
In winter, exactly the opposite is happening.
We're trying to heat up the space that we're in, and all that is trying to get out through the window.

We want to talk about storing energy, and unfortunately the best thing we've got going is something that was developed in France a hundred and fifty years ago, the lead acid battery.
In terms of dollars per what's stored, it's simply the best.
Knowing that we're not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power, we went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas, and we gave them this diagram.
We said, "Could you build this?"
And these scientists, instead of laughing at us, said, "Yeah."
And what they built was eBox.
We said, "Could you build this?"
And these scientists, instead of laughing at us, said, "Yeah."
And what they built was eBox.
EBox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside, hold it until you need it, and then be able to release it and pass it off.
Being able to do that means that I can generate energy cleanly, efficiently and cheaply right where I am.
It's my energy.
These also require tremendous amounts of energy.
In fact, it's going to require twice the world's supply of oil to run the pumps to generate the water.
We're simply not going to do that.
18 years ago, I saw a photograph in the paper.
It was taken by Kevin Carter who went to the Sudan to document their famine there.
I've carried this photograph with me every day since then.
And we still use them commonly, because they're very robust and relatively simple devices.
The state of the art is what we call myoelectric prostheses.
These are motorized devices that are controlled by little electrical signals from your muscle.
And I also have the hand closed and open.
TK: Thank you, Amanda.
Now this is a research arm, but it's made out of commercial components from here down and a few that I've borrowed from around the world.
She's carrying all the weight through harnesses.
So the exciting part isn't so much the mechatronics, but the control.
So we've developed a small microcomputer that is blinking somewhere behind her back and is operating this all by the way she trains it to use her individual muscle signals.

And that's where our goal is -- to have something clinically pragmatic to wear.
We've also had Amanda able to use some of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier.
Here's Amanda using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation.
I want you to watch closely.
Claudia: Oooooh!
TK: That's Claudia, and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic.
Every single bead, every single colored band, represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note.
I find weather extremely fascinating.
Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us.
I use these scores to collaborate with musicians.
This is the 1913 Trio performing one of my pieces at the Milwaukee Art Museum.
Meanwhile, I use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this, that function still in the sense of being a three-dimensional weather visualization, but now they're embedding the visual matrix of the musical score, so it can actually be read as a musical score.

It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted.
It comes from the World Values Survey.
You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others.
This is violence.
These red dots are American states, and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.
But look at the scale of the differences.
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150.
This is the proportion of the population in prison.
There's a about a tenfold difference there, log scale up the side.
I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality.
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, of being valued and devalued, respected and disrespected.
And of course, those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society.
And as Norden famously says, "Before that bombsight came along, bombs would routinely miss their target by a mile or more."
But he said, with the Mark 15 Norden bombsight, he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft.
Now I cannot tell you how incredibly excited the U.S. military was by the news of the Norden bombsight.
And what was God's will?
Well God's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible.
And what did the Norden bombsight do?
Well God's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war be reduced to as small an amount as possible.
And what did the Norden bombsight do?
Well it allowed you to do that.
So in the years leading up to the Second World War, the U.S. military buys 90,000 of these Norden bombsights at a cost of $14,000 each -- again, in 1940 dollars, that's a lot of money.
And they trained 50,000 bombardiers on how to use them -- long extensive, months-long training sessions -- because these things are essentially analog computers; they're not easy to use.
And they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath, to swear that if they're ever captured, they will not divulge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy, because it's imperative the enemy not get their hands on this absolutely essential piece of technology.

And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane, it's escorted there by a series of armed guards.
And it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it.
And the box is handcuffed to one of the guards.
It's never allowed to be photographed.
And there's a little incendiary device inside of it, so that, if the plane ever crashes, it will be destroyed and there's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it.
The Norden bombsight is the Holy Grail.
So what happens during the Second World War?
Well, it turns out it's not the Holy Grail.
In practice, the Norden bombsight can drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft., but that's under perfect conditions.
And of course, in wartime, conditions aren't perfect.
And of course, in wartime, conditions aren't perfect.
First of all, it's really hard to use -- really hard to use.
And not all of the people who are of those 50,000 men who are bombardiers have the ability to properly program an analog computer.

Or take the battle in Afghanistan.
What is the signature weapon of the CIA's war in Northwest Pakistan?
It's the drone. What is the drone?

Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.
to our patients.
And so, please consider this a work in progress, but I'd like to tell you today a story about a very rare cancer called midline carcinoma, about the undruggable protein target that causes this cancer, called BRD4, and about a molecule developed at my lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, which we affectionately named for Jun Qi, the chemist that made this molecule.
Now, BRD4 is an interesting protein.

When it winds up its genome, divides into two cells and unwinds again, why does it not turn into an eye, into a liver, as it has all the genes necessary to do this?
What this research taught us -- not just my lab, but our institute, and Harvard Medical School more generally -- is that we have unique resources in academia for drug discovery; that our center, which has tested perhaps more cancer molecules than any other, never made one of its own.
For all the reasons you see listed here, we think there's a great opportunity for academic centers to participate in this earliest, conceptually tricky and creative discipline of prototype drug discovery.
So what next?

We have this molecule, but it's not a pill yet.
So what next?
We have this molecule, but it's not a pill yet.
It's not orally bioavailable.
And so we seek, really, to download from the amazing successes of the computer-science industry, two principles -- that of open source and that of crowdsourcing -- to quickly, responsibly accelerate the delivery of targeted therapeutics to patients with cancer.
Now, the business model involves all of you.
This research is funded by the public.
And then I settled in New York where I became a tour guide.
And I still worked as a tour leader, traveled back and forth in China, Tibet and Central Asia.
So of course, it took time, and I was nearly 40, and I decided it's time to start as an artist.

I chose papercutting because paper is cheap, it's light, and you can use it in a lot of different ways.
So it's actually a papercut that's nine yards long.
So in life and in papercutting, everything is connected.
One story leads to another.
Here is a three-week papercutting marathon at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City.
The result is "Hells and Heavens."
It's two panels 13 ft. high.
The result is "Hells and Heavens."
It's two panels 13 ft. high.
They were installed in the museum on two floors, but in fact, it's a continuous image.

Well you have to take control over it.
And if I give you this information directly, it's a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces.
The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- and it doesn't matter who they are -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information, or restricted access to information.

The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- and it doesn't matter who they are -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information, or restricted access to information.
And the reason their information has any value is, well, because no one else has access to it.
And I understand that, on an individual level, it's purely symbolic.
But if 300 million people in the U.S.
started doing this, we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up.
Why are you posting these photos?"
This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere and 750 million people were posting status messages or poking people.
So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete.

But I wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral.
I want to know if there's a chemistry of morality.
I want to know if there was a moral molecule.
I want to know if there's a chemistry of morality.
I want to know if there was a moral molecule.
After 10 years of experiments, I found it.
After 10 years of experiments, I found it.
Would you like to see it? I brought some with me.
This little syringe contains the moral molecule.
I did what most of us do -- I tried it on some colleagues.
One of them told me, "Paul, that is the world's stupidist idea.
It is," he said, "only a female molecule.
Now this is the same Adam Smith who, 17 years later, would write a little book called "The Wealth of Nations" -- the founding document of economics.
But he was, in fact, a moral philosopher, and he was right on why we're moral.
I just found the molecule behind it.
But he was, in fact, a moral philosopher, and he was right on why we're moral.
I just found the molecule behind it.
But knowing that molecule is valuable, because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off.
I'm working at a gas station on the outskirts of Santa Barbara, California.
You sit in a gas station all day, you see lots of morality and immorality, let me tell you.
So one Sunday afternoon, a man walks into my cashier's booth with this beautiful jewelry box.
The flight testing that followed that was as basic and low-risk as we could make it, but it still accomplished what we needed to to take the program to the next step and to gain the credibility that we needed within our eventual market, the general aviation community, and with the regulators that govern the use of design of aircraft, particularly in the States.
The FAA, about a year ago, gave us an exemption for the Transition to allow us to have an additional 110 lbs.
within the light sport aircraft category.
And they're now fully capable of handling any of the loads you would see in flight -- just like putting down your convertible top.
And you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that.
Test Pilot: Until the vehicle flies, 75 percent of your risk is that first flight.
For those of you who aren't yet pilots, there's four main reasons why those of us who are don't fly as much as we'd like to: the weather, primarily, cost, long door-to-door travel time and mobility at your destination.
Now, bad weather comes in, just land, fold up the wings, drive home.
Doesn't matter if it rains a little, you have a windshield wiper.
If you pit Garry Kasparov here, when he's not in jail, against IBM's Deep Blue, well the answer is IBM's Deep Blue will occasionally win.
And I think if IBM's Deep Blue played anyone in this room, it would win every time.
That problem is solved.
Now a lot of robotics is very impressive, but manipulation robotics is really just in the dark ages.
So this is the end of a Ph.D. project from one of the best robotics institutes.
And the student has trained this robot to pour this water into a glass.
Now we can compare this to cutting-edge human performance.
So what I'm going to show you is Emily Fox winning the world record for cup stacking.
Now the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking.
The trouble is these signals are not the beautiful signals you want them to be.
So one thing that makes controlling movement difficult is, for example, sensory feedback is extremely noisy.
Now by noise, I do not mean sound.
We use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense meaning a random noise corrupting a signal.
So the old days before digital radio when you were tuning in your radio and you heard "crrcckkk" on the station you wanted to hear, that was the noise.
But more generally, this noise is something that corrupts the signal.
You accumulate knowledge throughout your life in memories.
And the point about Bayesian decision theory is it gives you the mathematics of the optimal way to combine your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence to generate new beliefs.
And I've put the formula up there.
And the point about Bayesian decision theory is it gives you the mathematics of the optimal way to combine your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence to generate new beliefs.
And I've put the formula up there.
I'm not going to explain what that formula is, but it's very beautiful.
And I've put the formula up there.
I'm not going to explain what that formula is, but it's very beautiful.
And it has real beauty and real explanatory power.
And it has real beauty and real explanatory power.
And what it really says, and what you want to estimate, is the probability of different beliefs given your sensory input.
So let me give you an intuitive example.
And what this part really says is I have to predict the probability of different sensory feedbacks given my beliefs.
So that really means I have to make predictions of the future.
And I want to convince you the brain does make predictions of the sensory feedback it's going to get.
But you can imagine looking inside the brain.
And here's inside the brain.
You might have a little predictor, a neural simulator, of the physics of your body and your senses.
You might have a little predictor, a neural simulator, of the physics of your body and your senses.
So as you send a movement command down, you tap a copy of that off and run it into your neural simulator to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions.
So as I shake this ketchup bottle, I get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row.
Imagine, as I shake the ketchup bottle, someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me.
Now I get an extra source of sensory information due to that external act.
So I get two sources.
Imagine, as I shake the ketchup bottle, someone very kindly comes up to me and taps it on the back for me.
Now I get an extra source of sensory information due to that external act.
So I get two sources.
What evidence is there for this?
Well there's one very clear example where a sensation generated by myself feels very different then if generated by another person.
And so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tickling.
And what we've measured is the force as a function of terms.
And if we look at what we start with, a quarter of a Newton there, a number of turns, perfect would be that red line.
And what we see in all pairs of subjects is this -- a 70 percent escalation in force on each go.
CA: So you think that people thinking about the brain, and consciousness generally, could get real insight by saying, where does movement play in this game?
DW: So people have found out for example that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision is a mistake.
You have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision.

You might think of this as kind of like a primitive cell. It is a simple chemical model of a living cell, and if you consider for example a cell in your body may have on the order of millions of different types of molecules that need to come together, play together in a complex network to produce something that we call alive.
In the laboratory what we want to do is much the same, but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules -- so a drastic reduction in complexity, but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike.
And so what we do is, we start simple and we work our way up to living systems.

And so what we do is, we start simple and we work our way up to living systems.
Consider for a moment this quote by Leduc, a hundred years ago, considering a kind of synthetic biology: "The synthesis of life, should it ever occur, will not be the sensational discovery which we usually associate with the idea."
So we came up with this protocell model here that I'm showing.
We started with a natural occurring clay called montmorillonite.
This is natural from the environment, this clay.
So just through self-assembly, mixing things together in the lab, we can come up with, say, a metabolic surface with some informational molecules attached inside of this membrane body, right?
So we're on a road towards living systems.
But if you saw this protocell, you would not confuse this with something that was actually alive.
So we came up with a different protocell model, and this is actually simpler than the previous one.
In this protocell model, it's just an oil droplet, but a chemical metabolism inside that allows this protocell to use energy to do something, to actually become dynamic, as we'll see here.
You add the droplet to the system.
In this protocell model, it's just an oil droplet, but a chemical metabolism inside that allows this protocell to use energy to do something, to actually become dynamic, as we'll see here.
You add the droplet to the system.
It's a pool of water, and the protocell starts moving itself around in the system.
It's a pool of water, and the protocell starts moving itself around in the system.
Okay? Oil droplet forms through self-assembly, has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy, and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment.
As we heard earlier, movement is very important in these kinds of living systems.
Okay? Oil droplet forms through self-assembly, has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy, and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment.
As we heard earlier, movement is very important in these kinds of living systems.
It is moving around, exploring its environment, and remodeling its environment, as you see, by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.
So it's acting, in a sense, like a living system trying to preserve itself.
We take this same moving protocell here, and we put it in another experiment, get it moving. Then I'm going to add some food to the system, and you'll see that in blue here, right?
So I add some food source to the system.
We take this same moving protocell here, and we put it in another experiment, get it moving. Then I'm going to add some food to the system, and you'll see that in blue here, right?
So I add some food source to the system.
The protocell moves. It encounters the food.
It reconfigures itself and actually then is able to climb to the highest concentration of food in that system and stop there.
Alright? So not only do we have this system that has a body, it has a metabolism, it can use energy, it moves around.
It can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself.
So this is a work called "The Sun Shadow."
And it was almost like a sheet of paper, like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun.
And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust, and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.
And it was almost like a sheet of paper, like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun.
And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust, and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.
So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it, thinking it was some crap laying around.

But as soon as they passed by, it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.
But as soon as they passed by, it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.
And it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.
So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man.
Because if that circle weren't there, and the floor was very even, it would start to wander about in the space.
And there's no wires.
So I'll just show you an instance -- so when people enter the room, it activates this object.
So I'll just show you an instance -- so when people enter the room, it activates this object.
And it very slowly, over a few minutes, sort of painfully goes up, and then it gains momentum and it looks like it's almost about to fall.
And this is an important moment, because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.
And this is an important moment, because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.
But it doesn't really need it, because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.
So this work was a real technical challenge for us, and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.
And this is an important moment, because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.

So this work was a real technical challenge for us, and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.
And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall, because if we made it in a way that it would topple over, then it would damage itself, and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism, or that sense of wanting to go and help it.
So I'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario -- it's much faster.
That's my colleague. He's let it go.
So I'm going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario -- it's much faster.

Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.
And the idea was that at some point you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space, and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.
So this is the last work, and a work in progress, and it's called "Space Filler."
Well imagine a small cube that's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room, and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.

So we work with a lot of technology, but we don't really love technology, because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.

I'd like to start with a short story.
They would always stop by to visit these huge winged bulls that used to guard the gates of that ancient metropolis, and the boy used to be scared of these winged bulls, but at the same time they excited him.
And the dad used to use those bulls to tell the boy stories about that civilization and their work.
Let's fast-forward to the San Francisco Bay Area many decades later, where I started a technology company that brought the world its first 3D laser scanning system.
A few days later, we received a call: "Is the data available and can it be used for reconstruction?"
Our answer, of course, was yes.
Let me leave you with a final thought.
Our answer, of course, was yes.
Let me leave you with a final thought.
Our heritage is much more than our collective memory -- it's our collective treasure.
We chart it, we've described it, we've drawn it, we've mapped it.
Now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology -- think Google Maps, think GPS -- the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation.
So let's take a look at the brain.
Now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology -- think Google Maps, think GPS -- the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation.
So let's take a look at the brain.
Most people, when they first look at a fresh human brain, they say, "It doesn't look what you're typically looking at when someone shows you a brain."
Scientists, sort of at the end of the 20th century, learned that they could track blood flow to map non-invasively where activity was going on in the human brain.
So for example, they can see in the back part of the brain, which is just turning around there.
There's the cerebellum; that's keeping you upright right now.
The brain is removed from the skull, and then it's sliced into one-centimeter slices.
And those are frozen solid, and they're shipped to Seattle.
And in Seattle, we take these -- this is a whole human hemisphere -- and we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer.
And those are frozen solid, and they're shipped to Seattle.

There's a blade here that's going to cut across a section of the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide.
So this is where experts come in and they make basic anatomic assignments.
You could consider this state boundaries, if you will, those pretty broad outlines.
From this, we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces, which then we can put on a smaller cryostat.
From this, we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces, which then we can put on a smaller cryostat.
And this is just showing this here -- this frozen tissue, and it's being cut.
This is 20 microns thin, so this is about a baby hair's width.
You can see on the microscope slide here, that's what's happening in real time.
There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue.
We take that tissue, we purify the RNA out of it using some basic technology, and then we put a florescent tag on it.
So here's the modalities that we put together.
You'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before.
Here's the MR. It provides the framework.
And I think that's sort of the point of Improv Everywhere.
It's that there is no point and that there doesn't have to be a point.
We don't need a reason.

So I was at my minimum altitude in that vector -- fast -- so I pulled that.
And then I did open my chute.
BG: So the wings have their own parachute, and you have your two parachutes.
My first app was a unique fortune teller called Earth Fortune that would display different colors of earth depending on what your fortune was.
My favorite and most successful app is Bustin Jieber, which is â  â which is a Justin Bieber Whac-A-Mole.
I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit, so I decided to make the app.
I'm fortunate enough to be part of one.
A big challenge is, how should the iPads be used, and what apps should we put on the iPads?
So we're getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they'd like.
But at that time, most of the mutant worms are still alive.
And it isn't until twice as long that they're all dead.
And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.
And it isn't until twice as long that they're all dead.
And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.
So the first thing you're going to see is the normal worm when it's about college student age -- a young adult.
It's quite a cute little fellow.
And next you're going to see the long-lived mutant when it's young.
So this animal is going to live twice as long.
You know, even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans -- which probably most of you haven't seen one -- you can tell they're old -- isn't that interesting?
So there's something about aging that's kind of universal.
And now here is the daf-2 mutant.
Well as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA, they're instructions to make a protein that does something.
And the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor.
So what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell.
I just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell, that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well; the animal lives longer.
So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging.
That's what that arrow means.
I just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell, that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well; the animal lives longer.
So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging.
That's what that arrow means.
And the way that they're switched on is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO.
So in a daf-2 mutant -- you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.
The receptor isn't working as well.
And the way that they're switched on is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO.
So in a daf-2 mutant -- you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.
The receptor isn't working as well.
The receptor isn't working as well.
Under those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue has gone into the nucleus -- that little compartment there in the middle of the cell -- and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.
You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.
You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.
And it's just sitting on one of them.
So FOXO turns on a lot of genes.
And it's just sitting on one of them.
So FOXO turns on a lot of genes.
And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes, genes I call carrot-giver genes, whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well -- to fold correctly and function correctly.
But what good is this for the worm?
Well we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions -- in the good times -- when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment.
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients.
And that's why we think the animals live longer.
So you can think of FOXO as being like a building superintendent.
So maybe he's a little bit lazy, but he's there, he's taking care of the building.
So he doesn't actually do anything himself.
He gets on the telephone -- just like FOXO gets on the DNA -- and he calls up the roofer, the window person, the painter, the floor person.
And they all come and they fortify the house.
He gets on the telephone -- just like FOXO gets on the DNA -- and he calls up the roofer, the window person, the painter, the floor person.
And they all come and they fortify the house.
And then the hurricane comes through, and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.
There's one called TOR, which is another nutrient sensor, like the insulin pathway.
And mutations that damage the TOR gene -- just like the daf-2 mutations -- extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice.
But in this case, there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the TOR protein and inhibits its activity.
Thank you.
Matt Ridley: Thank you, Cynthia.
Let me get this straight.
But if we want to look at the sky and see predictions, we still can.
We can see predictions of galaxies forming, of galaxies colliding into each other, of new solar systems.
This is a wonderful thing.
All you have to do is, when she walks in, using a quantum interpretation, say, "I'm so sorry.
I stopped observing the house for a moment, and when I started observing again, everything had happened."
That's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming.
I'm sitting on a train.
Every time I breathe in, I'm breathing in a million-billion-billion atoms of oxygen.
I'm sitting on a chair.
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks.
With a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way.
In a hospital, this device could be used to carry around medical equipment.
I would love to share with you a story.
Once upon a time in 19th century Germany, there was the book.
Now during this time, the book was the king of storytelling.
Once upon a time in 19th century Germany, there was the book.
Now during this time, the book was the king of storytelling.
It was venerable.

It was ubiquitous.
It would take me a month to shoot a four-minute roll of film, because that's all I could afford.
I've been shooting time-lapse flowers continuously, non-stop, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 30 years, and to see them move is a dance I'll never get tired of.
Their beauty immerses us with color, taste, touch.
Their beauty immerses us with color, taste, touch.
It also provides a third of the food we eat.
Beauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival, because we protect what we fall in love with.
Their beauty immerses us with color, taste, touch.
It also provides a third of the food we eat.
Beauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival, because we protect what we fall in love with.
And aren't we grateful that we have hearts that can feel these vibrations in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure and the beauty of nature?
Nature's beauty is a gift that cultivates appreciation and gratitude.
So I have a gift I want to share with you today, a project I'm working on called Happiness Revealed, and it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective from the point of view of a child and an elderly man Child: When I watch TV, it's just some shows that you just -- that are pretend, and when you explore, you get more imagination than you already had, and when you get more imagination,
Begin by opening your eyes and be surprised that you have eyes you can open, that incredible array of colors that is constantly offered to us for pure enjoyment.
Look at the sky.
We so rarely look at the sky.
I first started thinking about getting it in my mid-20s, but I deliberately waited a really long time.
Because we all know people who have gotten tattoos when they were 17 or 19 or 23 and regretted it by the time they were 30.
That didn't happen to me.
Because we all know people who have gotten tattoos when they were 17 or 19 or 23 and regretted it by the time they were 30.
That didn't happen to me.
I got my tattoo when I was 29, and I regretted it instantly.
It's also, by the way, a characteristic of certain kinds of brain damage.
So people who have damage to their orbital frontal cortex seem to be unable to feel regret in the face of even obviously very poor decisions.
So if, in fact, you want to live a life free of regret, there is an option open to you.
What is regret?
Regret is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happier if we had done something different in the past.
So in other words, regret requires two things.
Regret is the emotion we experience when we think that our present situation could be better or happier if we had done something different in the past.
So in other words, regret requires two things.
It requires, first of all, agency -- we had to make a decision in the first place.
We need to be able to imagine going back and making a different choice, and then we need to be able to kind of spool this imaginary record forward and imagine how things would be playing out in our present.
And in fact, the more we have of either of these things -- the more agency and the more imagination with respect to a given regret, the more acute that regret will be.
So let's say for instance that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic, and you finally arrive at your gate and you've missed your flight.
I mean, it's right up there with, "I want my mommy!"
We're not trying to solve the problem.
We're not trying to understand how the problem came about.
It connects the poles of our lives back together, the positive and the negative, and it sends a little current of life back into us.
The third way that I think we can help make our peace with regret is through the passage of time, which, as we know, heals all wounds -- except for tattoos, which are permanent.
So it's been several years since I got my own tattoo.
And do you guys just want to see it?
All right.
Actually, you know what, I should warn you, you're going to be disappointed.
Actually, you know what, I should warn you, you're going to be disappointed.
Because it's actually not that hideous.
I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face on some indiscreet part of myself or something.

I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face on some indiscreet part of myself or something.
When other people see my tattoo, for the most part they like how it looks.
When other people see my tattoo, for the most part they like how it looks.
It's just that I don't like how it looks.
And as I said earlier, I'm a perfectionist.
I got this tattoo because I spent most of my 20s living outside the country and traveling.
And when I came and settled in New York afterward, I was worried that I would forget some of the most important lessons that I learned during that time.
Specifically the two things I learned about myself that I most didn't want to forget was how important it felt to keep exploring and, simultaneously, how important it is to somehow keep an eye on your own true north.

And what I loved about this image of the compass was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image.
And what I loved about this image of the compass was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image.
And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device.
Well it did.
And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device.
Well it did.
But it turns out, it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would; it reminds me constantly of something else instead.
This idea came to me while talking to a physicist friend of mine at MIT.
He was struggling to explain something to me: a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter.
Now he confused me from the very start, because light doesn't cool things down.
The reason that you can see me standing here is because this room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons, and they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light.
All of them are different colors, they're rippling with different frequencies, and they're bouncing off every surface, including me, and some of those are flying directly into your eyes, and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here.
Now a laser is different.
All of them are different colors, they're rippling with different frequencies, and they're bouncing off every surface, including me, and some of those are flying directly into your eyes, and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here.
Now a laser is different.
It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized, and if you focus them into a beam, what you have is an incredibly useful tool.
First you trap atoms in a special bottle.
It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment.
And the atoms themselves are quite violent, but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency, an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down.
Little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero.
Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough, something truly bizarre happens.
It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas.
It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas.
It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid.
The atoms lose their individual identity, and the rules from the quantum world take over, and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties.
It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid.
The atoms lose their individual identity, and the rules from the quantum world take over, and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties.
For example, if you shine light through a superfluid, it is able to slow photons down to 60 kilometers per hour.
In fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all.
I remember thinking, my friend could have explained that entire experiment with a dance.
Of course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them.
The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research.
For example, at the University of Minnesota, there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde, and he works with dancers to study how cells move.
They do it by changing their shape.
And there's no way that you can't look at that as an overwhelming success.
It is. It's a huge success story in modern medicine.
However, despite this incredible facility that some cochlear implant users display with language, you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can't hear music almost at all.
In fact, most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so bad.
And so when it comes to this idea of restoring beauty to somebody's life, we have a long way to go when it comes to audition.
Now there are a lot of reasons for that.
When you say a word, what you care is that word was perceived correctly.
You don't care that the word sounded pretty when it was spoken.
Music is entirely different.
There's really very little point in listening to music when it doesn't sound good to you.
The acoustics of music are much harder than those of language.
And you can see on this figure, that the frequency range and the decibel range, the dynamic range of music is far more heterogeneous.
We would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users.
Go ahead and play this one.
Now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation.
We would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users.
Go ahead and play this one.
Now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation.
You would think that because these implants are optimized for speech, they were designed for speech.
But actually if you look at melody, what you find is that there's very little cortical activity in implant users compared with normal hearing controls.
So for whatever reason, this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices during melody perception.
Next thing you know, two guys in white appear, they give you the strange t-shirt, take you to the nearest mental institution.
So I would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be a very bad year for bad guys. And this phenomenon is called people power.
Well, people power has been there for a while.
So I would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be a very bad year for bad guys. And this phenomenon is called people power.
Well, people power has been there for a while.
It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India, it helped Martin Luther King win his historic racial struggle.
So, we pick tactics accommodated to the event, especially this thing we call the small tactics of dispersion.
They're very useful in violent oppression.
We are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used.
You have the enthusiasm higher, you see the fear is starting to melt.
Day two, you see people running towards the police instead of from the police, in Egypt.
You can tell that something is happening there.
And now, the picture of the smashed face on the barrel, with the policemen dragging it to the police car, that was the best day for newspaper photographers that they will ever have.
So, I mean, these are the things you can do.
And you can always use humor.
It is true that the Internet and the new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper.
They also make it a bit safer for the participants, because they give partial anonymity.
We're watching the great example of something else the Internet can do.
Okay, outstanding. So I invented that.
Or I was one of the people who did it.
That thing is called a CAPTCHA.
Amazon, now with the Kindle, is trying to digitize books.
Basically the way this works is you start with an old book.
You've seen those things, right? Like a book?
For example, for things that were written more than 50 years ago, the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words.
So what we're doing now is we're taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we're getting people to read them for us while they're typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet.
So the next time you type a CAPTCHA, these words that you're typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize.
So what we're doing now is we're taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we're getting people to read them for us while they're typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet.
So the next time you type a CAPTCHA, these words that you're typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize.
And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because, you see, one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book, it didn't know what it was, and it's going to present it to you.
But since it doesn't know the answer for it, it cannot grade it for you.
So what we do is we give you another word, one for which the system does know the answer.
We don't tell you which one's which, and we say, please type both.
And this is especially true because now we're giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other.
So funny things can happen.
For example, we presented this word.
So funny things can happen.
For example, we presented this word.
It's the word "Christians"; there's nothing wrong with it.
And it's not just because they're being forced to do so in school.
For example, in the United States alone, there are over five million people who have paid over $500 for software to learn a new language.
So people really, really want to learn a new language.
And as you translate them, and as you see how other people translate them, you start learning the language.
And as you get more and more advanced, we give you more and more complex sentences to translate.
But at all times, you're learning by doing.
First of all, people are really, really learning a language.
We're mostly done building it, and now we're testing it.
People really can learn a language with it.
People really can learn a language with it.
And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software.
So people really do learn a language.
So here's the thing: The current business model for language education is the student pays, and in particular, the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars.
That's the current business model.
The problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world's population doesn't have 500 dollars.
that we have today.
There are several features that all these silks have in common. They all have a common design, such as they're all very long -- they're sort of outlandishly long compared to other proteins.
They're very repetitive, and they're very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine.
So for example this would be one sentence, and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine, that repeats over and over and over again, and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule.
Silks made by the same spider can have dramatically different repeat sequences.
At the top of the screen, you're seeing the repeat unit from the dragline silk of a garden argiope spider.
So I've colored in the glycines again in green, alanine in red, and the serines, the letter S, in purple. And you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red, and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple.
What silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences, these amino acid sequences, to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers.
Now, it's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body.
On the other hand, if you were to look at strain -- this is how much a fiber can be extended -- if you look at the maximum value here, again, there's a lot of variation and the clear winner is flagelliform, or the capture spiral filament.
In fact, this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length.
So silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility.
In fact, this flagelliform fiber can actually stretch over twice its original length.
So silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility.
In the case of the capture spiral, it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey.
Yet, their draglines are not the toughest.
In fact, the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region, a non orb-web-weaving spider.
This is the dragline spun by scytodes, the spitting spider.
Everyone's listening. We're responding.
You have no time for projected ideas.
So the idea of a mistake: From the perspective of a jazz musician, it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake.
And we're going to play on this palette.
And at some point, Christian will introduce this note.
And we won't react to it.
And then this is a picture of one of the most famous hospitals in America.
This is Mass General in Boston.
And do you know where the operating room is?
That's so easy anybody could become a surgeon, right?
However, when we have a real patient on the table, this is the same neck dissection -- not so easy to tell the difference between different structures.
We heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society, what a pressing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute.
We do our best, based upon our training and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience, we say, you know what, the cancer's gone.
We've made a good job. We've taken it out.
That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient's on the table.
So here's an example of a nerve that has tumor surrounding it.
Can you tell where the tumor is?
I couldn't when I was working on this.
Can you tell where the tumor is?
I couldn't when I was working on this.
But here it is. It's fluorescent.
Now it's green.
See, so every single one in the audience now can tell where the cancer is.
We can tell in the operating room, in the field, at a molecular level, where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out.
We can tell in the operating room, in the field, at a molecular level, where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out.
And the cool thing about fluorescence is that it's not only bright, it actually can shine through tissue.
The light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue.
And I'm peeling that muscle away.
But even before I peel that muscle away, you saw that there was a tumor underneath.
So that's the beauty of having a tumor that's labeled with fluorescent molecules.
But when sentinel lymph node came into our treatment protocol, the surgeon basically looks for the single node that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer.
And then if that node has cancer, the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection.
So what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer, the woman would be saved from having unnecessary surgery.
So what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer, the woman would be saved from having unnecessary surgery.
But sentinel lymph node, the way that we do it today, is kind of like having a road map just to know where to go.
So if you're driving on the freeway and you want to know where's the next gas station, you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road.
This is important, because in China in 1997, the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society.
Just a year later the Yangtze flooded, causing something like 5,500 deaths.
So clearly there was a problem with deforestation.
So this dish in particular is basically champagne with seafood.
The champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes. A little bit of seafood and some crème fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish.  BR: But it's not all just edible pictures.
We decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar -- so in this case, we have carrot cake.

So we take a carrot cake, put it in a blender, and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice, and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream, I guess, and it comes off looking like, you know, Jupiter's floating around your plate.
So yeah, we're transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for.
This is made from three ingredients: beets, barley, corn, and so it actually cooks up like hamburger meat, looks and tastes like hamburger meat, and not only that, but it's basically removing the cow from the equation.
So replicating food, taking it into that next level is where we're going.
BR: And it's definitely the world's first bleeding veggie burger, which is a cool side effect.

It's a glycoprotein called miraculin, a naturally occurring thing. It still freaks me out every time I eat it, but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue, so that primarily sour taste receptors, so normally things that would taste very sour or tart, somehow begin to taste very sweet.

Let's just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that.
Let's just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that.
We could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas, and we can replace it with all-natural fresh fruit.
BR: So you see us here cutting up some watermelon. The idea with this is that we're going to eliminate tons of food miles, wasted energy, and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna, or any exotic produce or item from a very far-away place, with local, organic produce; so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin.

So after we do that, we put it into a vacuum bag, add a little bit of seaweed, some spices, and we roll it, and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna.
So the key now is to make it behave like tuna.
BR: And then after a quick dip into some liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear, we really have something that looks, tastes and behaves like the real thing.
HC: So the key thing to remember here is, we don't really care what this tuna really is.
What had happened is he ran a red light and hit me and my dog.
She ended up underneath the car.

Your aorta comes up behind your heart.
It's your major artery, and it was severed, so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth.

So eventually, the hospital decided it was time for me to go.
They needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could come back from whatever they were going through.
Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover.
And every time I approached the corner or the curb I would panic.
And the second one was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street.
So one of the seniors just came up to me, and she pushed me up to the corner and she said, "When you think it's time to go, just stick the cane out there.
They removed a hematoma from behind my eye.
The biggest change for me was that the world moved forward, that there were innovations and all kinds of new things -- cellphones, laptops, all these things that I had never seen before.
And as a blind person, your visual memory fades and is replaced with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell.

So much for the wonder, now for the mystery.
This is a mystery that has really been extremely hard to elucidate.
All the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience, this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation, has got major controversies.

And something else that happens is that those image-making regions where you have the plotting of all these neural maps, can then provide signals to this ocean of purple that you see around, which is the association cortex, where you can make records of what went on in those islands of image-making.
And the great beauty is that you can then go from memory, out of those association cortices, and produce back images in the very same regions that have perception.
So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the brain is.
So far the mystery of the conscious mind is diminishing a little bit because we have a general sense of how we make these images.
But what about the self?
The self is really the elusive problem.
Cetaceans and primates have also an autobiographical self to a certain degree.
And everybody's dogs at home have an autobiographical self to a certain degree.
But the novelty is here.
Do you remember the story of Odysseus and the Sirens from high school or junior high school?
There was this hero, Odysseus, who's heading back home after the Trojan War.
And he's standing on the deck of his ship, he's talking to his first mate, and he's saying, "Tomorrow, we will sail past those rocks, and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called Sirens.
But resisting temptation is hard.
The other reason that it's difficult to resist temptation is because it's an unequal battle between the present self and the future self.
I mean, let's face it, the present self is present.

It's in control. It's in power right now.
But despite my like for them, there's two nagging concerns that I've always had about commitment devices, and you might feel this if you use them yourself.
So the first is, when you've got one of these devices going, such as this contract to write everyday or pay, it's just a constant reminder that you have no self-control.
You're just telling yourself, "Without you, commitment device, I am nothing, I have no self-discipline."
And then when you're ever in a situation where you don't have a commitment device in place -- like, "Oh my God, that person's offering me a doughnut, and I have no defense mechanism," -- you just eat it.
So I don't like the way that they take the power away from you.
I think self-discipline is something, it's like a muscle.

I'm talking about the topic of saving.
Now saving is a classic two selves problem.
The present self does not want to save at all.
We provide the patients, the Afghan disabled, first with the physical rehabilitation then with the social reintegration.
It's a very logical plan, but it was not always like this.
For many years, we were just providing them with artificial limbs.
But many people today -- philosophers, artists, doctors, scientists -- are taking a new look at what I call the third act, the last three decades of life.
They realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life with its own significance -- as different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood.
And they are asking -- we should all be asking -- how do we use this time?
You realize, you're still yourself -- maybe even more so.
Picasso once said, "It takes a long time to become young."
I don't want to romanticize aging.
As I diminished, I grew.
As I lost so much, I finally started to find myself."
Neil Selinger, to me, is the embodiment of mounting the staircase in his third act.
And what is happening today is, in one sense, frightening because it's never happened before.
We have seen lateral shifts of power -- the power of Greece passed to Rome and the power shifts that occurred during the European civilizations -- but we are seeing something slightly different.
For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation.
It's also moving vertically.
What's happening today is that the power that was encased, held to accountability, held to the rule of law, within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.
The globalization of power -- we talk about the globalization of markets, but actually it's the globalization of real power.
My own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen, is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more U.N. institutions.
If we didn't have the U.N., we'd have to invent it.
The world needs an international forum.

Most of the others either never responded back, said they didn't have the time or didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me.
So it was a big commitment to drive to the lab to work multiple times.
However, it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab -- so I could finally start my project.

The first stage was completed at home, which consisted of marinating the chicken, grilling the chicken, amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab.
And then went on, my next summer, to work under Dr. Basu at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth, Texas.
And that is where the research began.
So ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people don't know about, or at least don't pay that much attention to.
But then on this side, with the same treatment, they're going up -- interesting.
But those are dots on a screen for you; what exactly does that mean?
Well basically that means that this protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell.
And ever since then, I've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff -- from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys.
But like I said, my journey wasn't just about the research, it was about finding my passion, and it was about making my own opportunities when I didn't even know what I was doing.
It was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing.
These chemical pollutants are currently not a criteria air pollutant, as defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act.
Which is surprising to me, because these chemical pollutants, through my research, I show that they had a very large negative impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients and thus should be regulated.
So today I want to show you my interactive software model that I created.
And if you're remodeling your house, take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring."
Because these solutions are natural, these solutions are sustainable, and these solutions are long-term investments -- long-term investments that we're making for our generation and for future generations.
Because these environmental solutions that Julie can make in her home, her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her.
And he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked.
Now South African friends will know that was very painful.
So what can we learn from all of this?
The good thing is that we are not powerless.
We have never had as many means of communication, means of being connected, means of reaching out, means of including.
The diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication.

Cholera was reported in Haiti for the first time in over 50 years last October.
There was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get.
It doesn't require any special training.
And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place, it uses light.
That means there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place, no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information.
Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill that won't accomplish its stated goals, but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects, you have to understand a little bit about the back story.
And the back story is this: SOPA and PIPA, as legislation, were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the 20th century.
The 20th century was a great time to be a media company, because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity.
What the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was, look, if people are taping stuff off the radio and then making mixtapes for their friends, that is not a crime. That's okay.
Taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay.
If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them, that's not okay.
And if you're not an American citizen, you can contact American citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same.
Because this seems like a national issue, but it is not.
These industries will not be content with breaking our Internet.
Now if everything else in the universe is like this, why are we different?
Why think of ourselves as somehow not just being a collection of all our parts, but somehow being a separate, permanent entity which has those parts?
Now this view is not particularly new, actually.
Why think of ourselves as somehow not just being a collection of all our parts, but somehow being a separate, permanent entity which has those parts?
Now this view is not particularly new, actually.
It has quite a long lineage.
So how does it work?
It typically reads CAD data, which is a product design data created on professional product design programs.
And here you can see an engineer -- it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer -- create a product in 3D.
And this material that's deposited either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form.
And the bonding process can happen by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting.
In this case, we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS.
So really the resolution is quite incredible.
The detail that you can get today is quite amazing.
So who's using it?
You can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques even if you tried to do it manually.
It's more efficient because we can now create all these cavities within the object that cool fluid.
And it's used by aerospace and automotive.
It's a lighter part and it uses less material waste.
So it's overall performance and efficiency just exceeds standard mass produced products.
And then taking this idea of creating a very detailed structure, we can apply it to honeycomb structures and use them within implants.
With 3D printing, we're seeing today that we can create much better implants.
And in fact, because we can create bespoke products en masse, one-offs, we can create implants that are specific to individuals.
So as you can see, this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic.
You can buy a machine today for about $300 that you can create yourself, which is quite incredible.
But then it begs the question, why don't we all have one in our home?
Because, simply, most of us here today don't know how to create the data that a 3D printer reads.

These are parts of a RepRap machine, which is a kind of desktop printer.
But what interests my company the most is the fact that you can create individual unique products en masse.
There's no need to do a run of thousands of millions or send that product to be injection molded in China.
It's really only a successful escape.
Think of the term we use, "Retreat."
This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle.
And the more focused my brain is, the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy.
Ordinarily, I would have no way of knowing how focused or relaxed I was in any tangible way.
As we know, our feelings about how we're feeling are notoriously unreliable.
In that headset you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear.
In the original Zen Bound game, you play it by scrolling your fingers over the pad.
In the game that we created, of course, you control the wooden form that's on the screen there with your mind.
I like to call this "intra-active."
Normally we think about technology as interactive.
This technology is intra-active.
It understands what's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information to move you forward.
So you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop.
At InteraXon, intra-active technology is one of our really defining mandates.
You can tag pictures of baby animals as happy, or whatever baby animals are to you, and then you can search that database, navigating with your feelings, rather than the keywords that just hint at them.
Or you could tag Facebook photos with the emotions that you had associated with those memories and then instantly prioritize the streams that catch your attention, just like this.
Humanizing technology is about taking what's already natural about the human-tech experience and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it.
And she was just the start.
I met women running essential oils businesses, wineries and even the country's largest advertising agency.
So these stories together became the Herald Tribune business cover.
It may even feel scary.

Let us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness.
They meant to rule by means of repression.
Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans.
Only brute force remained.

It was our last resort.
In his latest book, Harvard professor Steven Pinker -- and many other thinkers before him -- concludes that one of the main drivers behind less violent societies is the spread of the constitutional state and the introduction, on a large scale, of the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence -- legitimized by a democratically elected government, legitimized by checks and balances and an independent judicial system.
In other words, a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control.
Such a state monopoly on violence, first of all, serves as a reassurance.
That's why you're all in your chairs.
And that's why we have to use our muscle energy to stand up, to walk around and to lift things.
In cancer, cells rapidly divide and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth.
And this is exactly how one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells, two cancer cells become four cancer cells, and we have ultimately uncontrolled tumor growth.
Tumor Treating Fields use externally placed transducers attached to a field generator to create an artificial electric field on that space station.
And when that cellular space station is within the electric field, it acts on those highly charged proteins and aligns them.
These are Robert's MRIs, again, under only TTField treatment.
This is a therapy that takes time to work.

But what we can see is, by month six, the tumor has responded and it's begun to melt away.
We had stumbled across something called positive psychology, which is the reason I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning.
When I started talking about this research outside of academia, with companies and schools, the first thing they said to never do is to start with a graph.
The first thing I want to do is start with a graph.
And actually, it's the model that we expect to work in these environments.
Here we have a scene that you would find in any operating room across the U.S. or any other developed country.
In the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine.
And this machine is able to enable surgery and save lives because it was designed with this environment in mind.
In order to operate, this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer.
It needs an extremely well-trained anesthesiologist with years of training with complex machines to help her monitor the flows of the gas and keep her patients safe and anesthetized throughout the surgery.

It's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms, and it needs special care, TLC, to keep it up and running, and it's going to break pretty easily.

Essentially, to deliver anesthesia, you want as pure oxygen as possible, because eventually you're going to dilute it essentially with the gas.
And the mixture that the patient inhales needs to be at least a certain percentage oxygen or else it can become dangerous.
But so in here when there's electricity, the oxygen concentrator takes in room air.
And the mixture that the patient inhales needs to be at least a certain percentage oxygen or else it can become dangerous.
But so in here when there's electricity, the oxygen concentrator takes in room air.
Now we know room air is gloriously free, it is abundant, and it's already 21 percent oxygen.
But so in here when there's electricity, the oxygen concentrator takes in room air.
Now we know room air is gloriously free, it is abundant, and it's already 21 percent oxygen.
So all this concentrator does is take that room air in, filter it and send 95 percent pure oxygen up and across here where it mixes with the anesthetic agent.
Now we know room air is gloriously free, it is abundant, and it's already 21 percent oxygen.
So all this concentrator does is take that room air in, filter it and send 95 percent pure oxygen up and across here where it mixes with the anesthetic agent.
Now before that mixture hits the patient's lungs, it's going to pass by here -- you can't see it, but there's an oxygen sensor here -- that's going to read out on this screen the percentage of oxygen being delivered.
I shudder to say simple; it's straightforward.
And it's by design.
And you do not need to be a highly trained, specialized anesthesiologist to use this machine, which is good because, in these rural district hospitals, you're not going to get that level of training.

And so it's not going to break very easily, but if it does, virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a hex wrench and a screwdriver.
And so it's not going to break very easily, but if it does, virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a hex wrench and a screwdriver.
And finally, it's affordable.
This machine comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that I showed you earlier.
So to do that we've launched a number of partnerships with NGOs and universities to gather data on the user interface, on the types of surgeries it's appropriate for and ways we can enhance the device itself.
One of those partnerships is with Johns Hopkins just here in Baltimore.
They have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore.
So we're taking this machine and recreating some of the operating theater crises that this machine might face in one of the hospitals that it's intended for, and in a contained, safe environment, evaluating its effectiveness.
We're then able to compare the results from that study with real world experience, because we're putting two of these in hospitals that Johns Hopkins works with in Sierra Leone, including the hospital where that emergency C-section happened.
So I've talked a lot about anesthesia, and I tend to do that.

I think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health.
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells, which are very densely interconnected.
And scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food.
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here.
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here.
And when it fires a little spike of electricity, there's going to be a red dot and a click.
So what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.
And indeed, on the inputs to the hippocampus, cells are found which project into the hippocampus, which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it's exploring around.
So the cell on the left, you can see, it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east, whether it's the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table, which the animals are running around.
And the cell on the right there fires whenever there's a boundary to the south, whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.
And if you record from several grid cells -- shown here in different colors -- each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment, and each cell's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells.
So the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one.
So together, it's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment -- a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map, but using triangles.
Do people have grid cells?
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry, the same orientations of grid, shown in orange here, it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between.
So we can put people in an MRI scanner and have them do a little video game like the one I showed you and look for this signal.
Now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire.
And he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car.
And that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car's actually there.

So I actually started to investigate some of those issues and have a look at the way that police use non-lethal weapons when they're introduced and some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them.
And of course, being Australian, I started looking at stuff in Australia, knowing, again, from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia.
So one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of O.C. spray, oleoresin capsicum spray, pepper spray, by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced, what had happened and those sorts of issues.
And the Russian special military police, special forces, Spetsnaz, came in and actually stormed the theater.
And the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anesthetic gas.
And it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas.
So when they had a look at it afterward, there were only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation.
Virtually everybody that got killed got killed from inhaling the gas.
The final toll of hostages is a little unclear, but it's certainly a few more than that, because there were other people who died over the next few days.



Is it because it's a soft option; we have nothing else to do?
No, I don't think so.
I think that women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally.
Boy: Hey listen! Did you know that the stocks are up?
Who are you playing?
Girl: Uncle Khaled. Here, put on the headscarf.
And you all know that if you are going to determine whether you're related to your brother or your sister, you can't do it by looking at differences.
You can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities.
So people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are.
So it is going to get bigger.
If you cut open Stygimoloch, it is doing the same thing.
The dome, that little dome, is growing really fast.
It's a big skull.
But there's another dinosaur that is found in this formation that looks like a Triceratops, except it's bigger, and it's called Torosaurus.
And Torosaurus, when we cut into it, has mature bone.
And Torosaurus, when we cut into it, has mature bone.
But it's got these big holes in its shield.
And everybody says, "A Triceratops and a Torosaurus can't possibly be the same animal because one of them's bigger than the other one."
And I've come to realize that we have made leadership into something bigger than us; something beyond us.
We've made it about changing the world.
We've taken this title of "leader" and treat it as something that one day we're going to deserve.
If you think you haven't, think of all the hands that didn't go up when I asked.
You're just one of the people who hasn't been told.
It's scary to think of ourselves as that powerful, frightening to think we can matter that much to other people.

Penelope Jagessar Chaffer: I was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house.
No, I'm just joking.
Now if I told the men in this village that the frogs have pour immune function and eggs developing in their testes, the connection between environmental health and public health would be clear.
You would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact on the wildlife that lived in it.
The problem is, in my village, Oakland, in most of our villages, we don't see that connection.
Probably the best documented basking shark fishery in the world is that from Achill Island.
This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island.
And sharks used to come into the bay.
This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island.
And sharks used to come into the bay.
And the fishermen would tie a net off the headland, string it out along the other net.
And the fishermen would tie a net off the headland, string it out along the other net.
And as the shark came round, it would hit the net, the net would collapse on it.
It would often drown and suffocate.
And this is the only way to really work out the behavior and the movements when they're under water.
And here's a couple of maps that we've done.
That one, you can see that we tagged both off Kerry.
And here's a couple of maps that we've done.

And basically it spent all its time, the last eight months, in Irish waters.
So if you look at all those studies I showed you, the total number of samples worldwide is 86 at present.
So it's very important work, and they can ask some really good questions, and they can tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure, but they're constrained by lack of samples.
Now when we were out tagging our sharks, this is how we tagged them on the front of a RIB -- get in there fast -- occasionally the sharks do react.
And on one occasion when we were up in Malin Head up in Donegal, a shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail, more, I think, in startle to the fact that a boat came near it, rather than the tag going in.
And that was fine. We got wet. No problem.
And then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head, to the pier, I noticed some black slime on the front of the boat.
So when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat, I thought, "If you take what you're given in this world ..."
So I scraped it off.
And I had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists.
You can only rarely be in the right place to find sharks into August.
So we were desperate.
So we rushed out to Blasket as soon as we heard there were sharks there and managed to find some sharks.
Some 74 percent of people received the data.
Those who were intended to receive the data, 74 percent of them received it.
96 percent of them found it useful.
83 percent of them took action -- evidence that it is indeed empowering.
And 73 percent of them shared it.
The TERA system was developed from Haiti with support of engineers in the region.
And if people are migrating into urban, unfamiliar, concrete environments, they can also be helped in anticipation with social supporters ready and waiting for them based on SMS knowledge.
In Nigeria, open-source SMS tools are being used by the Red Cross community workers to gather information from the local community in an attempt to better understand and mitigate the prevalence of malaria.
My colleague, Jason Peat, who runs this program, tells me it's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things.
In the North, the boreal is bordered by the tundra, and just below that, in Yukon, we have this incredible valley, the Tombstone Valley.
And the Tombstone Valley is home to the Porcupine caribou herd.
Now you've probably heard about the Porcupine caribou herd in the context of its breeding ground in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
The other method of extraction is what's called the in-situ.
And here, massive amounts of water are super-heated and pumped through the ground, through these vasts networks of pipelines, seismic lines, drill paths, compressor stations.
And even though this looks maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines, it's even more damaging in some ways.
It impacts and fragments a larger part of the wilderness, where there is 90 percent reduction of key species, like woodland caribou and grizzly bears, and it consumes even more energy, more water, and produces at least as much greenhouse gas.
So these in-situ developments are at least as ecologically damaging as the mines.
The oil produced from either method produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other oil.
So these in-situ developments are at least as ecologically damaging as the mines.
The oil produced from either method produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other oil.
This is one of the reasons why it's called the world's dirtiest oil.
The incredibly high price of flying food into these remote Northern Aboriginal communities and the high rate of unemployment makes this an absolute necessity for survival.
And not that many years ago, I was lent a boat by a First Nations man.
And he said, "When you go out on the river, do not under any circumstances eat the fish.
The boreal forest sequesters more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem.
And this is absolutely key.
So what we're doing is, we're taking the most concentrated greenhouse gas sink, twice as much greenhouse gases are sequestered in the boreal per acre than the tropical rainforests.
Because what we do here is going to change our history, it's going to color our possibility to survive, and for our children to survive and have a rich future.
We have an incredible gift in the boreal, an incredible opportunity to preserve our best defense against global warming, but we could let that slip away.
The tar sands could threaten not just a large section of the boreal.
It's made of clay, and it's been fashioned into a cylinder shape, covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun.
And as you can see, it's been knocked about a bit, which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879.
But today, this thing is, I believe, a major player in the politics of the Middle East.
The empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians, united under Cyrus, became the first great world empire.
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC.
And by the time of his son Darius, the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control.
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC.
And by the time of his son Darius, the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control.
This empire is, in fact, the Middle East as we now know it, and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.
And by the time of his son Darius, the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control.
This empire is, in fact, the Middle East as we now know it, and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.
It was the largest empire the world had known until then.
This empire is, in fact, the Middle East as we now know it, and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.
It was the largest empire the world had known until then.
Much more important, it was the first multicultural, multifaith state on a huge scale.
Because interestingly, of course, Cyrus is a good Iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts.
That's 1879.
40 years on and we're in 1917, and the cylinder enters a different world.
It's the only object they want.
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder.
And last year, the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time.
It's a debate that's still continuing, and it will continue to rumble, because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration.
It stands with the American constitution.
It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta.
A replica of this is at the United Nations.
In New York this autumn, it will be present when the great debates about the future of the Middle East take place.
And I want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures.
Now I was a comparative literature major in college, which is like an English major, only instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months, we got to read great literature in translation from around the world.
And as great as these books were, that you were getting close to the full effect.
But not so with Márquez who once praised his translator's versions as being better than his own, which is an astonishing compliment.
And as great as these books were, that you were getting close to the full effect.
But not so with Márquez who once praised his translator's versions as being better than his own, which is an astonishing compliment.
So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa, had written his own book on the subject, I couldn't wait to read it.
It's called apropos of the Italian adage that I lifted from his forward, "If This Be Treason."
And it's a charming read.
It's highly recommended for anyone who's interested in the translator's art.
Finally, after about 10 years of alienating friends and strangers alike, I finally got it, a new personal truth all my own, that if I was going to ever communicate well with other people the ideas that I was gaining, I'd better find a different way of going about it.
And that's when I discovered comedy.
Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language.

And that's when I discovered comedy.
Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language.
If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum, I'd say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies.
And I'm not talking about all comedy here, because, clearly, there's plenty of humor that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel.
What I want to talk about is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has at circumventing our ingrained perspectives -- comedy as the philosopher's stone.
That it's about communication that doesn't just produce greater understanding within the individual, but leads to real change.
Which in my experience means communication that manages to speak to and expand our concept of self-interest.
Now I'm big on speaking to people's self-interest because we're all wired for that.
His intent is to be funny.
It just so happens that Stewart's brand of funny doesn't work unless the facts are true.
And the result is great comedy that's also an information delivery system that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention than the professional news media.
Why is this remotely controversial?
If you have a baby and you think that baby's gay, you should be allowed to put it up for adoption.
You have given birth to an abomination.
Bill Hicks -- and if you don't know his work, you should really Google him -- Hicks had a routine about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground, where finally the other kid says to him, "Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad," to which Hicks replies, "Really? How soon?"
That's an entire childhood in three words.
Not to mention what it reveals about the adult who's speaking them.
How about that? How about we create a better world for nothing?
Not for God, not for country, not for profit -- just as a basic metric for global decision-making.
And this cartoon hit the bull's eye.

Shortly after the conference was over, Joel got a request for a signed copy from the head of the EPA in Washington whose wall it now hangs on.
And we're going to look at their saving behavior.
First thing to notice is, half of them do not even have access to a 401 plan.
They cannot make savings easy.
If people have to check a lot of boxes to join a 401 plan, they're going to keep procrastinating and not join.
And last, we talked about loss aversion, and the monkeys and the apples.
If people frame mentally saving for retirement as a loss, they're not going to be saving for retirement.
Save More Tomorrow invites employees to save more maybe next year -- sometime in the future when we can imagine ourselves eating bananas, volunteering more in the community, exercising more and doing all the right things on the planet.
Now we also talked about checking the box and the difficulty of taking action.
Save More Tomorrow makes it easy.
One, two, three, four.
Less than three percent of a very sophisticated audience.
Behavioral finance has a long way.
This type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface than all other habitats combined.
And yet, we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars than we do about this habitat, despite the fact that we have yet to extract a gram of food, a breath of oxygen or a drop of water from those bodies.
And so 10 years ago, an international program began called the Census of Marine Life, which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans.

It involved 17 different projects around the world.
As you can see, these are the footprints of the different projects.
So it's not all hopeless.
But for the most part, we've gone from salting to exhausting.
Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one.
Now this guy, this bigfin squid, is seven meters in length.
But to be fair, it lives in the deep waters of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, so it was a lot harder to find.
But there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things.
Now this guy, this bigfin squid, is seven meters in length.
But to be fair, it lives in the deep waters of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, so it was a lot harder to find.
But there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things.
We don't know why they converge there, we simply don't know.
That's a question for the future.
One of the things that we're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive.
That's a question for the future.
One of the things that we're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive.
Now this little critter, it's only about half a millimeter in size, not terribly charismatic.
One of the things that we're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive.
Now this little critter, it's only about half a millimeter in size, not terribly charismatic.
But it was only discovered in the early 1980s.
So that's really exciting. What are they all doing out there?
We actually don't know.
The most exciting thing, I would say, about this census is the role of global science.
But of course, you can't borrow natural resources, so we're burning through our capital, or stealing from the future.
So when I say full, I mean really full -- well past any margin for error, well past any dispute about methodology.
What this means is our economy is unsustainable.
But that's not possible, you might think.
We can't stop economic growth.
Because that's what will stop: economic growth.
We can't stop economic growth.
Because that's what will stop: economic growth.
It will stop because of the end of trade resources.
It will stop because of the end of trade resources.
It will stop because of the growing demand of us on all the resources, all the capacity, all the systems of the Earth, which is now having economic damage.
When we think about economic growth stopping, we go, "That's not possible," because economic growth is so essential to our society that is is rarely questioned.

Although growth has certainly delivered many benefits, it is an idea so essential that we tend not to understand the possibility of it not being around.
Although growth has certainly delivered many benefits, it is an idea so essential that we tend not to understand the possibility of it not being around.
Even though it has delivered many benefits, it is based on a crazy idea -- the crazy idea being that we can have infinite growth on a finite planet.
And I'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes.
China plans to be there in just 20 years.
The only problem with this plan is that it's not possible.
In response, some people argue, but we need growth, we need it to solve poverty.
The only problem with this plan is that it's not possible.
In response, some people argue, but we need growth, we need it to solve poverty.
We need it to develop technology.
And that's why the end of growth is the central issue and the event that we need to get ready for.
So when does this transition begin?
When does this breakdown begin?
When does this breakdown begin?
In my view, it is well underway.
I know most people don't see it that way.
So it has four rotors.
If you spin these rotors at the same speed, the robot hovers.
If you increase the speed of each of these rotors, then the robot flies up, it accelerates up.
If you spin these rotors at the same speed, the robot hovers.
If you increase the speed of each of these rotors, then the robot flies up, it accelerates up.
Of course, if the robot were tilted, inclined to the horizontal, then it would accelerate in this direction.
Multiple flips, a little more time.
So here the processes on board are getting feedback from accelerometers and gyros on board, and calculating, like I said before, commands at 600 times a second, to stabilize this robot.
So on the left, you see Daniel throwing this robot up into the air, and it shows you how robust the control is.
So to remind you of physics: You have position, derivative, velocity; then acceleration; and then comes jerk, and then comes snap.
So this robot minimizes snap.
So what that effectively does, is produce a smooth and graceful motion.
And in the first video, you'll see the robot going from point A to point B, through an intermediate point.
So the robot is obviously capable of executing any curve trajectory.
So these are circular trajectories, where the robot pulls about two G's.
And the obstacles can be moving.
And here, you'll see Daniel throw this hoop into the air, while the robot is calculating the position of the hoop, and trying to figure out how to best go through the hoop.
So as an academic, we're always trained to be able to jump through hoops and we get our robots to do that.
So as an academic, we're always trained to be able to jump through hoops and we get our robots to do that.
So another thing the robot can do is it remembers pieces of trajectory that it learns or is pre-programmed.
So here, you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum, and then changes its orientation and then recovers.
So here, you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum, and then changes its orientation and then recovers.
So it has to do this because this gap in the window is only slightly larger than the width of the robot.
So just like a diver stands on a springboard and then jumps off it to gain momentum, and then does this pirouette, this two and a half somersault through and then gracefully recovers, this robot is basically doing that.
This is work done by Quentin Lindsey, who's a graduate student.
So his algorithm essentially tells these robots how to autonomously build cubic structures from truss-like elements.
So his algorithm tells the robot what part to pick up, when, and where to place it.
So what happens when you leave your lab, and you go outside into the real world?
And what if there's no GPS?
So this robot is actually equipped with a camera, and a laser rangefinder, laser scanner.
And it uses these sensors to build a map of the environment.
What that map consists of are features -- like doorways, windows, people, furniture -- and it then figures out where its position is, with respect to the features.
So there is no global coordinate system.
What that map consists of are features -- like doorways, windows, people, furniture -- and it then figures out where its position is, with respect to the features.
So there is no global coordinate system.
The coordinate system is defined based on the robot, where it is and what it's looking at.
The coordinate system is defined based on the robot, where it is and what it's looking at.
And it navigates with respect to those features.
So I want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by Frank Shen and Professor Nathan Michael, that shows this robot entering a building for the very first time, and creating this map on the fly.
So this robot is actually being commanded remotely by Frank, but the robot can also figure out where to go on its own.
So suppose I were to send this into a building, and I had no idea what this building looked like.
I can ask this robot to go in, create a map, and then come back and tell me what the building looks like.
So suppose I were to send this into a building, and I had no idea what this building looked like.
I can ask this robot to go in, create a map, and then come back and tell me what the building looks like.
So here, the robot is not only solving the problem of how to go from point A to point B in this map, but it's figuring out what the best point B is at every time.
But we're in Southern California, close to Los Angeles, so I have to conclude with something focused on entertainment.
I want to conclude with a music video.
I want to introduce the creators, Alex and Daniel, who created this video.
You don't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded by being like the rest of us, huh?
Come, let's go inside.
AS: What this scene is doing, and it did in the book, is it's fundamentally making a promise.
The elements you provide and the order you place them in is crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience.
Editors and screenwriters have known this all along.
It's the invisible application that holds our attention to story.
AS: I walked out of there wide-eyed with wonder.
And that's what I think the magic ingredient is, the secret sauce, is can you invoke wonder.
Wonder is honest, it's completely innocent.
The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate, and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet.
And the land, to depths of tens of meters, is also warming.
The total energy imbalance now is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter.
And the land, to depths of tens of meters, is also warming.

That may not sound like much, but when added up over the whole world, it's enormous.

It's about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity.
Jake is a super-positive, enthusiastic boy.
Here at age two and a half years, he thinks he can protect his two and a half-day-old little sister.
It would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control.
So people looking for good jobs are going to fail.
I want to talk about those looking for great jobs, great careers, and why you're going to fail.
First reason is that no matter how many times people tell you, "If you want a great career, you have to pursue your passion, you have to pursue your dreams, you have to pursue the greatest fascination in your life," you hear it again and again, and then you decide not to do it.
And what are you going to say?
You know what you're going to say?
"Look kid. I had a dream once, too, but -- So how are you going to finish the sentence with your "but"?
Now it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor.
So here's the metaphor I'm offering today.
Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms, most of which we're very familiar with.
Individuals unite into a team, a movement or a nation, which is far more than the sum of its parts.
Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group, into a moral community.
Durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness.
I'm saying we are Homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred.
When we climb that staircase, self-interest fades away, we become just much less self-interested, and we feel as though we are better, nobler and somehow uplifted.
So here's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me: Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design?
When we climb that staircase, self-interest fades away, we become just much less self-interested, and we feel as though we are better, nobler and somehow uplifted.
So here's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me: Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design?
Is it a product of natural selection, like our hands?
And after all, how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves?
How could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self-interest?
Well let me show you.
And after all, how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves?

Well let me show you.
He said, "If the one tribe included a great number of courageous, sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other, this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other."
He went on to say that "Selfish and contentious people will not cohere, and without coherence nothing can be effected."
In other words, Charles Darwin believed in group selection.
We start with just one green, and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food.
And in short order, the cooperators are done for.
The free-riders have taken over.
The free-riders have taken over.
If a group cannot solve the free-rider problem then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection cannot get started.
But there are solutions to the free-rider problem.
If a group cannot solve the free-rider problem then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection cannot get started.
But there are solutions to the free-rider problem.
It's not that hard a problem.
It's because they used to be separate free-living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism.
Somehow or other -- maybe one swallowed another; we'll never know exactly why -- but once they got a membrane around them, they were all in the same membrane, now all the wealth-created division of labor, all the greatness created by cooperation, stays locked inside the membrane and we've got a superorganism.
And now let's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters and look what happens.

And now let's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters and look what happens.
A superorganism can basically take what it wants.
The staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred, or deeply interconnected.
We are Homo duplex, as Durkheim explained.
And we are Homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection, as Darwin explained.
We are Homo duplex, as Durkheim explained.
And we are Homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection, as Darwin explained.
I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug, but if it is an adaptation, then the implications are profound.
Politics is partly profane, it's partly about self-interest, but politics is also about sacredness.
It's about joining with others to pursue moral ideas.
It's about the eternal struggle between good and evil, and we all believe we're on the good team.
And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate.
I'd therefore like to propose that we employ, we enlist, the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject.
For instance, just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft.
Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit.
It's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated.
Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law.
And I'm thinking to myself, "Brené, what are you doing?
Why did you bring this up?
Your sisters would be perfect for this."
Now let me ask you this question: This past week at TED, how many of you, when you saw vulnerability up here, thought it was pure courage?
Vulnerability is not weakness.
I define vulnerability as emotional risk, exposure, uncertainty.
And if we can quiet it down and walk in and say, "I'm going to do this," we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing, 99 percent of the time is who?
Us.
Shame drives two big tapes -- "never good enough" -- and, if you can talk it out of that one, "who do you think you are?"
Guilt, inversely correlated with those things.
The ability to hold something we've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive.
It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.
We're pretty sure that the only people who don't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy.
Which means, yes, I have a little shame; no, I'm a sociopath.
So I would opt for, yes, you have a little shame.
"I can put the wash on the line, pack the lunches, hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine.
I can bring home the bacon, fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you're a man."
For women, shame is, do it all, do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat.
You show me a man who can sit with a woman who's just had it, she can't do it all anymore, and his first response is not, "I unloaded the dishwasher!"
But he really listens -- because that's all we need -- I'll show you a guy who's done a lot of work.
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.

The top answers in this country: nice, thin, modest and use all available resources for appearance.
When he asked about men, what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms, the answers were: always show emotional control, work is first, pursue status and violence.
If we're going to find our way back to each other, we have to understand and know empathy, because empathy's the antidote to shame.

If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence and judgment.

So where are we headed from here?
We're headed to natural gas.
Natural gas will do everything we want it to do.

Run it through the separator and you're ready to use it.
You're going to find, and I'll tell you in just a minute, what you're looking for to make it happen.
But here you can look at the list.
Natural gas will fit all of those.
No, what happened to us, Chris, is that power, it's priced off the margin.
And so the margin is natural gas.
And at the time I went into the wind business, natural gas was nine dollars.
But no, I'm not. I own stocks.
But I also am in the fueling business.
CA: But natural gas is a fossil fuel.
Why doesn't that prospect concern you?
TBP: Well you're going to have to use something.
What do you have to replace it?
And so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas.
But if that's it and that becomes the reason that renewables don't get invested in, then, long-term, we're screwed anyway, right?
TBP: Well I'm not ready to give up, but Jim and I talked there as he left, and I said, "How do you feel about natural gas?"
CA: All right, so you don't support a carbon tax of any kind or a price on carbon.
Your picture then I guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately, that we'll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive?
TBP: Solar and wind, Jim and I agreed on that in 13 seconds.
CA: So how does the world get off fossil fuels?
TBP: How do we get there?
We have so much natural gas, a day will not come where you say, "Well let's don't use that anymore."
CA: So how does the world get off fossil fuels?
TBP: How do we get there?
We have so much natural gas, a day will not come where you say, "Well let's don't use that anymore."
You'll keep using it. It is the cleanest of all.
And if you look at California, they use 2,500 buses.
LAMTA have been on natural gas for 25 years.
Bernadine Healy, Dr. Healy, was a cardiologist.
And right around that time, in the 1980's, that we saw women and heart disease deaths going up, up, up, up, up, she wrote an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine and said, the Yentl syndrome.
Women are dying of heart disease, two, three, four times more than men.
Men just have to dump it in a single area."
So we said, "Let's look at these."
And so the yellow is the fatty plaque, and panel A is a man.
And the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them.
And I was initially resistant, because I always think poetry can stand alone by itself.
Attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results, in all cases.
It wants only to be here tomorrow, dressed perhaps in the sleeve of a plaid shirt, nose pressed against the page, writing a few more dutiful lines while I gaze out the window and imagine Budapest or some other city where I have never been.
BC: So that makes it seem a little easier.
Writing is not actually as easy as that for me.
The next poem is also rather short.
Poetry just says a few things in different ways.
And I think you could boil this poem down to saying, "Some days you eat the bear, other days the bear eats you."
Very funny.
But how would you like it if you never knew from one day to the next if you were going to spend it striding around like a vivid god, your shoulders in the clouds, or sitting down there amidst the wallpaper staring straight ahead with your little plastic face?
BC: There's a horror movie in there somewhere.
It has floated away down a dark mythological river whose name begins with an L as far as you can recall, well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those who have forgotten even how to swim and how to ride a bicycle.
No wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war.
No wonder the Moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart.
And then he'd come down to New York City and I'd teach him what I knew, which was largely smoking and drinking.
And in that way we traded lore with each other.
The poem that's coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of etiquette in country living that I had a very hard time, at first, processing.
I mean, we had the wheel for some time.
And schlepping is an ancient and honorable art.
I just have time to read a more recent poem to you.

And it's addressed to a certain person.


Look, I had second thoughts, really, about whether I could talk about this to such a vital and alive audience as you guys.
A giant battery could.
With a giant battery, we'd be able to address the problem of intermittency that prevents wind and solar from contributing to the grid in the same way that coal, gas and nuclear do today.
You see, the battery is the key enabling device here.
The process was invented in 1886 by a couple of 22-year-olds -- Hall in the United States and Heroult in France.
And just a few short years following their discovery, aluminum changed from a precious metal costing as much as silver to a common structural material.
You're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter.
You're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter.
It's about 50 feet wide and recedes about half a mile -- row after row of cells that, inside, resemble Volta's battery, with three important differences.
Volta's battery works at room temperature.
And if you ask these people why they work on liquid metal battery, their answer would hearken back to President Kennedy's remarks at Rice University in 1962 when he said -- and I'm taking liberties here -- "We choose to work on grid-level storage, not because it is easy, but because it is hard."
So this is the evolution of the liquid metal battery.
We start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell.
So today at LMBC, we're building cells 16 inches in diameter with a capacity of one kilowatt-hour -- 1,000 times the capacity of that initial shotglass cell.
We call that the pizza.
And then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon.
We call that the pizza.
And then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon.
It's going to be 36 inches in diameter.
And finally, human resources: Conventional wisdom says hire battery experts, seasoned professionals, who can draw upon their vast experience and knowledge.
To develop liquid metal battery, I hired students and post-docs and mentored them.
In a battery, I strive to maximize electrical potential; when mentoring, I strive to maximize human potential.
If you want to know how, ask yourself this question: What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?
If you really ask yourself this question, you can't help but feel uncomfortable.

At Mach 20, we can fly from New York to Long Beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds.
At that speed, the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel -- 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit -- like a blast furnace.
We are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it.

And we are flying it, or trying to.
DARPA's hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built.
Now the Minotaur IV has too much impulse, so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an 89 degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory.
That's an unnatural act for a rocket.
The third stage has a camera.

If a Mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from New York to Long Beach, a hummingbird would take, well, days.
You see, hummingbirds are not hypersonic, but they are maneuverable.
In fact, the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards.
It can fly in all directions, even backwards.
It can hover and rotate.
This prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera.

And it is the first time that Tim has held Katie's hand in seven years.
That moment mattered to Tim and Katie, and this green goo may someday matter to you.
This green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life.
And if it seems far-fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy, what about gamers that could solve problems that experts can't solve?
Last September, the gamers of Foldit solved the three-dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to AIDS in rhesus monkeys.
Now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments.
The gamers of Foldit solved it in 15 days.
Now they were able to do so by working together.
They were able to work together because they're connected by the Internet.
So that glider of yours, the Mach 20 glider, the first one, no control, it ended up in the Pacific I think somewhere.
RD: Yeah, yeah. It did.  Yeah, it also went into the Pacific.  We didn't fly it into the Pacific.
No, there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed.
RD: Well our responsibility is to develop the technology for this.
How it's ultimately used will be determined by the military.
Now the purpose of the vehicle though, the purpose of the technology, is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes.
Now the purpose of the vehicle though, the purpose of the technology, is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes.

And the theme they used was: "Even pretty girls vote."
They were able to mobilize young women.
But not only did they do that, they went to those who were running for seats to ask them, "What is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win?"
It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind.
Samuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that, for a moment, constitutes poetic faith.
MT: This faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience.
First of all, I wanted to give you a good visual first impression.
But the main reason I did it is that that's what happens to me when I'm forced to wear a Lady Gaga skanky mic.
I'm used to a stationary mic.
And lo and behold, soon enough, I was able to put this theory to the test on two books that I was working on for Knopf.
The first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs, and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich.
Now the Hepburn book was written in a very conversational style, it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you.
Now, luckily for me, I live and work in New York City, where there are plenty of dinosaurs.
So, I went to the Museum of Natural History, and I checked out the bones, and I went to the gift shop, and I bought a book.
And I was particularly taken with this page of the book, and more specifically the lower right-hand corner.

And David especially loved this design because at book signings, which he does a lot of, he could take a magic marker and do this.
Hello!
He did not think so, however, but his coworkers did an intervention and they said, "You are going to rehab, or you will be fired and you will die."
Now to me, this was always going to be a typographic solution, what I would call the opposite of Type 101.
What does that mean?
Usually on the first day of Introduction to Typography, you get the assignment of, select a word and make it look like what it says it is. So that's Type 101, right?
Very simple stuff.
This is going to be the opposite of that.
This is going to be the opposite of that.
I want this book to look like it's lying to you, desperately and hopelessly, the way an alcoholic would.
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine.

I set up the type, I printed it out on an Epson printer with water-soluble ink, taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it. Presto!
All right, so I got a collection of the paintings together and I looked at them and I deconstructed them and I put them back together.
And so, here's the design, right?
And so here's the front and the spine, and it's flat.
Now the Apple guys are texting, "Develop odor emission plug-in."
And the last story I'm going to talk about is quite a story.
A woman named Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom, she can't help but feel that, all of a sudden, she's entered a new reality that's just slightly different from the one that she left, but very similar, but different.
We're talking a 900-page book that is as weird as it is compelling, and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a German Shepherd to explode.
Not exactly Jackie Collins.
Fourteen weeks on the Best Seller list, eight printings, and still going strong.
This map shows the presence of agriculture on planet Earth.
The green areas are the areas we use to grow crops, like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever.
That's 16 million square kilometers' worth of land.
So we're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture, but also we're using a lot of water.
This is a photograph flying into Arizona, and when you look at it, you're like, "What are they growing here?" It turns out they're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert using water sprayed on top.
Now, the irony is, it's probably sold in our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities.
Well, the Colorado on a typical day in the 1950s, this is just, you know, not a flood, not a drought, kind of an average day, it looks something like this.
But if we come back today, during a normal condition to the exact same location, this is what's left.
The difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food, or maybe golf courses in Scottsdale, you take your pick.
Now, a lot you will remember this from your geography classes.
This is in the former Soviet Union in between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, one of the great inland seas of the world.
But there's kind of a paradox here, because it looks like it's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here?
So we have this incredible presence today of agriculture dominating our planet, whether it's 40 percent of our land surface, 70 percent of the water we use, 30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions.
We've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus around the world simply by using fertilizers, causing huge problems of water quality from rivers, lakes, and even oceans, and it's also the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss.
So without a doubt, agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age. No question.
And it rivals climate change in importance.
And they're both happening at the same time.
But what's really important here to remember is that it's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing.
And they're both happening at the same time.
But what's really important here to remember is that it's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing.
In fact, we completely depend on it.
But how?
How do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet?
We already know climate change is a big problem.
The consequence?
Widespread water pollution and massive degradation of lakes and rivers.
Surprisingly, agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change.

There is no single solution.
We need collaboration, imagination, determination, because failure is not an option.
♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫ ♫ Shady Grove, my darlin' ♫ ♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫ ♫ Going back to Harlan ♫ That sound was just so beautiful, the sound of Doc's voice and the rippling groove of the banjo.
And after being totally and completely obsessed with the mammoth richness and history of Chinese culture, it was like this total relief to hear something so truly American and so truly awesome.
I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China.
And in this particular chapter, it's children whose mothers wouldn't allow them to travel to the photographic shoot for fear that their fathers would kidnap them during it.
Twenty-four European rabbits were brought to Australia in 1859 by a British settler for sporting purposes, for hunting.
And within a hundred years, that population of 24 had exploded to half a billion.
They chose a large family from Beijing for its size, and they declined to give me any further reasoning for their choice.
This is one of the rare situations where I have no empty portraits.

Chapter 17 is an exploration of the absence of a bloodline and the absence of a history.
Children at this Ukrainian orphanage are between the ages of six and 16.
And last year I was holding her and I said, "Sophia, I love you more than anything in the universe."
And she turned to me and said, "Daddy, universe or multiverse?"
But barring such an anomalous upbringing, it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours, most with fundamentally different features, that would rightly be called universes of their own.

Now let's fast-forward to the 1990s when those two teams of astronomers I mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing.
And they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies, allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time.
Here's the surprise: They found that the expansion is not slowing down.
And they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies, allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time.
Here's the surprise: They found that the expansion is not slowing down.
Instead they found that it's speeding up, going faster and faster.
Instead they found that it's speeding up, going faster and faster.
That's like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster.
Now if you saw an apple do that, you'd want to know why.
Here it is.
When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up, look at what they found.
This number is small.
Now you might wonder, should you care?
Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue, a technical detail of interest to experts, but of no relevance to anybody else.
Well it surely is a technical detail, but some details really matter.
First off, what is it?
Well it's an approach to realize Einstein's dream of a unified theory of physics, a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe.
And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward.
These little fundamental strings, when they vibrate in different patterns, they produce different kinds of particles -- so electrons, quarks, neutrinos, photons, all other particles would be united into a single framework, as they would all arise from vibrating strings.
It's a compelling picture, a kind of cosmic symphony, where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little, tiny strings can play.
But there's a cost to this elegant unification, because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work.
The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important, the Bang.
It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang, but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself.
And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory.
It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang, but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself.
And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory.
It's called inflationary cosmology, which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space.
Because the theory predicts that the Big Bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded, tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world, yielding a distinctive fingerprint, a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots, across space, which powerful telescopes have now observed.
Going further, if there are other universes, the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide.
And if our universe got hit by another, that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect.
And this is the kind of change you can get for that.
And by the end of the day you get something better than a TED Prize, which is this great laugh from a kid that lives in the favela.

There should be some kind of brain trust.
So the Hirshhorn, as we began to think about it, and as we evolved the mission, with Richard and his team -- it's really his life blood.
But beyond exhibiting contemporary art, the Hirshhorn will become a public forum, a place of discourse for issues around arts, culture, politics and policy.

In fact, three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil, not in supply, but in demand.
And Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016.
Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered, Denmark 36.
And it's how all of Europe can shift to renewable electricity.
In America, our aging, dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050.
Well that's what's actually happened so far.
It's fallen by half.
But with today's much better technologies, more mature delivery channels and integrative design, we can do far more and even cheaper.
I've described not just a once-in-a-civilization business opportunity, but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species.
We humans are inventing a new fire, not dug from below, but flowing from above; not scarce, but bountiful; not local, but everywhere; not transient, but permanent; not costly, but free.
And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure, this new fire is flameless.

You're 200 yards away, you realize you've got five seconds to go, you floor it.
The Koreans, very assiduously, did test both.
What you also notice is that in any case our perception is leaky.
We can't tell the difference between the quality of the food and the environment in which we consume it.
All of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or valeted.
He didn't read a note, and he was profoundly hearing impaired.
Yet, he was my greatest teacher.
Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids, his understanding of music was profound.
He said, "There are only two things that matter in music: what and how.
And the thing about classical music, that what and how, it's inexhaustible."
That was his passion for the music.
And the thing about classical music, that what and how, it's inexhaustible."
That was his passion for the music.
Both my parents really loved it.
That was his passion for the music.
Both my parents really loved it.
They didn't know all that much about it, but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them.
Both my parents really loved it.
They didn't know all that much about it, but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them.
And I think inspired by that memory, it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as I can, sort of pass it on through whatever means.
So for example, in the 11th century, people liked pieces that ended like this.
And in the 17th century, it was more like this.
And in the 21st century ...
And in the 17th century, it was more like this.
And in the 21st century ...
Now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord, even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room.
And the reason you like it is because you've inherited, whether you knew it or not, centuries-worth of changes in musical theory, practice and fashion.
And in classical music we can follow these changes very, very accurately because of the music's powerful silent partner, the way it's been passed on: notation.
Now the impulse to notate, or, more exactly I should say, encode music has been with us for a very long time.
And then in the 13th century, more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly, and that led to the kind of notation we have today.
Well notation not only passed the music on, notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely, because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale.
Now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded, saved, considered, prioritized, made into intricate designs.
And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues, like gripping ones of culture, such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality.
But whatever direction the music took, one thing until recently was always the same, and that was when the musicians stopped playing, the music stopped.
Now this moment so fascinates me.
Now this moment so fascinates me.
I find it such a profound one.
What happens when the music stops?
To me this is the intimate, personal side of music.
It's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it.
And to me that's the most essential of all.
Mostly it's been a person-to-person thing, and then around 1880 came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally created a new and miraculous way of passing things on, albeit an impersonal one.
People could now hear music all the time, even though it wasn't necessary for them to play an instrument, read music or even go to concerts.
And technology democratized music by making everything available.
The symphony: Isaac Stern, the concerto, I heard it."
And I thought, my God, how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed, across the room to recover the memory of this music that, after everything else in his life is sloughing away, still means so much to him?
Well, that's why I take every performance so seriously, why it matters to me so much.
There's just a role here for so many people -- teachers, parents, performers -- to be explorers together.
Sure, the big events attract a lot of attention, but what really matters is what goes on every single day.
We need your perspectives, your curiosity, your voices.
And then life was fine, dandy.
Everything was okay, until I got to about the age of 26, and I went to a movie called "Short Circuit."
Oh, some of you have seen it.
And everything I saw in the cultivation said there were huge fights amongst the foodies between the cultivators and the hunter-gatherers.
And this is happening here.
When I moved to preparation, this same thing was true, expect that there were two schools.
But getting down can be a challenge for small cubs.
These mountains are dangerous places, but ultimately the fate of these bear families, and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific, depends on the salmon.
KB: I love that shot.
For a filmmaker, new technology is an amazing tool, but the other thing that really, really excites me is when new species are discovered.
Now, when I heard about one animal, I knew we had to get it for my next series, Untamed Americas, for National Geographic.
In 2005, a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of Ecuador.



Guy: Joey!
Crowd: Whoa!
Renny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay.
rather than the reverse. Think of it.
And this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment.
We tried, with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese, which smells badly after feet, to attract African malaria mosquitos.

And you know what? It worked.
We tried, with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese, which smells badly after feet, to attract African malaria mosquitos.
And you know what? It worked.
In fact, it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that we're using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos than humans.
Limburg, be proud of your cheese, as it is now used in the fight against malaria.
That's the cheese, just to show you.
My second story is remarkable as well.
And they're accessible. You can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there, right?
So the problem that we face with this is that, throughout the landscape, all these pools of water with the larvae, they are scattered all over the place, which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides.
And last year we thought very, very hard, how can we resolve this problem? Until we realized that just like us, we have a unique smell, that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell.
And so we set up another crazy experiment, because we collected the smell of these larvae, put it on pieces of cloth, and then did something very remarkable.
Here we have a bar with four holes, and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole.
Ooh, that was very quick.
Take marriage for example.
In the Western world, divorce rates are about 40 percent.
That means that out of five married couples, two will end up splitting their assets.
But if we believe we're better than the other guy, well that means that we're more likely to get that promotion, to remain married, because we're more social, more interesting.
And it's a global phenomenon.
The optimism bias has been observed in many different countries -- in Western cultures, in non-Western cultures, in females and males, in kids, in the elderly.
And it's a global phenomenon.
The optimism bias has been observed in many different countries -- in Western cultures, in non-Western cultures, in females and males, in kids, in the elderly.
It's quite widespread.
People with mild depression, they don't have a bias when they look into the future.
They're actually more realistic than healthy individuals.
But individuals with severe depression, they have a pessimistic bias.
But it also changes objective reality.
It acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
And that is the third reason why lowering your expectations will not make you happy.
And it's not that they didn't remember the numbers that we gave them; everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer is about 30 percent and the average likelihood of divorce is about 40 percent.
But they didn't think that those numbers were related to them.
What this means is that warning signs such as these may only have limited impact.
The British government, for example, has acknowledged that the optimism bias can make individuals more likely to underestimate the costs and durations of projects.
So they have adjusted the 2012 Olympic budget for the optimism bias.
My friend who's getting married in a few weeks has done the same for his wedding budget.


So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language.
And when the stuff of history is available in digital form, it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis to very quickly and very conveniently review trends in our history and our culture.
So I think in the next decade, the sciences and the humanities will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about mankind.
And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that.
He was making a horse out of the clay that our teacher kept under the sink.
And at one point, one of the girls who was sitting at his table, seeing what he was doing, leaned over and said to him, "That's terrible. That doesn't look anything like a horse."
And Brian's shoulders sank.
And when they touched the snake everything was fine. They were cured.
In fact, everything was better than fine.
These people who had life-long fears of snakes were saying things like, "Look how beautiful that snake is."
And he would take this new knowledge and do something quite extraordinary.
He would redesign the entire experience of being scanned.
And this is what he came up with.
But Doug's results that he cared about were much more qualitative.
He was with one of the mothers waiting for her child to come out of the scan.
And when the little girl came out of her scan, she ran up to her mother and said, "Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"
And that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain, rather than just looking at its overall shape.
Imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works and all you could see was a keyboard, a mouse, a screen.
You really would be kind of out of luck.
And up until a little more than a century ago, nobody was able to do that with the brain.
Nobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring.
And that's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it, put it under even a very powerful microscope, there's nothing there.

And that's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it, put it under even a very powerful microscope, there's nothing there.
It's gray, formless.
The computer was cracked open.
So what really launched modern neuroscience was a stain called the Golgi stain.
And it works in a very particular way.

And it works in a very particular way.
Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue, it somehow only stains about one percent of them.
Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue, it somehow only stains about one percent of them.
It clears the forest, reveals the trees inside.
If everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible.
And there's several ways of doing this.
But one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein.
Now green fluorescent protein, which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish, is very useful.
Now green fluorescent protein, which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish, is very useful.
Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell, that cell will glow green -- or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein, you get a cell to glow many different colors.
And so coming back to the brain, this is from a genetically engineered mouse called "Brainbow."
There should be even more schools doing this kind of project.
Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine.
So we went there with a truck. This is a photobooth truck.
It sort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology.
This is an explorer of the unseen world, Martinus Beijerinck.
So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease.
What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters.
And he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known -- bacteria, at the time.
He came up with a name for his mystery agent.
A hundred years from now, people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses.
It's true, we may have charted all the continents on the planet and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there, but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth.
Beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers -- people like that young girl from Beloit, Wisconsin.
You don't want me to juggle, right?
Thank you. Thank you.
Each time I street juggle I use improvisation.
Let's begin with a story.
Once upon a time -- well actually less than two years ago -- in a kingdom not so very far away, there was a man who traveled many miles to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown -- an internationally famous company.
Let's call it Island Networks.
Once upon a time -- well actually less than two years ago -- in a kingdom not so very far away, there was a man who traveled many miles to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown -- an internationally famous company.
Let's call it Island Networks.
Now this kingdom had many resources and mighty ambitions, but the one thing it lacked was people.
What was his terrible crime?
He was infected with HIV.
Now the kingdom is one of about 50 countries that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay of people living with HIV.
And looking globally as well, deaths are also starting to fall.
There are many reasons for these positive developments, but one of the most remarkable is in the increase in the number of people around the world the medicines they need to keep their HIV in check.
Now there are still many problems.
But -- you know what I'm saying?
Because, as a hip hop thing, you know what I'm saying, TED be rocking -- you know what I'm saying.
Like so I wrote a song, and I hope you guys dig it.
Four years ago I worked with a few people at the Brookings Institute, and I arrived at a conclusion.
Tomorrow is another day.
Not just any day, but it is a day.
Not just any day, but it is a day.
It will get here, there's no question.
And the important thing to remember is that this simulation is a good one.
Now, the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the Telegarden.
As it was operating, my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other, and what they were doing with the garden.
So we started thinking: what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment?



Yes. Here it is. It's the bicycle. It's 80 times better in energy consumption, and it's powered by biofuel, by Weetabix.
And there are other options in between, because maybe the lady in the tank would say, "No, no, no, that's a lifestyle change. Don't change my lifestyle, please."
So, well, we could persuade her to get into a train, and that's still a lot more efficient than a car, but that might be a lifestyle change, or there's the eco-car, top-left.
Now Codex C was only discovered in 1906, and it landed on my desk in Baltimore on the 19th of January, 1999.
And this is Codex C here.
Now Codex C is actually buried in this book.
Now Codex C is actually buried in this book.
It's buried treasure.
Because this book is actually a prayer book.
They weren't in A and B at all; they were completely new texts by Archimedes, and they were called "The Method" and "The Stomachion."
And it became a world famous manuscript.
Now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition.
And it became a world famous manuscript.
Now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition.
It got in worse condition in the 20th century after Heiberg saw it.

Forgeries were painted over it, and it suffered very badly from mold.

This book is the definition of a write-off.
It's the sort of book that you thought would be in an institution.
It's polyvinyl acetate emulsion that doesn't dissolve in water once it's dry.
And it's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on.
And so before we could start imaging Archimedes, we had to take this book apart.
And the image on the left is the normal red image.
And the image on the right is an ultraviolet image.
And in the image on the right you might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing.
If you merge them together into one digital canvas, the parchment is bright in both images and it comes out bright.
The prayer book is dark in both images and it comes out dark.
The Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another.
And there we are, I can give them to you.
With this kind of imaging -- this kind of infrared, ultraviolet, invisible light imaging -- we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries.
How were we going to do that?
Because the ink was written in iron.
And if we can map where this X-ray that comes out, where it comes from, we can map all the iron on the page, then theoretically we can read the image.
The thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this.
Because the Web of the ancient manuscripts of the future isn't going to be built by institutions.
It's going to be built by users, by people who get this data together, by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from, all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from, people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things.
And that is the future of the Web.
If an act of desperation by a Tunisian fruit vendor sparked these revolutions, it was the difference between what Arabs experienced and what they expected that provided the fuel.
To tell you what I mean, consider this trend in Egypt.
On paper the country was doing great.
As the country got more well-off, unemployment actually rose and people's satisfaction with things like housing and education plummeted.
But it wasn't just anger at economic injustice.
It was also people's deep longing for freedom.
And the reason that they're expecting a lot is because they have a new-found hope for the future.
So right before the revolution we said that Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives, but not only that, they thought their future would be no better.
What really changed after the ouster of Mubarak wasn't that life got easier.
The idea dates from 1960, when a young astronomer by the name of Frank Drake used this antenna in West Virginia, pointed it at a couple of nearby stars in the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T.
Now, Frank didn't hear anything.
Actually he did, but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force, which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence.
But we're going through the haystack no longer with a teaspoon but with a skip loader, because of this increase in speed.
In fact, those of you who are still conscious and mathematically competent, will note that this is a semi-log plot.
In other words, the rate of increase is exponential.
And I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right?
I kept waiting for -- I kept waiting for my mom to call, somebody to call, the government to call. Nobody called.
Nobody called. I was so nervous that I couldn't sit down. I just wandered around taking photos like this one, just for something to do.
You've heard about it.
Well, here's one example, in fact.
Polls taken, this poll was taken 10 years ago.
These sorts of ideas don't really have any validity, that you can't trust the scientists.
Now, we've got to solve that problem, because that's a critically important problem, and you might say, "Well, okay, how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI?"
Well, let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't solve the problem, but it can address the problem.
It's hard. There's no doubt about it.
And in fact, here's an example: the Higgs boson, finding the Higgs boson.
Ask the next 10 people you see on the streets, "Hey, do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson?"
What I see is the generation behind me.
These are some kids from the Huff School, fourth graders.
I talked there, what, two weeks ago, something like that.
All right. So, like all good stories, this starts a long, long time ago when there was basically nothing.
So here is a complete picture of the universe about 14-odd billion years ago.
All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy.
And within these galaxies you get these enormous dust clouds.
And I want you to pay particular attention to the three little prongs in the center of this picture.
If you take a close-up of those, they look like this.
And as you take a close-up of this galaxy, you find a relatively normal, not particularly interesting star.
By the way, you're now about two-thirds of the way into this story.
So this star doesn't even appear until about two-thirds of the way into this story.
And then what happens is there's enough dust left over that it doesn't ignite into a star, it becomes a planet.
And this is about a little over four billion years ago.
And soon thereafter there's enough material left over that you get a primordial soup, and that creates life.
And as they pick that, these become bone, and then they pick another road and these become platelets, and these become macrophages, and these become T cells.
But it's really hard, once you ski down, to get back up.
Unless, of course, if you have a ski lift.

But it's really hard, once you ski down, to get back up.
Unless, of course, if you have a ski lift.
And the slide behind me barely scratches the surface of how widespread they are in animals.
There's an enormous amount of anatomical variation.
You find muscular tubes, modified legs, modified fins, as well as the mammalian fleshy, inflatable cylinder that we're all familiar with -- or at least half of you are.
I tried a bunch of different stuff.
A lot of it didn't pan out.
But then one day I started thinking about the mammalian penis.

Most of the time it's a flexible organ.
It's easy to bend.
Most of the time it's a flexible organ.
It's easy to bend.
But before it's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid, it has to become difficult to bend.
The skeletal support comes from an interaction between a pressurized fluid and a surrounding wall of tissue that's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins.
And the interaction is crucial.
Without both elements you have no support.
It's a model skeleton that I made out of a piece of cloth that I wrapped around an inflated balloon.
The cloth's cut on the bias.
So you can see that the fibers wrap in helices, and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves, which means the skeleton's flexible.
So I spent a long, long time thinking about it.
And one thing kept bothering me, and that's, when they're functioning, penises don't wiggle.
So something interesting had to be going on.
So I spent a long, long time thinking about it.
And one thing kept bothering me, and that's, when they're functioning, penises don't wiggle.
So something interesting had to be going on.
And you'll see that, unlike the cross helical model, this model resists extension and contraction and resists bending.
Now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues.
They're an integral part of the penile skeleton.
The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can't be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn't have that SH, that "sh" sound.
So by convention, they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound, "ck" sound, from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai.
Later when this material was translated into a common European language, which is to say Latin, they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X.

Today I'm going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design, and it makes perfect sense that I should be the one to do it because I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature.
But I'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of Design Within Reach catalogs, so I pretty much know everything there is.

Now, I'm sure you recognize this object; many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days.
This is known as the Theme Building; that is its name for reasons that are still very murky.

It was first excavated in 1961 as they were building LAX, although scientists believe that it dates back to the year 2000 Before Common Era, when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants.

It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located, of course, at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design, the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously, the much better access to parking.

No, I have an iPhone. Of course I do.
Here is my well-loved iPhone.
I do so many things on this little device.

This is a design that once you saw it, you forgot about it.
It is easy to forget the gasp-inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life.
Unlike the Theme Building, this is not alien technology.

Or I should say, what it did was it took technology which, unlike people in this room, to many other people in the world, still feels very alien, and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate.
Were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point, and intervene and treat, I can tell you, and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years, this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition.
Also, we have a window of opportunity, because the brain is malleable for just so long, and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life.
It's not that that window closes. It doesn't.
And so in the past many years we've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking.
We can see moment by moment what children are engaging with.
Well, this is my colleague Warren Jones, with whom we've been building these methods, these studies, for the past 12 years, and you see there a happy five-month-older, it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world, his mom, the caregiver, but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare.
What are the children with autism doing?
They are focusing on the revolving door, opening and shutting.
Well, I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen only in our five-minute experiment.
That's not the idea.
What we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times, the profound intellectual disabilities, the lack of language, the profound, profound isolation.
We feel that individuals with autism, in fact, have a very special perspective on the world, and we need diversity, and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength: predictable situations, situations that can be defined.
I had to figure out what it is my dad did and why it was important.
Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up, you know, "Bad design is just people not thinking, John," he would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or, say, a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen.
You know, "Design -- bad design, there's just no excuse for it.
You know, "Design -- bad design, there's just no excuse for it.
It's letting stuff happen without thinking about it.
Every object should be about something, John.
Dad helped design the control panels for the IBM 360 computer.
That was a big deal; that was important. He worked for Kodak for a while; that was important.
He designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for Steelcase; that was important.
We had lots of old jazz records lying around the house.
And he said, "No, never, John, never.
The song is just a given, that's how you have to think about it.
All of us? Designers?
Oh, oh, Dad. Oh, Dad.
The song is just a given.
But ever since then, the wheelchair has been a given in my life.
My life, at the mercy of good design and bad design.
Think about it. Now, in design terms, a wheelchair is a very difficult object.
He went back to the streets of Kinshasa; I went to my hotel. And I think of him now, now ...
And I pose this question.
An object imbued with intent -- it has power, it's treasure, we're drawn to it.
My belief is that it's almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system, or even admit that we have any at all.
Because if we did, they would be so removed from our current reality.
But that doesn't change my belief that all of us, deep inside, here in this room and across this country, share a similar set of desires.
That if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly, that we all harbor one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare: that it keep us healthy.
This aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy is an enormously powerful one.
And the way I think about this is that healthcare is like any other system.
I just wanted a blessing, I didn't want some kind of mandate.
But the truth is I've spent every waking minute nearly since then chasing that vision.
I believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country.
But the truth is I've spent every waking minute nearly since then chasing that vision.
I believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country.
I believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare, it will not be by the diseases cured, but by the diseases prevented.
I believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country.
I believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare, it will not be by the diseases cured, but by the diseases prevented.
It will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists, but by how rarely we needed them.
We are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation, not story, is king.
What was common to us all 40 years ago -- the telling of stories between generations -- is now rarified.
As a filmmaker, it worried me.
In groups as large as 150 and as small as three, these young people discovered new places, new thoughts, new perspectives.
By the time the pilot had finished, we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join.
The film that changed my life is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, "Miracle in Milan."
Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema, find and pay for the print and the projectionist.
But for my father, the emotional and artistic importance of De Sica's vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half-century with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends, "In order," he said, "to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation."
In the last shot of "Miracle in Milan," slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms.

Sixty years after the film was made and 30 years after I first saw it, I see young faces tilt up in awe, their incredulity matching mine.
In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government, we screened "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."
Made in 1939, the film is older than most of our members' grandparents.
Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety.

It shows how to do right, how to be heroically awkward.
What would they do under the same conditions?
Was the tale told well?
Was there a hidden message?
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed.
They are, like other young people, negotiating a world with infinite choice, but little culture of how to find meaningful experience.
We appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes, yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered.
Run for your heterosexual lives, people.
When my partner, Steve, and I first started dating, he told me this story about penguins.
And I didn't know where he was going with it at first.
You may want to tell your spouse. Who, if they're in love, might be gay as well.
How many of you are single? Any single people out there?
You too might be gay! Because I know some gay people who are also single.
How many of you are single? Any single people out there?
You too might be gay! Because I know some gay people who are also single.
It's really scary, this gay lifestyle thing; it's super duper evil and there's no end to it!
What do they want?"
So, without further ado, I will present to you, ladies and gentlemen -- now be careful, 'cause it's evil -- a copy, the official copy, of the gay agenda.
The gay agenda, people!
The gay agenda, people!
There it is!
Did you soak it all in? The gay agenda.
I was blown away when I saw it. I was like, wait, this is the gay agenda?
Why didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about?
I wouldn't have been so confused; I wouldn't have been so upset.
That is the reason why I felt it was imperative that I presented you with this copy of the gay agenda.
Because I figured if I made it funny, you wouldn't be as threatened.
I figured if I was a bit irreverent, you wouldn't find it serious.
Freestyle itself, we developed all these flat ground tricks as you saw, but there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding, where guys were taking it to the streets, and they were using that ollie, like I showed you? They were using it to get up onto stuff like bleachers and handrails and over stairwells and all kinds of cool stuff.
So it was evolving upwards.
In fact, when someone tells you they're a skater today, they pretty much mean a street skater, because freestyle, it took about five years for it to die, and at that stage, I'd been a "champion" champion for 11 years, which, phew!
It's like skinboarding.
And this one, look how it slides sideways, every which way?
Okay, so when you're skating, and you take a fall, the board slips that way or that way. It's kind of predictable.
context shapes content.
This is a place not that far from here.
It's a rotten neighborhood. Your first consideration is, am I gonna get beat up? You go out and -- See this wall?
Next. These guys. Very similar community that's extremely conducive to innovation.
Notice a couple of these shots from the Police Department.
But it is quite similar. I mean, what is it to hack, right?

It's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it and steer it to do things it was never intended to do, right?
And they're not all bad.
In fact, one of them, he was Ernst & Young's Entrepreneur of the Year for San Diego County, so they're not, you never know who you're dealing with.
We've all had some degree of fame.
In fact, I've had so much success that I strangely always feel unworthy of.

I've had a patent, and that was cool, and we started a company, and it grew, and it became the biggest, and then it went down, and then it became the biggest again, which is harder than the first time, and then we sold it, and then we sold it again.
So I've had some success. And in the end, when you've had all of these things, what is it that continues to drive you? As I mentioned, the knee stuff and these things, what is it that will punch you?
Because it's not just the mind.
That's the corner I want to explore.
Before I do that, though, I want to spend a couple of minutes telling you how a death penalty case unfolds, and then I want to tell you two lessons that I have learned over the last 20 years as a death penalty lawyer from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way.
You can think of a death penalty case as a story that has four chapters.

The first chapter of every case is exactly the same, and it is tragic.
People in this room might disagree about whether Will should have been executed, but I think everybody would agree that the best possible version of his story would be a story where no murder ever occurs.
How do we do that?
When our son Lincoln was working on that math problem two weeks ago, it was a big, gnarly problem.
When our son Lincoln was working on that math problem two weeks ago, it was a big, gnarly problem.
And he was learning how, when you have a big old gnarly problem, sometimes the solution is to slice it into smaller problems.
That's what we do for most problems -- in math, in physics, even in social policy -- we slice them into smaller, more manageable problems.
But the thing is that for every 15,000 dollars in the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids in those earlier chapters, we save 80,000 dollars in crime-related costs down the road.
Even if you don't agree that there's a moral imperative that we do it, it just makes economic sense.
I want to tell you about the last conversation that I had with Will.
We are not using fossil energies.
We are not borrowing energy from our neighbors.
We're using energy we can harvest on our roofs, and also on the training pitches, which will be covered with large, flexible membranes, and we will see in the next years an industry coming up with flexible photovoltaics, giving the possibilities of shading against strong sun and producing electric energy in the same time.
Well, when I think of the future, I never see myself moving forward in time. I actually see time moving backward towards me.
I can actually visualize my future approaching.
I can dodge what I don't want and pull in what I want.
Well, when I think of the future, I never see myself moving forward in time. I actually see time moving backward towards me.
I can actually visualize my future approaching.
I can dodge what I don't want and pull in what I want.
We actually write it only to set our attitudes right.
You know, I used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy.
Education is great.
Education is great.
It really teaches us who we are, and helps us in the world, but it's really my creativity that's taught me that I can be much more than what my education told me I am.
I'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have.
So swift is the velocity of the techno-scientific revolution, so startling in its countless twists and turns, that no one can predict its outcome even a decade from the present moment.
There will come a time, of course, when the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge, which actually began in the 1600s, has to peak and level off, but that's not going to matter to you.
The revolution is going to continue for at least several more decades.
There are thousands of professionally delimited subjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry to biology and medicine.
And on then into the social sciences, where it is possible in short time to acquire the status of an authority.
When the subject is still very thinly populated, you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority.
Now, there's a funny thing going on here.
It doesn't look like anything's going on.
It looks like I've paused the program.
Right there, above, way above the solar system, way beyond our solar system.
And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there.
Now you know why, and to me, that's the point of this program.
When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China, it has, you know, led to considerable angst amongst the Western populations.
In fact, if you look at polls, they show a declining trend for support for free trade in the West.
Now, the Western elites, however, have said this fear is misplaced.
It could be new products and services, but it could also be new ways of producing products.
It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries.
Once you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation, the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.
It's because of an injection of intelligence into a process which was considered dead for a long time in the West.
And the last kind of innovation, invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call management innovation.
It's not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work, and the most significant management innovation to come out of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model.
Chimborazo!
So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple.
You just have to find another term and look that up.
They're all over the globe, but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests.
This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get "friended."
The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end.
Germans occupied Russia.
A Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household, and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut.
Years later, the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space, the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet.


So a few weeks ago, a friend of mine gave this toy car to his 8-year-old son.
So he made this thing that recognizes the cat from a chip mounted inside on the collar of the cat, and opens the door and the cat can eat the food.
This is made by recycling an old CD player that you can get from an old computer, some cardboard, tape, couple of sensors, a few blinking LEDs, and then suddenly you have a tool. You build something that you cannot find on the market.
And I like this phrase: "Scratch your own itch."
And this is a good way to learn, by looking at other people's work.
So the different elements of the project are all open, so the hardware is released with a Creative Commons license.
So, you know, I like this idea that hardware becomes like a piece of culture that you share and you build upon, like it was a song or a poem with Creative Commons.
Or somebody made a chair that twitters when somebody farts.  It's interesting how, in 2009, said that this project actually gives a meaning to Twitter, so it was — a lot changed in between.  So very serious project.
When the Fukushima disaster happened, a bunch of people in Japan, they realized that the information that the government was giving wasn't really open and really reliable, so they built this Geiger counter, plus Arduino, plus network interface. They made 100 of them and gave them to people around Japan, and essentially the data that they gathered gets published on this website called Cosm, another website they built, so you can actually get reliable real-time
information from the field, and you can get unbiased information.
This is a pH probe.
Or you get kids, like these kids, they're from Spain.
They learned how to program and to make robots when they were probably, like, 11, and then they started to use Arduino to make these robots that play football. They became world champions by making an Arduino-based robot.
Also, I come from Italy, and the design is important in Italy, and yet very conservative.
So we worked with a design studio called Habits, in Milan, to make this mirror, which is completely open-source.
This doubles also as an iPod speaker.
So I've started working with a few hundred kids, and I came to the conclusion that this is the first generation to come of age in the digital age, to be bathed in bits.
I call them the Net Generation.
I said, these kids are different.
And then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too.
But in the Tunisian revolution, the new media didn't cause the revolution; it was caused by injustice.
Social media didn't create the revolution; it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore.
And at night they come together and they create one of the most spectacular things in all of nature, and it's called a murmuration.
And scientists that have studied this have said they've never seen an accident.
Now, this thing has a function.
Hospitals are bad, they're mad, they're sad.
One must stay away. I'm God, or I used to be.'" At that point in the text, where I said "I'm God, or I used to be," my husband made a marginal note.
He said, "Did you quit or were you fired?"
The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment is called quantum levitation and quantum locking.
And the object that was levitating here is called a superconductor.
Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter, and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature.
In this movie here, you can see how they flow one by one discretely.
This is strands of magnetic field. These are not particles, but they behave like particles.
So, this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking.
Of course, I can turn it upside down, and it will remain locked.
Now, now that we understand that this so-called levitation is actually locking, Yeah, we understand that.
You won't be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet, in which the magnetic field is the same all around, the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet.
Why? Because as long as it rotates, the locking is maintained.
You see? I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor.
We have frictionless motion. It is still levitating, but can move freely all around.
Now, I can extend this circular magnet, and make whatever track I want.
For example, I can make a large circular rail here.
And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail, it moves freely.
And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail, it moves freely.
And again, that's not all. I can adjust its position like this, and rotate, and it freely moves in this new position.
And I can even try a new thing; let's try it for the first time.
But they're adapting quickly.
Recently, the FBI arrested an al Qaeda affiliate in the United States, who was planning on using these remote-controlled drone aircraft to fly C4 explosives into government buildings in the United States.
By the way, these travel at over 600 miles an hour.
It took us 30 years to get from the introduction of the personal computer to the level of cybercrime we have today, but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly, and knowing criminals and terrorists as I do, we may get there a lot faster with biocrime in the future.
It will be easy for anybody to go ahead and print their own bio-virus, enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax, weaponized flu.
We recently saw a case where some researchers made the H5N1 avian influenza virus more potent.
Anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future.
So maybe there's a more radical way that we can look at this.
What happens if we were to take the President's DNA, or a king or queen's, and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that DNA and do penetration testing against it as a means of helping our leaders?

When the BP oil spill happened, I was working at MIT, and I was in charge of developing an oil spill-cleaning technology.
And I had a chance to go in the Gulf of Mexico and meet some fishermen and see the terrible conditions in which they were working.
More than 700 of these boats, which are fishermen boats repurposed with oil absorbent in white and oil containment in orange, were used, but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface, and the health of the cleaners were very deeply affected.
And so, I thought, what about if we just take the rudder from the back of the boat to the front, would we have better control?
So I built this small sailing robot with the rudder at the front, and I was trying to pull something very long and heavy, so that's a four-meter-long object just to pull, and I was surprised with just a 14-centimeter rudder, I could control four meters of absorbent.
Then I was so happy that I kept playing with the robot, and so you see the robot has a front rudder here.
Other property is this: A normal sailing boat has a centerboard here and a rudder at the back, and these two things are what creates most resistance and turbulence behind the boat, but because this doesn't have either a centerboard or a rudder, we hope that if we keep working on this hull design we can improve and have less resistance.
The other thing is, most boats, when they reach a certain speed, and they are going on waves, they start to hit and slap on the surface of the water, and a lot of the energy moving forward is lost.
But if we're going with the flow, if we pay attention to natural patterns instead of trying to be strong, but if you're going with the flow, we may absorb a lot of environmental noises, so the wave energy, to actually save some energy to move forward.
This idea really appealed to Gabriella Levine in New York, and so she decided to prototype this idea that she saw, and she documented every step of the process, and she published it on Instructables, which is a website for sharing inventions.
Less than one week after, this is a team in Eindhoven, it's a school of engineering.
They made it, but they eventually published a simplified design.
They made it, but they eventually published a simplified design.
They also made it into an Instructable, and in less than one week, they had almost 10,000 views, and they got many new friends.
We're working on also simpler technology, not that complex, with younger people and also older people, like this dinosaur is from Mexico.  So Protei is now an international network of innovation for selling technology using this shape-shifting hull.
Usman, the official story is that you learned to play the guitar by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube.
Usman Riaz: Yes, that was the first one. And then I -- That was the first thing I learned, and then I started progressing to other things.
And I started watching Kaki King a lot, and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence, so then I started watching his videos, and it's very surreal right now to be --   CA: Was that piece just now, that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?

Now let me tell you that story.
It started two years ago, when I hit my head and got a concussion.
The concussion didn't heal properly, and after 30 days, I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches, nausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog.
Of course it's meant to be funny, but in all seriousness, suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries.
It happens to one in three, and it happened to me.
My brain started telling me, "Jane, you want to die."
Things like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes, or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once.
Now the game was that simple: Adopt a secret identity, recruit your allies, battle the bad guys, activate the power-ups.
But even with a game so simple, within just a couple days of starting to play, that fog of depression and anxiety went away.
I put up some blog posts and videos online, explaining how to play.
But not everybody has a concussion, obviously, not everyone wants to be "the slayer," so I renamed the game SuperBetter.
And soon, I started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity, recruiting their own allies, and they were getting "super better," facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain, depression and Crohn's disease.

Even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS.
And they even talked about feeling happier, even though they were in pain, even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives.
Now at the time, I'm thinking to myself, what is going on here?
I mean, how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious, and in some cases life-and-death, circumstances?

The game was helping us experience what scientists call post-traumatic growth, which is not something we usually hear about.
We usually hear about post-traumatic stress disorder.
But scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely.
Bonus physical resilience. Well done, everyone.
Now that's worth +1 mental resilience, which means you have more mental focus, more discipline, determination and willpower.
We know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle.
We have antibiotics in our kitchen counters, people are washing every part of them all of the time, we pump antibiotics into our food, into our communities, we take antibiotics excessively.
And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick, but we should understand that when we pump chemicals and antibiotics into our world, that we're also killing the cloud of microbes that live in and on us.
And excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children, has been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors for obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community.
And I was getting up every five minutes to pee, and drinking everybody's water at the table, and I think they all thought I was a druggie.
But the reason I'm telling you this is that the medical community, my father as an example, sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes.
The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.

So every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave and that emergent sine curve of fire.
So let's turn that off. We're indoors.

It's very similar to a Rubens' tube, and it's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sound, such as eigenmodes, so let's fire it up and see what it does.
All right, so it's a delicate dance.
If you watch closely —  If you watch closely, you may have seen some of the eigenmodes, but also you may have seen that jazz music is better with fire.
Actually, a lot of things are better with fire in my world, but the fire's just a foundation.
It shows very well that eyes can hear, and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound, such as the removal of time.
So here, I'm using a rendering algorithm to paint the frequencies of the song "Smells Like Teen Spirit" in a way that the eyes can take them in as a single visual impression, and the technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition.
So if I show you another song off this album, and another, your eyes will easily pick out the use of repetition by the band Nirvana, and in the frequency distribution, the colors, you can see the clean-dirty-clean sound that they are famous for, and here is the entire album as a single visual impression, and I think this impression is pretty powerful.
All right, from skate physics to theoretical physics.
I'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking, and I wanted to use all eight hours of his Cambridge lecture series to create an homage.
Now, in this series he's speaking with the aid of a computer, which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences fairly easy. So I wrote a steering algorithm.
And these trend lines, you can see, there's more questions than answers in the laws of physics, and when we reach the end of a sentence, we place a star at that location.
So there's a lot of sentences, so a lot of stars, and after rendering all of the audio, this is what we get.
This is Stephen Hawking's universe.
All right. Let me close with a work in progress.
I think, after 30 years, the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning.
Now, we've all seen a lot of TEDTalks online, so let's watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on.

There's no closed captioning for the TED theme song, and we're missing it, but if you've watched enough of these, you hear it in your mind's ear, and then applause starts.
You see, I have a passion for racing.
In the past, I've been a race car owner, a crew chief and a driving coach, although maybe not at the level that you're currently expecting.
One of the things that we've developed in the lab -- we've developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world's first autonomously drifting car.

It's another one of those categories where maybe there's not a lot of competition.
But this is P1. It's an entirely student-built electric vehicle, which through using its rear-wheel drive and front-wheel steer-by-wire can drift around corners.
So you might ask at this point why she's calling you.
Well, so did I.
But it turned out there was a technical twist to Carol's case.
I remember vividly the week it all came together.
We built it at my home, which means that I got a little extra help from my three-year-old son Ramon.
Here's Ramon —  — looking for a little attention from Dad that week.
These, to me, are like living sculptures, right, that you can go and look at, and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal's life.
So I was thinking about my own life, and how I'd like to memorialize my life, you know, for the ages, and also —  — the lives of my friends, but the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen on the idea of me taxidermy-ing them.  So instead, I turned to video, and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time.
So what I did was, I filmed six of my friends and then, using video mapping and video projection, I created a video sculpture, which was these six friends projected into jars.  So now I have this collection of my friends I can take around with me whenever I go, and this is called Animalia Chordata, from the Latin nomenclature for human being, classification system.
But something about the first piece, the Animali Chordata piece, kept coming back to me, this idea of interaction with art, and I really liked the idea of people being able to interact, and also being challenged by interacting with art.
So I wanted to create a new piece that actually forced people to come and interact with something, and the way I did this was actually by projecting a 1950s housewife into a blender.  This is a piece called Blend, and what it does is it actually makes you implicit in the work of art.
You may never experience the entire thing yourself.
And if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times in one day, the piece goes black and is not to be reset until the next day.
So, in doing so, you're erasing time.
You're actually implicit in this work and you're erasing my life.
So, let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that and how I went about it.
So, to begin with, however, I have to give you a very, very quick lesson in developmental biology, with apologies to those of you who know some biology.
So, when your mom and dad met, there is a fertilized egg, that round thing with that little blip.
It grows and then it grows, and then it makes this handsome man.
So, this guy, with all the cells in his body, all have the same genetic information.
So how did his nose become his nose, his elbow his elbow, and why doesn't he get up one morning and have his nose turn into his foot?
So how did his nose become his nose, his elbow his elbow, and why doesn't he get up one morning and have his nose turn into his foot?
It could. It has the genetic information.
You all remember, dolly, it came from a single mammary cell.
All you need is a single oncogene.
So, they put the cells in cultures, chicken cells, dumped the virus on it, and it would pile up, and they would say, this is malignant and this is normal.
And again this didn't make sense to me.
So for various reasons, we took this oncogene, attached it to a blue marker, and we injected it into the embryos.
Now look at that. There is that beautiful feather in the embryo.
Every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell, and they're part of the feather.
The normal example, let's take the human mammary gland.
I work on breast cancer.
So, here is a lovely human breast.
And we said, wonderful! Look at this pretty structure.
We want to make this a structure, and ask the question, how do the cells do that?
So, we took the red cells -- you see the red cells are surrounded by blue, other cells that squeeze them, and behind it is material that people thought was mainly inert, and it was just having a structure to keep the shape, and so we first photographed it with the electron microscope years and years ago, and you see this cell is actually quite pretty.
All right. And here is this beautiful human cell, and you can imagine that here also, context goes.
So, what do we do now?
I made a radical hypothesis.
And I always say to the students and post-docs I lecture to, don't be arrogant, because arrogance kills curiosity.
Curiosity and passion.
You need to always think, what else needs to be discovered?
Look at it. It's constantly doing this.
Has a coherent movement.
You put the cancer cells there, and they do go all over, they do this. They don't do this.
Well I used to love English literature, and I debated in college, which one should I do?
And unfortunately or fortunately, chemistry won.
But here is a poem from Yeats. I'll just read you the last two lines.
Both, if we're honest, a bust.
Our world leaders, our global politics, currently can't get it done.
They need our help. They need the cavalry, and the cavalry's not going to come from Mars.
To me, the sky is always gray, flowers are always gray, and television is still in black and white.
But, since the age of 21, instead of seeing color, I can hear color.
In 2003, I started a project with computer scientist Adam Montandon, and the result, with further collaborations with Peter Kese from Slovenia and Matias Lizana from Barcelona, is this electronic eye.
I started to have favorite colors, and I started to dream in colors.
So, when I started to dream in color is when I felt that the software and my brain had united, because in my dreams, it was my brain creating electronic sounds. It wasn't the software, so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg.
It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device.
It's just fabulous.  Also, the way I dress has changed.
Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.
Now I dress in a way that it sounds good.   So today I'm dressed in C major, so it's quite a happy chord.  If I had to go to a funeral, though, I would dress in B minor, which would be turquoise, purple and orange.  Also, food, the way I look at food has changed, because now I can display the food on a plate, so I can eat my favorite song.
So I connect the eye, and then I play the audience's faces.
The good thing about this is, if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.
It's not my fault, because —  And so another thing that happens is that I started having this secondary effect that normal sounds started to become color.
That's to prevent pirates from attacking it.
Piracy is a very active threat today around the world. This is in the Indian Ocean.
Piracy is also very active in the Strait of Malacca.
The answer is, we are teaching them to read in literacy courses by NATO in partnership with private sector entities, in partnership with development agencies.
We've taught well over 200,000 Afghan Security Forces to read and write at a basic level.
When you can read and write in Afghanistan, you will typically put a pen in your pocket.
Now, we are also teaching them combat skills, of course, but I would argue, open-source security means connecting in ways that create longer lasting security effect.
Here's another example.
This is a US Navy warship.
But, you know, life is not an on-and-off switch.
You don't have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks.
I would argue life is a rheostat.
And the more puzzles you solve, the greater the chances that you'll win some prizes.
Now, why do you have to consume the tea?
Why? Because it makes a lot of sense: In order to solve these puzzles effectively, if you think about it, your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously, right?

It needs to be alert, for which caffeine is very good.
For example, very early on in the treatment, things are negative, the feedback, before things become positive.
Right? It can happen in the stock market.
Volatile stock market, getting negative feedback, it is also immediate.



So the best way of explaining it is to just show it.
What you can see over here is Tamara, who is holding my phone that's now plugged in.
So let me start with this.
Matt Mills: Now, what's great about this is, there's no trickery here.
There's nothing done to this image.
And what's great about this is the technology's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does.

3D models and place them in the world around me, so I have one over here.
Tamara, would you like to jump in?
MM: I should leap in.
On the emotional side, we have people who've done things like send postcards and Christmas cards back to their family with little messages on them.
We have people who have, for example, taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car and tagged up different components within an engine, so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more, you can point and discover the information.
We're all very, very familiar with the Internet.
We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging.
They're not something that's been established.
It's not something that's institutionalized.
One of the key issues was battery consumption and charging.
Luminosity was an issue, when you have too much bright sunlight outside.
Often the roofs are broken, so you don't have enough darkness in the classroom to do these things.
Vinay Venkatraman: Yeah. That's right. BG: Okay.
VV: So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works.
It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all.
Vinay Venkatraman: Yeah. That's right. BG: Okay.
VV: So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works.
It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all.
So ...  So I take it into the start position, and then I press the read button.  So it's taking a little reading from you.  And then the pointer goes and points to three different options.
Let's see what happens here.  Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually.
BG: Great. Good news.  VV: So ...  if the pointer, unfortunately, had pointed to the red spot, we would have to rush you to a hospital.
So essentially, the three things that are required to make this conversion from this guy to this guy is a cheap remote control for a television that you can almost find in every home today, some parts from a computer mouse, basically, something that you can scavenge for very low cost, and a few parts that have to be pre-programmed.
Basically this is a micro-controller with a few extra components that can be shipped for very little cost across the world, and that's what is all required with a little bit of local tinkering talent to convert the device into something else.
So we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the ASHA worker.

It was a machine that was designed long before anyone thought about computers.
If you know anything about the history of computers, you will know that in the '30s and the '40s, simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today, and you would be correct, except for you'd have the wrong century.
The first computer was really designed in the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s.
So let's talk about the memory. The memory is very like the memory of a computer today, except it was all made out of metal, stacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high.
Imagine a thing this high of cogs, hundreds and hundreds of them, and they've got numbers on them.
It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal.
The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic -- so addition, multiplication, subtraction, division -- which already is a bit of a feat in metal, but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator doesn't: this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision.
It could do the "if then" for basic programmers, and that fundamentally made it into a computer.
It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more.
Obviously, you've got a computer now.
You've got punch cards, a CPU and memory.
You need accessories you're going to come with.
This lady is the daughter of the mad, bad and dangerous-to-know Lord Byron, and her mother, being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of Lord Byron's madness and badness, thought, "I know the solution: Mathematics is the solution.
We'll teach her mathematics. That'll calm her down."
Because of course, there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy, so, you know, that'll be fine.  Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training, and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother, and Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine.
Rather than just being a programmer, she saw something that Babbage didn't.
Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics.
He was building a machine to do mathematics, and Lovelace said, "You could do more than mathematics on this machine." And just as you do, everyone in this room already's got a computer on them right now, because they've got a phone.

If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom.

If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom.
Whether it's video or text or music or voice, it's all numbers, it's all, underlying it, mathematical functions happening, and Lovelace said, "Just because you're doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn't mean these things can't represent other things in the real world, such as music."
Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective, but Turing told us something very important.
He laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science, and said, "It doesn't matter how you make a computer."
It doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical, like Babbage's was, or electronic, like computers are today, or perhaps in the future, cells, or, again, mechanical again, once we get into nanotechnology.
There is in a sense a computing essence.
This is called the Church–Turing thesis.
And so suddenly, you get this link where you say this thing Babbage had built really was a computer.
This is called the Church–Turing thesis.
And so suddenly, you get this link where you say this thing Babbage had built really was a computer.
In fact, it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers, only really slowly.  To give you an idea of how slowly, it had about 1k of memory.

It used punch cards, which were being fed in, and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.
So, where does that bring us today?
So there are plans.
Over in Swindon, the Science Museum archives, there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine.
The project has a number of parts to it.
One was the scanning of Babbage's archive.
That's been done. The second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build.
That's been done. The second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build.
The third part is a computer simulation of that machine, and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum.
When it's built, you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works, because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you, you've got to look at this humongous thing and say, "Ah, I see the memory operating, I see the CPU operating, I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating."  But in between that we're going to do a simulation.

Babbage himself wrote, he said, as soon as the analytical engine exists, it will surely guide the future course of science.

We're free to choose where we make the fold.
And by doing so, we can differentiate the surfaces.
Through this very simple process, we can create an astounding variety of forms.
But it was very labor intensive.
There's a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical.
It took me several months to design the column, but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces.
There are three paintings I'm going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them.
The first one needs little introduction -- "Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer, 17th-century Dutch painter.
This is the most glorious painting.

I first saw it when I was 19, and I immediately went out and got a poster of it, and in fact I still have that poster. 30 years later it's hanging in my house.
I like this version the best, because some of the boys are older and some are younger, and to me, this one, like Goldilocks's porridge, is just right.
He's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man.
He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience, and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.
He's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man.
He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience, and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.
And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.
He's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man.
He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience, and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.
And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.
And that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" -- we don't know if she's happy or sad.
I've written an entire novel about her, and I still don't know if she's happy or sad.
Again and again, back to the painting, looking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.
Again and again, back to the painting, looking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.
And we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily, but not really, and we come back again and again.
The last painting I'm going to talk about is called "Anonymous" by anonymous.  This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.
The last painting I'm going to talk about is called "Anonymous" by anonymous.  This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.
They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury, and then they discovered that it wasn't him, and they have no idea who it is.
Now, in the National Portrait Gallery, if you don't know the biography of the painting, it's kind of useless to you.
Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune?
You put all those together, and you've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.
Now, here's the story.
And perhaps a green roof in the future, when we're further utilizing urban areas, where there are stacks of garden spaces.
Check out this image above the orange line in Boston.
Try to spot the beehive. It's there.
What can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future?
Well, really, just change your perspective.
Try to understand that bees are very important.
Another project was built up to watch China and Chinese Internet.
And now, today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past several years, from that wall.
So, if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones, you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom.
Social media changed Chinese mindset.
More and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their birthright, not some imported American privilege.
But also, it gave the Chinese a national public sphere for people to, it's like a training of their citizenship, preparing for future democracy.
It's good to see you again.   Rob Legato: I pretend they're clapping for me.
So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can, and I'm basically recreating the launch with fire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threw in front of the lens to look like ice, and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you, what you were reacting to, what you're emoting to, is something that's a total falsehood, and I found that
really kind of fascinating.
It's totally make-believe, yet it's not to you, and I found that that was a very interesting thing to explore and use, and it caused me to create the next effect that I'll show you, which is this sort of magic transition, and all I was really attempting to do is basically have the audience cue the effect, so it became a seamless experience for them, that I wasn't showing you my sort of interpretation,
I was showing you what you wanted to see.
And the very next shot, right after this -- So you can see what I was doing.
Okay. So now the Titanic transition.
So this is what I was referring to where I wanted to basically magically transplant from one state of the Titanic to the other. So I'll just play the shot once.   And what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you.
Gloria Stuart: That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.
It was, incidentally, the last time I ever saw daylight.
It was a long film to work on.  Now, "Hugo" was another interesting movie, because the movie itself is about film illusions.
It's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a motion picture, and one of the things I had to do is, we — Sasha Baron Cohen is a very clever, very smart guy, comedian, wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of the Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things, and he wanted his leg brace to get caught on a moving train.
But we can ask the question, "But is it music?"
And I say this rhetorically, because of course by just about any standard we would have to concede that this is, of course, a piece of music, but I put this here now because, just to set it in your brains for the moment, because we're going to return to this question.
It's going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation.
So here we have this piece of music by Beethoven, and my problem with it is, it's boring.
I mean, you — I'm just like, a hush, huh -- It's like --  It's Beethoven, how can you say that?
No, well, I don't know, it's very familiar to me.
So that might be the kind of thing -- Why thank you.
That would be the kind of thing that I would do, and it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven.
In fact, I think it's not better than it. The thing is --  -- it's more interesting to me. It's less boring for me.
That would be the kind of thing that I would do, and it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven.
In fact, I think it's not better than it. The thing is --  -- it's more interesting to me. It's less boring for me.
I'm really leaning into me, because I, because I have to think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly as that Beethoven text is running in time through my head and I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations I'm going to make to it.

I'm really leaning into me, because I, because I have to think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly as that Beethoven text is running in time through my head and I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations I'm going to make to it.
So this is an engaging enterprise for me, and I've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there, and now my face appears twice, so I think we can agree that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise.  But it's an engaging one, and it's interesting to me for a while, but then I get bored with it, and by it, I actually mean, the piano, because it becomes, it's this familiar instrument, it's timbral range is actually
I took the Copenhagen subway map and I renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations, and the players, who are synchronized with stopwatches, follow the timetables, which are listed in minutes past the hour.
So this is a case of actually adapting something, or maybe stealing something, and then turning it into a musical notation.
Another adaptation would be this piece.
So, yeah, I get it, with, like, the weird appliances and then the total absence of conventional instruments and this glut of conductors, people might, you know, wonder, yeah, "Is this music?"
But let's move on to a piece where clearly I'm behaving myself, and that is my "Concerto for Orchestra."
You're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments in this clip.   This, in fact, is not the title of this piece.
There was the florist, and I can understand that, once again, we're putting pressure on the ontology of music as we know it conventionally, but let's look at one last piece today I'm going to share with you.
This is going to be a piece called "Aphasia," and it's for hand gestures synchronized to sound, and this invites yet another role, and final one I'll share with you, which is that of the choreographer.
And the score for the piece looks like this, and it instructs me, the performer, to make various hand gestures at very specific times synchronized with an audio tape, and that audio tape is made up exclusively of vocal samples.
But closer to home, we started installing these walls in schools that look like this with lighting like that, real LED stuff, 21st-century technology.
And what do you know? We made 21st century money, and that was groundbreaking. Wow!
This is my harvest, people.
I urge you to do something.
Right now, we're all tadpoles, but I urge you to become a big frog and take that big, green leap.
I don't care if you're on the left, on the right, up the middle, wherever.
There were a handful of positions left open from the standard admissions process, and the night before they were supposed to open that for registration, thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long, hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.
When the gates opened, there was a stampede, and 20 people were injured and one woman died.
She was a mother who gave her life trying to get her son a chance at a better life.
Since we opened the website in February, we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries.
We have 1.5 million enrollments, 6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched so far have been submitted, and 14 million videos have been viewed.
But it's not just about the numbers, it's also about the people.
Other students might be interested in a particular enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.
So this format allows us to break away from the one-size-fits-all model of education, and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum.
Of course, we all know as educators that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.
But when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer, it's kind of hard to miss.
So Andrew and his students went in, looked at some of those assignments, understood the root cause of the misconception, and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket, which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.
So this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers.
If we aren't going to be afraid of conflict, we have to see it as thinking, and then we have to get really good at it.
So, recently, I worked with an executive named Joe, and Joe worked for a medical device company.
And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on.
Open information is fantastic, open networks are essential.
But the truth won't set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it.
Openness isn't the end.

Don't worry about tunes. Take a tune, sing high when they sing low, sing fast when they sing slow, and you've got a new tune."
And that's, that's what Guthrie did right here, and I'm sure you all recognize the results.
Now, creative works may indeed be kind of like property, but it's property that we're all building on, and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared.
Henry Ford once said, "I invented nothing new.
I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work.
That's multi-touch, controlling a device by touching its display.
Here is Steve Jobs introducing multi-touch and making a rather foreboding joke.
Steve Jobs: And we have invented a new technology called multi-touch.
It used to look like this, and now it's more like this, with fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place.
We call it propaganda gardening.  Corner row railway, station car park, front of a health center, people's front gardens, and even in front of the police station.  We've got edible canal towpaths, and we've got sprouting cemeteries.
The soil is extremely good.  We've even invented a new form of tourism.
We're starting to build resilience ourselves.
We're starting to reinvent community ourselves, and we've done it all without a flipping strategy document.
And here's the thing as well.
That means I need to know how I tick, when I collapse, where my formidable points are, where my weaker points are.
When do I give in?
What will I stand up for?
They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns.
And she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers were more scared than the student protesters behind her.
But she told the students to sit down.
But we have to practice.
So what about our fear?
I have a little mantra.
So what about our fear?
I have a little mantra.
My fear grows fat on the energy I feed it.
The only thing to do is to get up, make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you.
You're the adult.
The fear is the child.
The only thing to do is to get up, make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you.
You're the adult.
The fear is the child.
I got up, made the cup of tea, sat down with it, did it all and I'm here -- still partly paralyzed, but I'm here.
So that's fear. What about anger?
Wherever there is injustice there's anger.


The story starts: I was at a friend's house, and she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual, which is the manual of mental disorders.

It lists every known mental disorder.

And it used to be, back in the '50s, a very slim pamphlet.
And I've got malingering.
And I think it's actually quite rare to have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder, because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious.
Anyway, I was looking through this book, wondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was, or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you're not a trained professional, or maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire to label what's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder.

I didn't know which of these was true, but I thought it was kind of interesting, and I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view, which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists.
He said, "That's leadership."
And I said, "Shallow affect, an inability to experience a range of emotions."
He said, "Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions?"
We flew into a town that had a static, outdated website and a frenetic Facebook feed, trying to structure the response, and we launched our platform.
All of the interest came in the first four days, but by the time they lost the news cycle, that's when the needs came in, yet they had this massive resource of what people were able to give and they've been able to meet the needs of their residents.
CO: So it's working, but it could be better.
Emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient.
Imagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place before a disaster.
So that's what we're working on.
And the answer, I think, can be found in things like this.
This is the cover of "Philosophical Transactions," the first scientific journal ever published in English in the middle of the 1600s, and it was created by a group of people who had been calling themselves "The Invisible College," a group of natural philosophers who only later would call themselves scientists, and they wanted to improve the way natural philosophers argued with each other, and they needed to do two things for this.
They needed openness. They needed to create a norm which said, when you do an experiment, you have to publish not just your claims, but how you did the experiment.
If you don't tell us how you did it, we won't trust you.
But the other thing they needed was speed.
They had to quickly synchronize what other natural philosophers knew. Otherwise, you couldn't get the right kind of argument going.
The printing press was clearly the right medium for this, but the book was the wrong tool. It was too slow.
And so they invented the scientific journal as a way of synchronizing the argument across the community of natural scientists.
The scientific revolution wasn't created by the printing press.
Once you get more than one person writing it, it's very easy for any two programmers to overwrite each other's work if they're working on the same file, or to send incompatible instructions that simply causes the computer to choke, and this problem grows larger the more programmers are involved.
To a first approximation, the problem of managing a large software project is the problem of keeping this social chaos at bay.
Now, for decades there has been a canonical solution to this problem, which is to use something called a "version control system," and a version control system does what is says on the tin.

This is a tremendously complicated program, and yet, for years, Torvalds ran this not with automated tools but out of his email box.
People would literally mail him changes that they'd agreed on, and he would merge them by hand.
And then, 15 years after looking at Linux and figuring out how the community worked, he said, "I think I know how to write a version control system for free people."

You can go and pick your Senator and then you can see a list of bills they have sponsored.
Someone going by Divegeek has put up the Utah code, the laws of the state of Utah, and they've put it up there not just to distribute the code, but with the very interesting possibility that this could be used to further the development of legislation.
Somebody put up a tool during the copyright debate last year in the Senate, saying, "It's strange that Hollywood has more access to Canadian legislators than Canadian citizens do. Why don't we use GitHub to show them what a citizen-developed bill might look like?"

And it includes this very evocative screenshot.
This is a called a "diff," this thing on the right here.
And it was the birth of the global world.
And you have the Internet.
And this is not the audience to which I'm going to preach to what extent the Internet empowered people.
I mean, I was a beautiful baby.
Here's me and my dad a couple days after I was born.
So in the world of product design, the beautiful baby's like the concept car.
Here's me and my dad a couple days after I was born.
So in the world of product design, the beautiful baby's like the concept car.
It's the knockout.
Here's the bad news: the only baby ever actually put inside the NeoNurture incubator was this kid during a Time magazine photo shoot.
So recognition is fantastic.
We want design to get out for people to see it.
But it felt like a booby prize.
We wanted to make beautiful things that are going to make the world a better place, and I don't think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm.
So it turns out that design for inspiration doesn't really ...
So it turns out that in emerging markets -- where the fish are -- are the emerging middle class of these countries -- diseases of affluence: heart disease, infertility.
So it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution.
OK, that was an important lesson.
And they said, "Let's work on newborn jaundice."
So this is another one of these mind-boggling global problems.
Jaundice affects two-thirds of newborns around the world.
There's one way to treat jaundice, and that's what's called an exchange transfusion.
So as you can imagine, that's expensive and a little bit dangerous.
There is another cure.
Turns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like.
They want Buck Rogers, they don't want effective.
It sounds crazy, it sounds dumb, but there are actually hospitals who would rather have no equipment than something that looks cheap and crummy.
Our goal is to study how they work, the resources they have access to, so that they can make this product.
So that's the design for manufacture question.
When we think about actual use, you'll notice that Firefly has a single bassinet.
When we think about actual use, you'll notice that Firefly has a single bassinet.
It only fits a single baby, and the idea here is it's obvious how you ought to use this device.
If you try to put more than one kid in, you're stacking them on top of each other.
So close your eyes for a minute.
Here we are, in a space, the subjective, collective space of the darkness of the body.
I think of this as the place of imagination, of potential, but what are its qualities?
Here we are, in a space, the subjective, collective space of the darkness of the body.

It is objectless. There are no things in it.
I think of this as the place of imagination, of potential, but what are its qualities?
It is objectless. There are no things in it.
It is dimensionless. It is limitless.
Can we use, in a way, a body as an empty catalyst for a kind of empathy with the experience of space-time as it is lived, as I am standing here in front of you trying to feel and make a connection in this space-time that we are sharing, can we use, at it were, the memory of a body, of a human space in space to catalyze an experience, again, firsthand experience,
of elemental time.
Human time, industrial time, tested against the time of the tides, in which these memories of a particular body, that could be any body, multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction, many times, placed over three square miles, a mile out to sea, disappearing, in different conditions of day and night.
The last work that I just wanted to share with you is "Blind Light," which is perhaps the most open work, and in a conference of radical openness, I think maybe this is as radical as I get, using light and water vapor as my materials.
Here is a box filled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure, with a cloud and with very bright light.
As you walk towards the ever-open threshold, you disappear, both to yourselves and to others.


Sydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney.
For a few days, they transformed a massive city into a community where endless possibility reigned.
The Guardian wrote, "If art is about transformation, then there can be no more transformative experience.
What 'The Sultan's Elephant' represents is no less than an artistic occupation of the city and a reclamation of the streets for the people."
The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor.
About a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min, she invited me home to her family village for the Chinese New Year.
On the train home, she gave me a present: a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.
And this is a global business.
Ogandiro smokes fish in Makoko in Lagos, and I asked her, "Where does the fish come from?"
And I thought she'd say, "Oh, you know, up the lagoon somewhere, or maybe across Africa," but you'll be happy to know she said it came from here, it comes from the North Sea.
And they went back to the drawing board, and they retooled, and they came up with another plan: We don't sell you the phone, we don't sell you the monthly plan.
We only sell you airtime.
And where's the airtime sold?
Cooperative development is a way forward.
Secondly, from the [Austrian] anarchist philosopher Paul Feyerabend, facts are relative, and what is a massive right of self-reliance to a Nigerian businessperson is considered unauthorized and horrible to other people, and we have to recognize that there are differences in how people define things and what their facts are.
And third is, and I'm taking this from the great American beat poet Allen Ginsberg, that alternate economies barter and different kinds of currency, alternate currencies are also very important, and he talked about buying what he needed just with his good looks.
And anyways, isn't it supposed to be man versus machine?
Instead, it's about cooperation, and the right type of cooperation.
We've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years.
Instead, it's about cooperation, and the right type of cooperation.
We've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years.
It's a sexy vision, for sure. Many have embraced it.
And importantly, we need to reallocate the few specialists who are available to perform roles such as capacity-building and supervision.
Now for me, task shifting is an idea with truly global significance, because even though it has arisen out of the situation of the lack of resources that you find in developing countries, I think it has a lot of significance for better-resourced countries as well. Why is that?
Well, in part, because health care in the developed world, the health care costs in the [developed] world, are rapidly spiraling out of control, and a huge chunk of those costs are human resource costs.

But equally important is because health care has become so incredibly professionalized that it's become very remote and removed from local communities.

He wanted to shake the President's hand.
The President dismissed the Secretary of State, whom he was conferring with, and asked the dentist if he would remove a tooth.
Later, in the 1850s, under President Pierce, he was known to have remarked — probably the only thing he's known for — when a neighbor passed by and said, "I'd love to see the beautiful house," and Pierce said to him, "Why my dear sir, of course you may come in.
We've heard talk here at TED about people biohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino, and Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting young people to build websites and make videos.
When we start by teaching young people that we live, not in a passive society, a read-only society, but in a writable society, where we have the power to change our communities, to change our institutions, that's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway towards this open government innovation, towards this open government movement, towards this open government revolution.
So let me close by saying that I think the important thing for us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution.
You needed easy access to the fields.
And for hundreds, even thousands of years, the home was really the center of life.
Life was very small for most people.
You don't need reverse. You don't need parallel parking.
You just spin and go directly in.  So we've been working with a company to commercialize this.
My PhD student Ryan Chin presented these early ideas two years ago at a TEDx conference.

We can combine shared use and folding and autonomy and we get something like 28 times the land utilization with that kind of strategy.
One of our graduate students then says, well, how does a driverless car communicate with pedestrians?
You have nobody to make eye contact with.
That's our challenge.
This is an early design for this little three-wheel.
It's an electronic bike.

The murder happened a little over 21 years ago, January the 18th, 1991, in a small bedroom community of Lynwood, California, just a few miles southeast of Los Angeles.
A father came out of his house to tell his teenage son and his five friends that it was time for them to stop horsing around on the front lawn and on the sidewalk, to get home, finish their schoolwork, and prepare themselves for bed.
A shocker in American jurisprudence.
So in fact, we found the same identical conditions, we reconstructed the entire thing again, he came out with an entire brigade of sheriff's officers to protect him in this community, all right?  We had him stand actually slightly in the street, so closer to the suspect vehicle, the shooter vehicle, than the actual teenagers were, so he stood a few feet from the curb toward the middle of the street.
We had a car that came by, same identical car as described by the teenagers, right?
I couldn't see the slightest bend of his head.
I had no sense of how he was reacting to this, and after he looked at this reenactment, he turned to me and he says, "Is there anything else you want me to look at?"
I said, "Your honor," and I don't know whether I was emboldened by the scientific measurements that I had in my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate, or whether it was just sheer stupidity, which is what the defense lawyers thought —  — when they heard me say, "Yes, Your Honor, I want you stand right there and I want the car to go around the block again

and I want it to come and I want it to stop right in front of you, three to four feet away, and I want the passenger to extend his hand with a black object and point it right at you, and you can look at it as long as you want."
and many of our treatments, and so we knew that to really accelerate cures and therapies, we were going to have to address this with two things: new technologies and also a new research model.
Because if you don't close that gap, you really are exactly where we are today.
And that's what I want to focus on.
In 1998, human embryonic stem cells were first identified, and just nine years later, a group of scientists in Japan were able to take skin cells and reprogram them with very powerful viruses to create a kind of pluripotent stem cell called an induced pluripotent stem cell, or what we refer to as an IPS cell.
This was really an extraordinary advance, because although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells, which still remain the gold standard, they are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery.
So a few months later, in 2008, one of our scientists built on that research. He took skin biopsies, this time from people who had a disease, ALS, or as you call it in the U.K., motor neuron disease. He turned them into the IPS cells that I've just told you about, and then he turned those IPS cells into the motor neurons that actually were dying in the disease.
So the way we develop drugs now is by testing promising compounds on -- We didn't have disease modeling with human cells, so we'd been testing them on cells of mice or other creatures or cells that we engineer, but they don't have the characteristics of the diseases that we're actually trying to cure.
You know, we're not mice, and you can't go into a living person with an illness and just pull out a few brain cells or cardiac cells and then start fooling around in a lab to test for, you know, a promising drug.
But what you can do with human stem cells, now, is actually create avatars, and you can create the cells, whether it's the live motor neurons or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells or other kinds of cells, and you can test for drugs, promising compounds, on the actual cells that you're trying to affect, and this is now, and it's absolutely extraordinary, and you're going to know at the beginning,
But what you can do with human stem cells, now, is actually create avatars, and you can create the cells, whether it's the live motor neurons or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells or other kinds of cells, and you can test for drugs, promising compounds, on the actual cells that you're trying to affect, and this is now, and it's absolutely extraordinary, and you're going to know at the beginning,
the very early stages of doing your assay development and your testing, you're not going to have to wait 13 years until you've brought a drug to market, only to find out that actually it doesn't work, or even worse, harms people.
But it isn't really enough just to look at the cells from a few people or a small group of people, because we have to step back. We've got to look at the big picture.
It has the capacity to produce thousands and thousands of stem cell lines. It's genetically arrayed.
It has massively parallel processing capability, and it's going to change the way drugs are discovered, we hope, and I think eventually what's going to happen is that we're going to want to re-screen drugs, on arrays like this, that already exist, all of the drugs that currently exist, and in the future, you're going to be taking drugs and treatments that have been tested for side effects on all of the relevant cells,
on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells.
In the past decade or so, mainly due to advances in brain imaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, neuroscientists have started to look inside the living human brain of all ages, and to track changes in brain structure and brain function, so we use structural MRI if you'd like to take a snapshot, a photograph, at really high resolution of the inside of the living human brain, and we can ask questions like,
how much gray matter does the brain contain, and how does that change with age?
And we also use functional MRI, called fMRI, to take a video, a movie, of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something.
It can go on a long time.  One of the brain regions that changes most dramatically during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex.
So this is a model of the human brain, and this is prefrontal cortex, right at the front.
Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.
So this is a model of the human brain, and this is prefrontal cortex, right at the front.
Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.
It's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species, and it's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions, things like decision-making, planning, planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year, inhibiting inappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid.
when there's no director present, when they just have to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background.
Developmentally, these two conditions develop in exactly the same way. Between late childhood and mid-adolescence, there's an improvement, in other words a reduction of errors, in both of these trials, in both of these conditions.
But it's when you compare the last two groups, the mid-adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting, because there, there is no continued improvement in the no-director condition.
So for example, take risk-taking. We know that adolescents have a tendency to take risks. They do.
They take more risks than children or adults, and they are particularly prone to taking risks when they're with their friends. There's an important drive to become independent from one's parents and to impress one's friends in adolescence.
But now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system, so I'm going to show you the limbic system in red in the slide behind me, and also on this brain.

So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain, and it's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things, including taking risks.
Julian Treasure: What a difference.
Now that education you would receive, and thanks to the British acoustician Adrian James for those simulations. The signal was the same, the background noise was the same.
All that changed was the acoustics of the classroom in those two examples.
We're talking about good, fresh food that is being wasted on a colossal scale.
Eventually, I set about writing my book, really to demonstrate the extent of this problem on a global scale. What this shows is a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level of food waste in each country in the world.
Unfortunately, empirical data, good, hard stats, don't exist, and therefore to prove my point, I first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted.
Liver, lungs, heads, tails, kidneys, testicles, all of these things which are traditional, delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste. Offal consumption has halved in Britain and America in the last 30 years.
As a result, this stuff gets fed to dogs at best, or is incinerated.
This man, in Kashgar, Xinjiang province, in Western China, is serving up his national dish.

It's called sheep's organs.
At the moment, Europe depends on importing millions of tons of soy from South America, where its production contributes to global warming, to deforestation, to biodiversity loss, to feed livestock here in Europe.
At the same time we throw away millions of tons of food waste which we could and should be feeding them.
If we did that, and fed it to pigs, we would save that amount of carbon.
And one of the side effects of having major massive blood loss is you get tunnel vision, so I remember being on the stretcher and having a little nickel-sized cone of vision, and I was moving my head around and we got to St. Vincent's, and we're racing down this hallway, and I see the lights going, and it's a peculiar effect of memories like that.
They don't really go to the usual place that memories go.
They kind of have this vault where they're stored in high-def, and George Lucas did all the sound effects.  So sometimes, remembering them, it's like, it's not like any other kind of memories.
As with the Arab Spring, during the recent elections in the Congo, voters were able to send text messages of local polling stations to the headquarters in the capital, Kinshasa.
And in the wake of the result, the diaspora has joined with the Carter Center, the Catholic Church and other observers, to draw attention to the undemocratic result.
The mobile phone has given people around the world an important tool towards gaining their political freedom.

Where does it come from?
You know, if you're working with a pathogen, you're not part of the biohacker community, you're part of the bioterrorist community, I'm sorry.
And sometimes people ask me, "Well, what about an accident?"
Well, working with the safe organisms that we normally work with, the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating, like, some sort of superbug, that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the Sahara Desert.
Some people ask me, well, why am I involved?
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science.
The thing is, there's something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can't find anywhere else.

There's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project, and you don't have to justify to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money, that it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible.
This lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President of the United States.
Here comes the Prime Minister -- No.     Amy Cuddy: So a handshake, or the lack of a handshake, can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks.
Even the BBC and The New York Times.

And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language.
And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote, who we ask out on a date.
For example, Nalini Ambady, a researcher at Tufts University, shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions, their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued.
You're looking at your notes, you're hunching up, making yourself small, when really what you should be doing maybe is this, like, in the bathroom, right? Do that. Find two minutes.
So that's what we want to test. Okay?
So we bring people into a lab, and they do either high- or low-power poses again, they go through a very stressful job interview.
But what's driving it? It's not about the content of the speech.
It's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech.
Because we rate them on all these variables related to competence, like, how well-structured is the speech?
The Minecraft community went bananas over this project, and Ben became an instant media celebrity.
And indeed, for quite a few people, taking this NAND2Tetris pilgrimage, if you will, has turned into a life-changing experience.
For example, take Dan Rounds, who is a music and math major from East Lansing, Michigan.
They are doing it because of one motivation only.
They have a tremendous passion to learn.
And with that in mind, I'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading.
The driving force behind this project is my colleague Shmulik London, and, you see, just like Salman did about 90 years ago, the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people, because at the end, it's all about people.
And a few years ago, I was walking in Tel Aviv and I saw this graffiti on a wall, and I found it so compelling that by now I preach it to my students, and I'd like to try to preach it to you.
Now, I don't know how many people here are familiar with the term "mensch."
It's a room broken in two halves.
I've turned the computer on, and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard, and it's put into the computer.
And the floppy disk drive person wears it.  She finds the first sector on the disk, and takes data off the disk and passes it off to, of course, the bus.
And it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn't the computer respond to sound?
So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time.
And then I spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this, and I stopped doing it because my students at MIT got so much better than myself, so I had to hang up my mouse.

But in '96, I made my last piece. It was in black and white, monochrome, fully monochrome, all in integer mathematics.
So that was 20 years ago, and I was always on the periphery of art.
By being President of RISD I've gone deep into art, and art is a wonderful thing, fine art, pure art.
You know, when people say, "I don't get art.
By being President of RISD I've gone deep into art, and art is a wonderful thing, fine art, pure art.
You know, when people say, "I don't get art.
I don't get it at all." That means art is working, you know?
I don't get it at all." That means art is working, you know?
It's like, art is supposed to be enigmatic, so when you say, like, "I don't get it," like, oh, that's great.  Art does that, because art is about asking questions, questions that may not be answerable.
At RISD, we have this amazing facility called the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has 80,000 samples of animal, bone, mineral, plants.
At RISD, we have this amazing facility called the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has 80,000 samples of animal, bone, mineral, plants.
You know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road, they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it.
And why do we have this facility?
At RISD, you're not allowed to draw from an image.
And many people ask me, John, couldn't you just digitize all this? Make it all digital? Wouldn't it be better?
And I often say, well, there's something good to how things used to be done. There's something very different about it, something we should figure out what is good about how we did it, even in this new era.
And I often say, well, there's something good to how things used to be done. There's something very different about it, something we should figure out what is good about how we did it, even in this new era.
And I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named Tota Hasegawa. He's based in London, no, actually it's in Tokyo, but when he was based in London, he had a game with his wife. He would go to antique shops, and the game was as such: When we look at an antique we want, we'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique, and if it's a good story, we'll buy it.
So they'd go to an antique shop, and they'd look at this cup, and they'd say, "Tell us about this cup."
We aren't functioning so easily anymore.
We aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore.
As an example of authoritarianism, I was in Russia one time traveling in St. Petersburg, at a national monument, and I saw this sign that says, "Do Not Walk On The Grass," and I thought, oh, I mean, I speak English, and you're trying to single me out. That's not fair.
My favorite ones are "no plants." Why would you bring a plant to a national monument? I'm not sure.
And also "no love."  So that is authoritarianism.
And what is that, structurally?
Now this is a concept that I'm currently researching and writing my next book on, and currently define as the worth of your reputation, your intentions, capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces.
This isn't some far-off frontier.
There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me and Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation.
A three-digit score, your traditional credit history, that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is, will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost, what we can access, and, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world.
Indeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century.
Reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me.
Then you have to update your model based on the signals coming back, and you have to do something that is interesting, which is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay.
That is, you have to decide what that other person expects of you.
You have to send signals to manage your image in their mind.
We can compute that during the game.
And we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior.
Here's the cool thing. Six or seven years ago, we developed a team. It was at the time in Houston, Texas.
And we see that it cratered during the Great Recession, and it hasn't started to bounce back at all.
But the story is not just a recession story.
The decade that we've just been through had relatively anemic job growth all throughout, especially when we compare it to other decades, and the 2000s are the only time we have on record where there were fewer people working at the end of the decade than at the beginning. This is not what you want to see.
What happened instead is he very carefully documented what happens over and over again when technology comes for the first time to an environment and a community: the lives of people, the welfares of people, improve dramatically.
So as I look around at all the evidence and I think about the room that we have ahead of us, I become a huge digital optimist and I start to think that this wonderful statement from the physicist Freeman Dyson is actually not hyperbole.
This is an accurate assessment of what's going on.
Forty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable.
And they say in their discussion that this is very likely because freaks get published.
People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies, and the occasions when it works they will publish, and the ones where it doesn't work they won't.
Unfortunately, over the course of the next five, 10 years, other companies had the same idea about drugs that would prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks.
These drugs were brought to market. They were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing, and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal, over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs.
Now actually, in 1993, the researchers who did that 1980 study, that early study, published a mea culpa, an apology to the scientific community, in which they said, "When we carried out our study in 1980, we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance."
These are stories from 20, 30 years ago.
The academic publishing environment is very different now.
There are academic journals like "Trials," the open access journal, which will publish any trial conducted in humans regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result.


I've always written primarily about architecture, about buildings, and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions.
And then this happened.
My Internet broke one day, as it occasionally does, and the cable guy came to fix it, and he started with the dusty clump of cables behind the couch, and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard, and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall.
And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire, and he said, "There's your problem.

And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire, and he said, "There's your problem.
A squirrel is chewing on your Internet."  And this seemed astounding. The Internet is a transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions.
And the answer, by all accounts, was no.
This was the Internet, this black box with a red light on it, as represented in the sitcom "The IT Crowd."
Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben, because that's where you get the best reception, but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation.
The elders of the Internet were willing to part with it for a short while, and she looks at it and she says, "This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?"
They say, "Of course not, the Internet doesn't weigh anything."
And I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for.
And in this dimension, they are incredibly small.
You can you hold them in your hand. They're like a garden hose.
But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive, as expansive as you can imagine.
This is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland.
And the landscape is changing. Three years ago, when I started thinking about this, there was one cable down the Western coast of Africa, represented in this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.
Now there are six cables and more coming, three down each coast.
And Simon was working on a new cable, WACS, the West Africa Cable System, that stretched from Lisbon down the west coast of Africa, to Cote d'Ivoire, to Ghana, to Nigeria, to Cameroon.
And he said there was coming soon, depending on the weather, but he'd let me know when, and so with about four days notice, he said to go to this beach south of Lisbon, and a little after 9, this guy will walk out of the water.  And he'll be carrying a green nylon line, a lightweight line, called a messenger line, and that was the first link between sea and land, this link that would then be
leveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.
leveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.
Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship, and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place.
Then you can see the English engineers looking on.
and then he lit a cigarette.  And then once that cable was on shore, they began to prepare to connect it to the other side, for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station.
And first they got it with a hacksaw, and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a -- sort of working like chefs, and then finally they're working like jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down, and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together.
And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw, you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud.
And after a few moments, her therapist tries a new tack, and they start singing together, and Gabby starts to sing through her tears, and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels, and she sings, in one descending scale, she sings, "Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine."
And it's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail, in this case literally speak.
Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug, one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard, and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy, which has become very popular in music therapy now.
I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes, these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, or with children with disfiguring cancers.
I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor, that doctor without borders.
On the other hand, I had played the violin my entire life.
I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor, that doctor without borders.
On the other hand, I had played the violin my entire life.
Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession.
"How was it for you making that decision?"
And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to, and that for me, medical school could wait, but that the violin simply would not.
And after two more years of studying music, I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta.  And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic.

When I was considering a career in the art world, I took a course in London, and one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian called Pietro, who drank too much, smoked too much and swore much too much.
But he was a passionate teacher, and I remember one of our earlier classes with him, he was projecting images on the wall, asking us to think about them, and he put up an image of a painting.
And for me as a curator, I felt proud. I felt I'd shifted the needle a little.
Through this experience that could only be created in a museum, I'd opened up the eyes of my audience -- historians, artists, press, the general public -- to the beauty of this lost medium.
A few years later, I was invited to be the director of the museum, and after I got over that -- "Who, me? The tapestry geek? I don't wear a tie!" -- I realized the fact: I believe passionately in that curated museum experience.
In fact, we ripped down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings, a recreation of his first studio, a hall of mirrors, a curiosity box, a sunken ship, a burned-out interior, with videos and soundtracks that ranged from operatic arias to pigs fornicating.
And in this extraordinary setting, the costumes were like actors and actresses, or living sculptures.
It could have been a train wreck.
Now, in our galleries, we show 14 centuries of the development of different Islamic cultures across a vast geographic spread, and, again, hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last October.
I'm often asked, "Is digital media replacing the museum?"
and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge advocate of the Web.
And they use it as a metaphor. Have you come across this?
And they think it's a metaphor, but this is not a metaphor.
It's reality. As a young engineering student, I remember going to a demonstration where they basically, the demonstrator did something quite intriguing.
Okay? So I'll write the word "tap." Is that okay? It's a tap.  Okay, so he attaches it to a transparent pipe, and he turns the water on.
And he says, do you notice anything? And the water is whooshing down this pipe.
I mean, this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me?
So the water goes up. He turns it back down. Great.
And he says, "Anything you notice?" No. Then he sticks a needle into the pipe, and he connects this to a container, and he fills the container up with green ink. You with me?
So guess what happens? A thin green line comes out as it flows down the pipe. It's not that interesting.
And then he turns the water up a bit, so it starts coming back in. And nothing changes.
So he's changing the flow of the water, but it's just a boring green line.
He adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens.
He adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens.
There's this little flicker, and then as he turns it ever so slightly more, the whole of that green line disappears, and instead there are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle.
They're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink so that it actually gets diluted out, and the color's gone.

To understand the world that live in, we tell stories.
And while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it, all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online.

But video has been left out. It arrived on the web in a small box, and there it has remained, completely disconnected from the data and the content all around it.
In fact, in over a decade on the web, the only thing that has changed about video is the size of the box and the quality of the picture.
Popcorn changes all of that.
Let's go to this Google Map, and I'll show you how you can edit it.
All you do, go into the timeline, double-click the item, and I've set it to Toronto, because that's where I'm from.
Let's set it to something else.
The map shows each and every station, each and every station name, and I'm also displaying side streets.
In fact, most of the side streets even with their name, and for good measure, also a couple of landmarks, some of them signified by little symbols, others by these isometric three-dimensional bird's-eye-view drawings.
The map is relatively small in overall size, so something that you could still hold as a fold-out map or display in a reasonably-sized display box on a bus shelter.
But we all know in here, you know, there is no Devil, there are no voices in your head.
You know that when you have those abusive voices, all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic "I want to kill myself" kind of chemical, and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape, you might have yourself depression.
Oh, and that's not even the tip of the iceberg.
There is some good news. First of all, let me say, we've come a long, long way.
We started off as a teeny, teeny little one-celled amoeba, tiny, just sticking onto a rock, and now, voila, the brain.
Here we go.  This little baby has a lot of horsepower.
We most certainly do talk to terrorists, no question about it.
We are at war with a new form of terrorism.
It's sort of the good old, traditional form of terrorism, but it's sort of been packaged for the 21st century.
Terrorists have actually adapted to it.
It's something we have to, too, and that means the people who are working on counterterrorism responses have to start, in effect, putting on their Google-tinted glasses, or whatever.
For my part, what I wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand, say, Coca-Cola.

Both are fairly bad for your health.  If you look at it as a brand in those ways, what you'll come to realize is, it's a pretty flawed product.

As we've said, it's pretty bad for your health, it's bad for those who it affects, and it's not actually good if you're a suicide bomber either.
You're not really going to get 72 virgins in heaven.
It's not going to happen, I don't think.
And you're not really going to, in the '80s, end capitalism by supporting one of these groups. It's a load of nonsense.
And you're not really going to, in the '80s, end capitalism by supporting one of these groups. It's a load of nonsense.
But what you realize, it's got an Achilles' heel.
The brand has an Achilles' heel.
Perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across.
We've got to reveal the dangers in the product.
Our target audience, it's not just the producers of terrorism, as I've said, the terrorists.
We've got to practice what we preach.
But when it comes to knocking the brand, if the terrorists are Coca-Cola and we're Pepsi, I don't think, being Pepsi, anything we say about Coca-Cola, anyone's going to believe us.
So we've got to find a different mechanism, and one of the best mechanisms I've ever come across is the victims of terrorism.

They are somebody who can actually stand there and say, "This product's crap. I had it and I was sick for days.
The question "why?" is one of the most dangerous things you can do, because it takes you into uncertainty.
And yet, the irony is, the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space.
So how can we ever do anything new? Well fortunately, evolution has given us an answer, right?
It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin, or what extends beyond the universe, but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space.
So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty?
It's play.
We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color, but to a certain color flower only when it's in a certain pattern.
They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue, or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow.
Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle. The interesting question is, which?

What was really exciting about this project was we, and Beau, had no idea whether it would work.
It was completely new, and no one had done it before, including adults.  BL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers.
It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing, because that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day -- so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was the collaborator on this project. Okay?
Methods, what did you do? Results, what was the observation?
And the discussion is, who cares? Right?
That's a science paper, basically.  So the kids give me the words, right? I put it into a narrative, which means that this paper is written in kidspeak.

So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there.
All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old.
The first author is Blackawton Primary School, because if it were ever referenced, it would be "Blackawton et al," and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal, and it says this. It said many things, but it said this.

"and it certainly deserves wide exposure."
Larry Maloney, expert in vision, says, "The paper is magnificent.
The work would be publishable if done by adults."
Audience:     Brilliant. Now, open your eyes. We'll do it one more time.
Everyone over there shout.  Where's the sound coming from?   Thank you very much.  What's the point? The point is what science does for us.
Right? We normally walk through life responding, but if we ever want to do anything different, we have to step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes, he was able to see the world in a new way.
That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play, right?
Now, true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice, so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story.
So, Amy?
There is a lot of varnish still sitting there, several retouches, and some over cleaning. It becomes very visible.
But also, technology has helped to write new pages of our history, or at least to update pages of our histories.
For example, the "Lady with the Unicorn," another painting by Rafael, well, you see the unicorn.

I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are, how globalized we aren't, and why it's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of assessments.
And the leading point of view on this, whether measured by number of books sold, mentions in media, or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization, is this view that national borders really don't matter very much anymore, cross-border integration is close to complete, and we live in one world.


Once upon a time, the world was a big, dysfunctional family.
That was not my intention. I was just making these requests as part of research for my first book.
But it ended up in this very long, protracted legal battle and there I was after five years fighting against Parliament in front of three of Britain's most eminent High Court judges waiting for their ruling about whether or not Parliament had to release this data.
And I've got to tell you, I wasn't that hopeful, because I'd seen the establishment. I thought, it always sticks together. I am out of luck.
of revelations, everything from porn movies and bath plugs and new kitchens and mortgages that had never been paid off.
The end result was six ministers resigned, the first speaker of the house in 300 years was forced to resign, a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency, 120 MPs stepped down at that election, and so far, four MPs and two lords have done jail time for fraud.
So, thank you.  Well, I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain.
It was an example of a culture clash that's happening all over the world between bewigged and bestockinged officials who think that they can rule over us without very much prying from the public, and then suddenly confronted with a public who is no longer content with that arrangement, and not only not content with it, now, more often, armed with official data itself.
So we are moving to this democratization of information, and I've been in this field for quite a while.
Slightly embarrassing admission: Even when I was a kid, I used to have these little spy books, and I would, like, see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down.
So I've told you a bit about what I did to try and drag Parliament, kicking and screaming, into the 21st century, and I'm just going to give you a couple of examples of what a few other people I know are doing.
So this is a guy called Seb Bacon. He's a computer programmer, and he built a site called Alaveteli, and what it is, it's a Freedom of Information platform.
It's open-source, with documentation, and it allows you to make a Freedom of Information request, to ask your public body a question, so it takes all the hassle out of it, and I can tell you that there is a lot of hassle making these requests, so it takes all of that hassle out, and you just type in your question, for example, how many police officers have a criminal record?
Well, is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare?
Some fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't.
I think we've all read the Grimms' fairy tales, which are, indeed, very grim.
Some fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't.
I think we've all read the Grimms' fairy tales, which are, indeed, very grim.
But the world isn't a fairy tale, and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge.

Most remote community, I have never met a villager who does not want a vote.
So we need to acknowledge that despite the dubious statistics, despite the fact that 84 percent of people in Britain feel politics is broken, despite the fact that when I was in Iraq, we did an opinion poll in 2003 and asked people what political systems they preferred, and the answer came back that seven percent wanted the United States, five percent wanted France, three percent wanted Britain, and nearly 40 percent wanted Dubai, which is, after all,
not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous minor monarchy, democracy is a thing of value for which we should be fighting. But in order to do so we need to get away from instrumental arguments.
We need to get away from saying democracy matters because of the other things it brings.
We need to get away from feeling, in the same way, human rights matters because of the other things it brings, or women's rights matters for the other things it brings.
Why should we get away from those arguments?
Because they're very dangerous. If we set about saying, for example, torture is wrong because it doesn't extract good information, or we say, you need women's rights because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force, you leave yourself open to the position where the government of North Korea can turn around and say, "Well actually, we're having a lot of success extracting good information with our torture at the moment,"
or the government of Saudi Arabia to say, "Well, our economic growth's okay, thank you very much, considerably better than yours, so maybe we don't need to go ahead with this program on women's rights."
The point about democracy is not instrumental.

Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity, the dignity of the individual, the idea that each individual should have an equal vote, an equal say, in the formation of their government.

But if we're really to make democracy vigorous again, if we're ready to revivify it, we need to get involved in a new project of the citizens and the politicians.
Democracy is not simply a question of structures.
Pip from "Great Expectations" was adopted; Superman was a foster child; Cinderella was a foster child; Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, was fostered and institutionalized; Batman was orphaned; Lyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's "Northern Lights" was fostered; Jane Eyre, adopted; Roald Dahl's James from "James and the Giant Peach;" Matilda; Moses -- Moses!  Moses!  -- the boys in Michael Morpurgo's "Friend or Foe;"
Alem in Benjamin Zephaniah's "Refugee Boy;" Luke Skywalker -- Luke Skywalker!  -- Oliver Twist; Cassia in "The Concubine of Shanghai" by Hong Ying; Celie in Alice Walker's "The Color Purple."
All of these great fictional characters, all of them who were hurt by their condition, all of them who spawned thousands of other books and other films, all of them were fostered, adopted or orphaned.
It's not that I'd had the rug pulled from beneath me as much as the entire floor had been taken away.
When I got to the — For the next four, five years, I was held in four different children's homes.
On the third children's home, at 15, I started to rebel, and what I did was, I got three tins of paint, Airfix paint that you use for models, and I was -- it was a big children's home, big Victorian children's home -- and I was in a little turret at the top of it, and I poured them, red, yellow and green, the colors of Africa, down the tiles.
That home was full of young boys who were on remand for things like murder.
And this was the preparation that I was being given after 17 years as a child of the state.
I have to tell this story.


In the 17th century, a woman named Giulia Tofana had a very successful perfume business.
Take the emotion of fear, for instance. It keeps us away from doing things that are really, really risky.
This photo taken just before his death —  — is actually a — No, one reason this photo is interesting is because most people would not do this, and if they did, they would not live to tell it, because fear would have kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator.
Just like fear offers us protective benefits, disgust seems to do the same thing, except for what disgust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us, or heights, but rather things that might poison us, or give us disease and make us sick.

You could probably see it in the audience members when I showed you those disgusting images.
The way that we measured this was by a scale that was constructed by some other psychologists that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations how likely they are to feel disgust.
So here are a couple of examples.
So what do we do here? How do we pull ourselves and dig us out of this hole that we've dug?
If we look at biology, and many of you probably don't know, I was a biology major before I went into architecture, the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body, and it's a fantastic thing.
That's the first line of defense for the body.
And this gets me back to my research.
What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that.
I presently, or currently, work with smart materials, and a smart thermo-bimetal.

First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy, and that's a very big deal for architecture.

What it is, it's a lamination of two different metals together.
You can see that here by the different reflection on this side.
What it is, it's a lamination of two different metals together.
You can see that here by the different reflection on this side.
And because it has two different coefficients of expansion, when heated, one side will expand faster than the other and result in a curling action.
It's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access, but now it's sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer, it's a screen that goes around it, and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface.
In addition to that, it can also screen areas for privacy, so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas in the space during different times of day.
And what it basically implies is that, in houses now, we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things, as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building.
And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system.
They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles, and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down, and so in this project, I'm trying to look at how we can consider that in architecture too, how we can bring air through holes in the sides of a building.
And so you see here some early studies of blocks, where those holes are actually coming through, and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied, and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little hard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows.
Hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program.
The children must be woken at 7 and fed at 7:30.
At 8, their nappies must be changed, so a staff member may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children.
And when you look through them, you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber-illusionist.
Let me show you what I mean.
All we need is a playing card. Any card will do.
All we need is a playing card. Any card will do.
Like this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again.
All right. Very significant mark.
The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols, and have been interpreted in many different ways.
Now, some say that the four suits represent the four seasons.
There's spring, summer, autumn and â Voice: My favorite season is winter.MT: Well yeah, mine too.
I've found, after doing this for many, many years, that there's a magical world behind reality.
And that can be seen directly through a microscope, and I'm going to show you some of this today.
So let's start off looking at something rather not-so-small, something that we can see with our naked eye, and that's a bee. So when you look at this bee, it's about this size here, it's about a centimeter.
So that's just the eye of the bee with a microscope, and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia, and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes so they know when they're right up close to something, because they can't see in stereo.
As we go smaller, here is a human hair.
A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see.
So when we would look at cells, this is how I really got involved in biology and science is by looking at living cells in the microscope.
When I first saw living cells in a microscope, I was absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like.
So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system, they're actually moving all over the place.

And it's looking around, and when it finds something, and recognizes it being foreign, it will actually engulf it and eat it.

So this whole world, the nano world, this area in here is called the nano world, and the nano world, the whole micro world that we see, there's a nano world that is wrapped up within that, and the whole -- and that is the world of molecules and atoms.
But I want to talk about this larger world, the world of the micro world.
So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower, what would that flower look like, if the flower was this big?
So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower, what would that flower look like, if the flower was this big?
It wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see when we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here, and you're a little bug, if you're on that surface of that flower, that's what the terrain would look like.
The petal of that flower looks like that, so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects, and if you look a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here, this is the style of that flower, and you notice that it's got these little -- these are like little jelly-like things that are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs.

These are nectar spurs.
So this little ant that's crawling here, it's like it's in a little Willy Wonka land.
And the reason that is, is because in a place like this island, a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow, and when they die, their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand, things like coral and so forth.
So here's, for example, a picture of sand from Maui.
This is from Lahaina, and when we're walking along a beach, we're actually walking along millions of years of biological and geological history.
is a left-eye view. There's a right-eye view.
So sort of left-eye view, right-eye view.
Now something's interesting here. This looks very different than any sand on Earth that I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of sand on Earth, believe me.  Look at this hole in the middle. That hole was caused by a micrometeorite hitting the Moon.
Other sands, when these micrometeorites come in, they vaporize and they make these fountains, these microscopic fountains that go up into the -- I was going to say "up into the air," but there is no air -- goes sort of up, and these microscopic glass beads are formed instantly, and they harden, and by the time they fall down back to the surface of the Moon, they have these beautiful colored glass spherules.
And these are actually microscopic; you need a microscope to see these.
Now here's a grain of sand that is from the Moon, and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there.
Indeed, they do look very strange. We're humans.
We're a visual species. When scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night, we didn't believe it.
For a hundred years, despite evidence to show that this is what they were doing, we didn't believe it.
So through natural selection, over time, mutations, variations that disrupt the function of a protein will not be tolerated over time.
Evolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation.
And so therefore, if you look at the same region of a genome in many mammals that have been evolutionarily distant from each other and are also ecologically divergent, you will get a better understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is, i.e., if it is important for the mammal to function, for its survival, it will be the same in all of those different lineages, species, taxa.
This is where we're going to go, and as I said before, I really believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies within the bat genome.
So why should we be interested in aging at all?
Well, really, this is a picture drawn from the 1500s of the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered one of the most familiar, yet the least well-understood, aspects of all of biology, and really, since the dawn of civilization, mankind has sought to avoid it.
And we persisted, and we got 450 guys growing mustaches, and together we raised 54,000 dollars, and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received.
So from that day forward, my life has become about a mustache.
Every day -- this morning, I wake up and go, my life is about a mustache.  Essentially, I'm a mustache farmer.  And my season is November.   So in 2005, the campaign got more momentum, was more successful in Australia and then New Zealand, and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point.
So I cold-called the CEO of Prostate Cancer Canada, and I said to him, "I have this most amazing concept."
"It's going to transform your organization. I don't want to tell you about it now, but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto?" So I flew here, met down on Front Street East, and we sat in the boardroom, and I said, "Right, here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization."
And he looked at me and laughed and said, "Adam, sounds like a really novel idea, but we're an ultraconservative organization."  I've heard this before. I know how it goes.
So what we did was, we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country, the U.S, and the U.K., and we did that because we knew, if this was successful, we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia. And that money fuels research, and that research will get us to a cure.
And we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure, we're about finding the cure.
So in 2007, we brought the campaign across here, and it was, it set the stage for the campaign.
And that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches.  And for us, we have redefined charity.
Our ribbon is a hairy ribbon.  Our ambassadors are the Mo Bros and the Mo Sistas, and I think that's been fundamental to our success.
We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people.
Here's an example of the men and the height.
Along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile.
Along the y-axis, the vertical axis, is how tall they actually were.
Well, what explains all these studies? What explains the fact that despite our intuitions, mine included, a lot of online communication, technologically-mediated communication, is more honest than face to face?
That really is strange. How do we explain this?
Well, to do that, one thing is we can look at the deception-detection literature.
That really is strange. How do we explain this?
Well, to do that, one thing is we can look at the deception-detection literature.
It's a very old literature by now, it's coming up on 50 years.
It's a very old literature by now, it's coming up on 50 years.
It's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials, hundreds of studies, and there's some really compelling findings.
The first is, we're really bad at detecting deception, really bad. Fifty-four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not.
What does that mean? What's the next big idea from that?
Well, as a social scientist, this is the most amazing thing I have ever even dreamed of. Now, I can look at all those words that used to, for millennia, disappear.
I can look at lies that before were said and then gone.
In contrast, the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there, their bodies actually entered the physical space, they talked a lot more about spatial information.
They said how big the bathroom was, or they said, you know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel.
Now, you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task.
It's transformational. We're going to be able to learn so much more about human thought and expression, about everything from love to attitudes, because everything is being recorded now, but what does it mean for the average citizen?
What does it mean for us in our lives?
Well, let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas, I believe, is that we're leaving these huge traces behind.
Everyday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire.
I just took this out of the kiln last week, and the kiln itself takes another day or two to cool down, but raku is really fast. You do it outside, and you take the kiln up to temperature. In 15 minutes, it goes to 1,500 degrees, and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside, you can see that faint sheen, you turn the kiln off, and you reach in with these long metal tongs,
you grab the pot, and in Japan, this red-hot pot would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea, and you can imagine what that steam would smell like.
But here in the United States, we ramp up the drama a little bit, and we drop our pots into sawdust, which catches on fire, and you take a garbage pail, and you put it on top, and smoke starts pouring out.
I would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke.
I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements.
I find in so many things that tension between what I can control and what I have to let go happens all the time, whether I'm creating a new radio show or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons.
When I sat down to write a book about creativity, I realized that the steps were reversed.
I had to let go at the very beginning, and I had to immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists and writers and musicians and filmmakers, and as I listened to these stories, I realized that creativity grows out of everyday experiences more often than you might think, including letting go.
You know, the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana, the two holy books, the epics that everything comes out of in India, they say. After seeing that Jatra, the folk theater, I knew I wanted to get on, you know, and perform.
Julie Burstein: Isn't that a wonderful story?
You can see the sort of break in the everyday.
Artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do, sometimes pushing into what they can't do, helps them focus on finding their own voice.
The sculptor Richard Serra talks about how, as a young artist, he thought he was a painter, and he lived in Florence after graduate school.
While he was there, he traveled to Madrid, where he went to the Prado to see this picture by the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez.
It's from 1656, and it's called "Las Meninas," and it's the picture of a little princess and her ladies-in-waiting, and if you look over that little blonde princess's shoulder, you'll see a mirror, and reflected in it are her parents, the King and Queen of Spain, who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture.
As he often did, Velázquez put himself in this painting too.
He's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand and his palette in the other.
JM: Well, you know, ugly, I mean, powerful and tragic and horrific and everything, but it was also as, in nature, an enormous event that was transformed after the fact into this residue, and like many other ruins — you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace — and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather.
I mean, there were afternoons I was down there, and the light goes pink and there's a mist in the air and you're standing in the rubble, and I found myself recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature and the fact that nature, as time, is erasing this wound.
Time is unstoppable, and it transforms the event.
I want to leave you with another image of a Japanese tea bowl. This one is at the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C.
It's more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it.
But as you can also see, this one did break at some point in its hundred years.

But the person who put it back together, instead of hiding the cracks, decided to emphasize them, using gold lacquer to repair it.
They are not going to touch that, because it's not your matter.
Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton -- oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds, dollars.
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife?
But these are two products available in the U.S. that would be difficult to transfer into developing countries because they're much, much too expensive.
And the context I'm talking about is where you need to have a product that is less than 200 dollars.
And this ideal product would also be able to go about five kilometers a day so you could get to your job, get to school, and do it on many, many different types of terrain.

But when you get home or want to go indoors at your work, it's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside.
We use levers all the time, in tools, doorknobs, bicycle parts.
And that moment of inspiration, that key invention moment, was when I was sitting in front of my design notebook and I started thinking about somebody grabbing a lever, and if they grab near the end of the lever, they can get an effectively long lever and produce a lot of torque as they push back and forth, and effectively get a low gear.
And as they slide their hand down the lever, they can push with a smaller effective lever length, but push through a bigger angle every stroke, which makes a faster rotational speed, and gives you an effective high gear.

and this is important so the user can get up close to a toilet, and be able to transfer off just like he could in a normal wheelchair.
Now, there's three important points that I want to stress that I think really hit home in this project.
The first is that this product works well because we were effectively able to combine rigorous engineering science and analysis with user-centered design focused on the social and usage and economic factors important to wheelchair users in the developing countries.

So I'm an academic at MIT, and I'm a mechanical engineer, so I can do things like look at the type of terrain you want to travel on, and figure out how much resistance it should impose, look at the parts we have available and mix and match them to figure out what sort of gear trains we can use, and then look at the power and force you can get out of your upper body
to analyze how fast you should be able to go in this chair as you put your arms up and down the levers.

So as a wet-behind-the-ears student, excited, our team made a prototype, brought that prototype to Tanzania, Kenya and Vietnam in 2008, and found it was terrible because we didn't get enough input from users.
So because we tested it with wheelchair users, with wheelchair manufacturers, we got that feedback from them, not just articulating their problems, but articulating their solutions, and worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design, which we brought back to East Africa in '09 that worked a lot better than a normal wheelchair on rough terrain, but it still didn't work well indoors because it was too big,
But let's be frank.
When the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation?
Most of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old, not eight years old, and in fact, if we look at the projected demographics of video game play, the video game players of tomorrow are older adults.  So video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society.
The issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week, 10 hours per week, 15 hours per week.
By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?
Guess what? Their vision is really, really good.
By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?
Guess what? Their vision is really, really good.
It's better than those that don't play.
We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have. That would be a little costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer where we can measure, to millisecond accuracy, how good they are at switching from one task to another.
When we do that, we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really, really good.
They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.
When we do that, we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really, really good.
They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.
Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it in the context of another group of technology users, a group which is actually much revered by society, which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.
Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high multimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.
So you show them their data, you show them they are bad and they're like, "Not possible." You know, they have this sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good.
That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain.
That's the chocolate side of the equation.
The issue is we need to put the two together, and it's a little bit like with food.
Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?
But this voice kept calling me: "Come on, stay with me."
"No. It's too hard."
"Come on. This is our opportunity."
After 10 days, I made the decision to return to my body, and the internal bleeding stopped.
The next concern was whether I would walk again, because I was paralyzed from the waist down.
They said to my parents, the neck break was a stable fracture, but the back was completely crushed.
All I wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the door.
I wanted my old life back. I wanted my body back.
And I can remember Mom sitting on the end of my bed, and saying, "I wonder if life will ever be good again."
I now know that it wasn't until I let go of who I thought I was that I was able to create a completely new life.
It wasn't until I let go of the life I thought I should have that I was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me.
I now know that my real strength never came from my body, and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically, who I am is unchanged.
It is a struggle within, a struggle against vice, sin, temptation, lust, greed.
It is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the Koran.
In that original idea, the concept of jihad is as important to Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians.

That was the power of that word that he was able to do.

You charge another inmate to clean his cell.
There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.
There's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.
See, it wasn't enough for me to write a book.
It wasn't enough for me to join a slam competition, and while those things hold weight, it wasn't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad.
The hunger and thirst was, and still remains: How do I get people who hate poetry to love me?
So what, your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep?
Let me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon kung fu secret.
Boards don't hit back.
But what I'm going to tell you about today is how these tissues make awesome models.
Well, let's think about the drug screening process for a moment.
You go from drug formulation, lab testing, animal testing, and then clinical trials, which you might call human testing, before the drugs get to market.

It costs a lot of money, a lot of time, and sometimes, even when a drug hits the market, it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people.
This is an example from Karen Burg's lab, where they're using inkjet technologies to print breast cancer cells and study its progressions and treatments.
And some of our colleagues at Tufts are mixing models like these with tissue-engineered bone to see how cancer might spread from one part of the body to the next, and you can imagine those kinds of multi-tissue chips to be the next generation of these kinds of studies.
And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed, you can see, going forward, that tissue engineering is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening at every single step of the path: disease models making for better drug formulations, massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing, reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials, and individualized therapies that disrupt what we even consider to be a market at all.
Already, I'll give you an example.
In August of this year, the United States drug agency approved a new four-in-one AIDS medication.
The company, Gilead, that holds the patents, has licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool.


This is poo, and what I want to do today is share my passion for poo with you, which might be quite difficult, but I think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with poo.

So this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice, and yet it can do things that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing.
So, according to dung beetles, dung is pretty good.
Unless you're prepared to get dung under your fingernails and root through the dung itself, you'll never see 90 percent of the dung beetle species, because they go directly into the dung, straight down below it, and then they shuttle back and forth between the dung at the soil surface and a nest they make underground.
So the question is, how do they deal with this material?

So the question is, how do they deal with this material?
And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort.
And so valuable resources have to be looked after and guarded in a particular way, and we think the reason they roll the balls away is because of this, because of the competition that is involved in getting hold of that dung.
So this dung pat was actually -- well, it was a dung pat 15 minutes before this photograph was taken, and we think it's the intense competition that makes the beetles so well-adapted to rolling balls of dung.
So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the African veld.

So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the African veld.
Its head is down. It's walking backwards.
This is Africa. It's hot.
So what I want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used to investigate how dung beetles deal with these problems.
So watch this beetle, and there's two things that I would like you to be aware of.
So watch this beetle, and there's two things that I would like you to be aware of.
The first is how it deals with this obstacle that we've put in its way. See, look, it does a little dance, and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place.
A little dance, and then heads off in a particular direction.
So clearly this animal knows where it's going and it knows where it wants to go, and that's a very, very important thing, because if you think about it, you're at the dung pile, you've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else, and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line.
So we gave them some more tasks to deal with, and what we did here is we turned the world under their feet. And watch its response.
So this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet. It's turned by 90 degrees.
So a classic experiment here, in that what we did was we moved the sun.
What we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position.
And look at what the beetle does.
It does a little double dance, and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went in the first place.
What happens now? So clearly they're looking at the sun.
The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them.
But the sun is at the horizon over here and we know that when the sun is at the horizon, say it's over on this side, there is a north-south, a huge pathway across the sky of polarized light that we can't see that the beetles can see.
So how do we test that? Well, that's easy.
What we do is we get a great big polarization filter, pop the beetle underneath it, and the filter is at right angles to the polarization pattern of the sky.
And it was this particular little behavior, the dance, that we thought was important, because look, it takes a pause every now and then, and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in.
So what are they doing when they do this dance?
How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves?
So the truth is, if you look at the temperature over here, dung is cool.  So all we're interested in here is comparing the temperature of the beetle against the background.
So the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade.
The beetle itself and the ball are probably around about 30 to 35 degrees centigrade, so this is a great big ball of ice cream that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld.
It's up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade.
Watch how often the beetle dances.
And look at its front legs. They're roaringly hot.
So this is called stilting. It's a thermal behavior that you and I do if we cross the beach, we jump onto a towel, somebody has this towel -- "Sorry, I've jumped onto your towel." -- and then you scuttle across onto somebody else's towel, and that way you don't burn your feet.
And that's exactly what the beetles are doing here.
However, there's one more story I'd like to share with you, and that's this particular species.
They don't normally go this slowly. It's in slow motion.
but it's walking forwards, and it's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it.
This is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior.
The important thing here is that this is not a one-way trip, as in most dung beetles. The trip here is repeated back and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site.
And watch, you're going to see another South African crime taking place right now.  And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets.
So what we're looking at here is a behavior called path integration.
And watch, you're going to see another South African crime taking place right now.  And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets.
So what we're looking at here is a behavior called path integration.
And what's taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot, it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food, and then when it finds food, it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is.
So what we're looking at here is a behavior called path integration.
And what's taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot, it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food, and then when it finds food, it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is.
Now there's two ways it could be doing that, and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it's at the foraging site.

If it's using landmarks, it will find its home.

If it's using landmarks, it will find its home.
If it is using something called path integration, it will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot, and what it's doing here if it's using path integration is it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction.
He's about to head home, and look what happens.
Shame.
It hasn't a clue.
Shame.
It hasn't a clue.
It starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food, but it is clearly completely lost.
Yeah? And then a Swedish guy showed me my room.
I said, "Where are the Qataris?"   They said, "No, no, it's too hot. They come out later. They're smart."
"They know."  And of course, it's growing so fast, sometimes there's growing pains.
They're helping us find the news. They're helping us figure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear.
So it's a real-time thing. It's much quicker. It's happening on a constant basis, and the journalist is always playing catch up.
To give an example of how we rely on the audience, on the 5th of September in Costa Rica, an earthquake hit.
So it's a real-time thing. It's much quicker. It's happening on a constant basis, and the journalist is always playing catch up.
To give an example of how we rely on the audience, on the 5th of September in Costa Rica, an earthquake hit.
It was a 7.6 magnitude. It was fairly big.

It was a 7.6 magnitude. It was fairly big.
And 60 seconds is the amount of time it took for it to travel 250 kilometers to Managua.
And it turned out to be true. It was from Avenue C in downtown Manhattan, which was flooded.
And the reason that they could tell that it was real was because they could get to the source, and in this case, these guys were New York food bloggers.
They were well respected. They were known.
So we went to the white pages, and we found, we looked through the Rita Krills in the phonebook, and we looked through a couple of different addresses, and that took us to Google Maps, where we found a house.
And we found a house with a swimming pool that looked remarkably like Rita's. So we went back to the video, and we had to look for clues that we could cross-reference.
So if you look in the video, there's the big umbrella, there's a white lilo in the pool, there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool, and there's two trees in the background.
So if you look in the video, there's the big umbrella, there's a white lilo in the pool, there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool, and there's two trees in the background.
And we went back to Google Maps, and we looked a little bit closer, and sure enough, there's the white lilo, there are the two trees, there's the umbrella. It's actually folded in this photo.
Little bit of trickery. And there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool.

So we were able to call Rita, clear the video, make sure that it had been shot, and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried.
Sometimes the search for truth, though, is a little bit less flippant, and it has much greater consequences.
Syria has been really interesting for us, because obviously a lot of the time you're trying to debunk stuff that can be potentially war crime evidence, so this is where YouTube actually becomes the most important repository of information about what's going on in the world.
This is from Hama.
Video:  And what this video shows, when you watch the whole thing through, is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck and thrown off a bridge.
The allegations were that these guys were Muslim Brotherhood and they were throwing Syrian Army officers' bodies off the bridge, and they were cursing and using blasphemous language, and there were lots of counterclaims about who they were, and whether or not they were what the video said it was.
We looked through the video for other clues.
We saw the distinctive railings, which we could use.
We looked at the curbs. The curbs were throwing shadows south, so we could tell the bridge was running east-west across the river.
We're looking for one that crosses east-west.
And we get to Hama. We get all the way from the dam to Hama and there's no bridge.
So we go a bit further. We switch to the satellite view, and we find another bridge, and everything starts to line up.
But here's the thing. Algorithms are rules. They're binary.
They're yes or no, they're black or white.
Truth is never binary. Truth is a value.
Oh, we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes, and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation, but otherwise nothing will come of it.
We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver, and not a gem, nor any coal or iron.
We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food. So it is no use.
This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team.
Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the South Pole.
No one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped at the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica.
But what's really happening is that we've got the power of a free and open Internet, and on top of that we're putting a platform for participation, and the peers are now in partnership with the company, creating shared value on shared values, and each strengthening the other, and doing what the other can't do.
I call this Peers, Inc.
The incorporated side, the company, is doing things that it does really well.

He said, "We have a community that owns its own company."
And then my all-time favorite, Etsy.
Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they're selling it in a marketplace.
Back to this spectrum.
So what's happening is, we had the yuck side, but we actually had this real wow side.
And I can tell you two great stories.
So you can have these really nice things that can't happen, and it's a kind of "Wow!" and I want to say "Wow!"
type of thing that's happening here, because individuals, if you're a company, what happens is you might have 10 people who are in charge of innovation, or 100 people who are in charge of innovation.
What happens in Peer, Inc. companies is that you have tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions of people who are creating experiments on this model, and so out of all that influence and that effort, you are having this exceptional amount of innovation that is coming out.
So I continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe.
All problems come back to transportation for me.
But there are all these other areas that are these profound, big problems that I know that we can work on, and people are working on them in many different sectors, but there's this really fabulous group of things with the power of this Peers, Inc. model.
The brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain called the insula, a region they say is linked to feelings of love and compassion.
So they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula, this meant the subjects loved their iPhones.
Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning, and that's that the insula does a lot.
So for a few days, that's how my living room was.
And we received Israeli posters, Israeli images, but also lots of comments, lots of messages from Iran.
And we took these messages and we made posters out of it, because I know people: They don't read, they see images.
And I'm not that naive, because a lot of the time I've been asked, many times I've been asked, "Yeah, but, this is really naive, sending flowers over, I mean — " I was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years, and I know how it looks from the ground.
I know how it can look really bad.
So to me, this is the courageous thing to do, to try to reach the other side before it's too late, because when it's going to be too late, it's going to be too late.
So I want to ask Michal, my wife, to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image, because it's all about images.
And maybe that image will help us change something.
Just raise that. Exactly.
Neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due, so he said, December, you're just going to see lots of angry negotiations, negotiations breaking apart, reports of phone calls that aren't going well, people saying nothing's happening at all, and then sometime around Christmas or New Year's, we're going to hear, "Okay, they resolved everything."
He told me that a few months ago. He said he's 98 percent positive they're going to resolve it, and I got an email from him today saying, all right, we're basically on track, but now I'm 80 percent positive that they're going to resolve it.
And it made me think. I love studying these moments in American history when there was this frenzy of partisan anger, that the economy was on the verge of total collapse.
But then we got off the gold standard for individuals during the Depression and we got off the gold standard as a source of international currency coordination during Richard Nixon's presidency.
Each of those times, we were on the verge of complete collapse.
And nothing happened at all.
Motion pictures are themselves an illusion of life, produced by the sequential projection of still frames, and they astonished the Lumière brothers' early audiences.
Even today's sophisticated moviegoers still lose themselves to the screen, and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality to great effect.
Now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over 400 years.

Giambattista della Porta, a Neapolitan scholar in the 16th century, examined and studied the natural world and saw how it could be manipulated.
They could be quite mild.
You could develop nausea, headache, your muscles could feel like they're contracting, and you could actually feel like your bones are breaking.
And that's the nickname given to this disease.
It's called breakbone fever, because that's how you can feel.
Now the odd thing is, is that once you've been bitten by this mosquito, and you've had this disease, your body develops antibodies, so if you're bitten again with that strain, it doesn't affect you.
But it's not one virus, it's four, and the same protection that gives you the antibodies and protects you from the same virus that you had before actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three.
Here what someone is doing is mixing up chemical in a smoke and basically spreading that through the environment.
You could do the same with a space spray.
This is really unpleasant stuff, and if it was any good, we wouldn't have this massive increase in mosquitos and we wouldn't have this massive increase in dengue fever.
There's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there.
We want something that gets that population right the way down so it can't get the disease transmission.
Clearly the product you've got has got to be safe to humans.

We are going to use it in and around humans.
I'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies don't work well or have become unacceptable.
And although the techniques are similar, the outcomes are very, very different, and if you take our approach, for example, and you compare it to, say, G.M. crops, both techniques are trying to produce a massive benefit.
Both have a side benefit, which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously.
It causes them to distort reality.
We begin separating everything into good versus evil.
Now that process feels great. It feels really satisfying.
The moral electromagnet is turning back on, and nowadays, just very recently, Democrats really dislike Republicans.
Republicans really dislike the Democrats. We're changing.
It's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too.



And I think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people's lives.
For me, this means that they're seeing the value of difference, the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation, we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives.
For me, the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation.
Well, I eventually got to the Rhode Island School of Design.
I transferred to RISD as a sophomore, and it was there that I took every course that I could on writing, and it was there that I wrote a story about a giant orange slug who wanted to be friends with this kid.
The kid had no patience for him.
Yet what puzzled me most was Celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial, yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed.
Now, I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted.
Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results.

There seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin D is very good for you.
And it is, to prevent rickets and so on.
But if you give people vitamin D supplements, you don't change that high rate of heart disease.
But if you give people vitamin D supplements, you don't change that high rate of heart disease.
And the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great.
So what I'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town.
But I also became interested in research, and in particular I became interested in this substance, nitric oxide.
Now these three guys up here, Furchgott, Ignarro and Murad, won the Nobel Prize for medicine back in 1998.
And they were the first people to describe this new chemical transmitter, nitric oxide.
Now these three guys up here, Furchgott, Ignarro and Murad, won the Nobel Prize for medicine back in 1998.
And they were the first people to describe this new chemical transmitter, nitric oxide.
What nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels, so it lowers your blood pressure.
Very complex processes with very complex chemicals that fit into very complex receptors.
And here's this incredibly simple molecule, a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together, and yet these are hugely important for [unclear] our low blood pressure, for neurotransmission, for many, many things, but particularly cardiovascular health.
And I started doing research, and we found, very excitingly, that the skin produces nitric oxide.

And I started doing research, and we found, very excitingly, that the skin produces nitric oxide.
So it's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises.
It arises in the skin.
It arises in the skin.
Well, having found that and published that, I thought, well, what's it doing?
How do you have low blood pressure in your skin?
So they're really an ideal model.
But what we found was that we couldn't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice.
It seemed we couldn't turn off the production of nitric oxide in the skin of humans.
But certainly in people older than my wife, this appears to be a more marked effect.
And the other thing I should mention was there was no change in vitamin D.
This is separate from vitamin D.
So vitamin D is good for you -- it stops rickets, it prevents calcium metabolism, important stuff.
But this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D.
Now, one of the problems with looking at blood pressure is your body does everything it can to keep your blood pressure at the same place.
So what we've next done is we've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation.
So we've measured -- this is again, notice no tail and hairless, this is a medical student.
In the arm, you can measure blood flow in the arm by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it.
So we thought we'd just kind of model -- Different amounts of UV hit different parts of the Earth at different times of year, so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide -- the nitrates, nitrites, nitrosothiols in the skin -- cleave to release NO.
Different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that.
So you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that.
So you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that.
And you can look -- So, if you live on the equator, the sun comes straight overhead, it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere.
In winter or summer, it's the same amount of light.
Ventura mid-winter, well, there's still a decent amount.
Edinburgh in summer, the area beneath the curve is pretty good, but Edinburgh in winter, the amount of NO that can be released is next to nothing, tiny amounts.
So what do we think?
Edinburgh in summer, the area beneath the curve is pretty good, but Edinburgh in winter, the amount of NO that can be released is next to nothing, tiny amounts.
So what do we think?
We're still working at this story, we're still developing it, we're still expanding it.
We think it probably accounts for a lot of the north-south health divide within Britain, It's of relevance to us.
We think that the skin -- well, we know that the skin has got very large stores of nitric oxide as these various other forms.
We suspect a lot of these come from diet, green leafy vegetables, beetroot, lettuce has a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin.
If you have kids, you know what I mean.
Almost everything kids do is art.
They draw with crayons on the wall.
All right! It calls for celebration.
For example, a kid says, "Mom, guess what? I met an alien on my way home."
Then a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense."
For example, a kid says, "Mom, guess what? I met an alien on my way home."
Then a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense."
Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything?
And you continue to make connections.
Take a look at this sentence: "One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug."
Yes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis."
They talk about these kinds of experiences.
You must have had such a moment.
In that moment, art makes you happy because it's not work.
In that moment, art makes you happy because it's not work.
Work doesn't make you happy, does it? Mostly it's tough.
The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.

"Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired."
And I explained, "It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch."
Then my teacher said, "Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling."
Or so I wished.
I have students like you in the class -- many who don't major in writing.
Some major in art or music and think they can't write.
So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.
The magic question is, "What for?"
But art is not for anything.
Art is the ultimate goal.
But art is not for anything.
Art is the ultimate goal.
It saves our souls and makes us live happily.
There's silence.
Finally, my favorite student, she looks me straight in the eye, and she says, "The reading sucked."
And then she clarified. She said, "You know what, I don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it.
But if you're a virus and you see this, you cross those little legs of yours and you think, "We rock."
Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium.
Here's what had to happen.
Here's what had to happen.
A virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its DNA into it.
The next thing is, that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA.
Because, you see, DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make.
So this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots.
The workers still come the next day, they do their job, but they're following different instructions.
Right? I mean, because God forbid somebody have fun when they're learning science.
So we have this field of science that's all about slime, and color changes. Check this out.
And then we have, of course, as any good scientist has to have, explosions!
Not necessarily.
There is a precedent for technology-enabled service that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries and has been hugely successful: national lotteries.
Let's take Britain as an example.

Could we use the same model?
I believe we could.

Let's call it national e-markets, NEMs for short.
Think of it as a regulated public utility.
Think of it as a regulated public utility.
So it's on a par with the water supply or the road network.
And it's a series of markets for low-level trade that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company.
But coding doesn't have to be like this.
Let me show you about what it's like to code in Scratch.
So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together.
We're going to continue to look at new ways of bringing together the physical world and the virtual world and connecting to the world around us.
This is an example from a new version of Scratch that we'll be releasing in the next few months, and we're looking again to be able to push you in new directions.
Here's an example.
It uses the webcam.
And as I move my hand, I can pop the balloons or I can move the bug.
So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect, where you interact with gestures in the world.
I'll call it score.
And that creates some new blocks for you, and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score, so each time I click on "change score," it increments the score.
So I showed this to the clubhouse member -- let's call him Victor -- and Victor, when he saw that this block would let him increment the score, he knew exactly what to do.
Most people died around the age of 50.
So let's move to chapter two: the oil era.
1939, that's when they discovered oil.
1939, that's when they discovered oil.
But unfortunately, it wasn't really fully exploited commercially until after the Second World War.
What did it do?
We can print drugs at point of need.
We can download new diagnostics.
Say a new super bug has emerged.
So, I'm an artist.
I live in New York, and I've been working in advertising for -- ever since I left school, so about seven, eight years now, and it was draining.
I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends, and I found myself never having time for all the projects that I wanted to work on on my own.
Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are, wouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this?
I turned 31 last week, which is there.
I think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this.
What are colors doing to us?"
And we made a poll, the most fascinating poll I've seen in my life.
We asked people, "Do you want this action, and to have buildings painted like that?"
And we made a poll, the most fascinating poll I've seen in my life.
We asked people, "Do you want this action, and to have buildings painted like that?"
And then the second question was, "Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue?"
We asked people, "Do you want this action, and to have buildings painted like that?"
And then the second question was, "Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue?"
To the first question, 63 percent of people said yes, we like it.
And then the second question was, "Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue?"
To the first question, 63 percent of people said yes, we like it.
Thirty-seven said no, we don't like it.
And this was not a misplaced feeling.
Crime did fall.
The freedom that was won in 1990 brought about a state of anarchy in the city, while the barbarism of the '90s brought about a loss of hope for the city.
We removed 123,000 tons of concrete only from the riverbanks.
We demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings all over the city, up to eight stories high, the tallest of them.
We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets.
This is how the world looked then in terms of PISA performance.
The first thing you can see is that the bubbles were a lot smaller, no?
We spent a lot less on education, about 35 percent less on education.
I ended up in physics by accident.
It was a random encounter when I was young, and since then, I've often wondered about the amazing success of physics in describing the reality we wake up in every day.
In a nutshell, you can think of physics as follows.

In a nutshell, you can think of physics as follows.
So you take a chunk of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics.
Where are economic networks?
This is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature.
The study we published last year called "The Network of Global Corporate Control" was the first extensive analysis of economic networks.
These are companies that operate in more than one country, and we found 43,000.
In the next step, we built the network around these companies, so we took all the TNCs' shareholders, and the shareholders' shareholders, etc., all the way upstream, and we did the same downstream, and ended up with a network containing 600,000 nodes and one million links.
This is the TNC network which we analyzed.
It's an emergent property which depends on the rules of interaction in the system, so it's probably not the result of a top-down approach like a global conspiracy.
Our study "is an impression of the moon's surface.
It's not a street map."
Now there is still a big problem, in my opinion.
Ideas relating to finance, economics, politics, society, are very often tainted by people's personal ideologies.
I really hope that this complexity perspective allows for some common ground to be found.
A crisis of desire, as in owning the wanting -- desire as an expression of our individuality, of our free choice, of our preferences, of our identity -- desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies.
You know, this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term not because we want 14 children, for which we need to have even more because many of them won't make it, and not because it is exclusively a woman's marital duty.
This is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire.
They don't really do well together.
Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes.
It's pretty much like the moon. It has intermittent eclipses.
Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes.
It's pretty much like the moon. It has intermittent eclipses.
But what they know is they know how to resurrect it.
Over 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation.
Now while these findings are suggestive, countries can be different in so many different ways that it's very, very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences.
What I'm going to show you, though, is something that I've been engaging in for a year, which is trying to gather all of the largest datasets that we have access to as economists, and I'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences, hoping to get this relationship to break.
And Aurora liked to play video games.
As you can see here, she likes to use a joystick, like any one of us, any of our kids, to play this game.
And as a good primate, she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer.
So he figured out. "Well," he said, "okay, you'll go to school after the ceremony."
I did. The ceremony happened.
It's a whole week long of excitement.
As you can imagine, I bled. I bled.
After bleeding for a while, I fainted thereafter.
It's something that so many girls -- I'm lucky, I never died -- but many die.
and focus on the behaviors that I think fruit flies excel at doing.
And so I want to show you a high-speed video sequence of a fly shot at 7,000 frames per second in infrared lighting, and to the right, off-screen, is an electronic looming predator that is going to go at the fly.
The fly is going to sense this predator.
What's clever is the way the fly flaps it, which of course ultimately is controlled by the nervous system, and this is what enables flies to perform these remarkable aerial maneuvers.
Now, what about the engine?
The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating.
Now, what about the engine?
The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating.
They have two types of flight muscle: so-called power muscle, which is stretch-activated, which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled on a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system.
But I would argue that flies do more.
So for example, I'm going to show you a sequence, and I have to say, some of my funding comes from the military, so I'm showing this classified sequence and you cannot discuss it outside of this room. Okay?
So I want you to look at the payload at the tail of the fruit fly.
And it's a beautifully complex neuron.
It's just very, very tiny, and there's lots of biophysical challenges with trying to compute information with tiny, tiny neurons.
How small can neurons get? Well, look at this interesting insect.
Crab chewing is actually really fascinating.
Crabs have this complicated structure under their carapace called the gastric mill that grinds their food in a variety of different ways.
And here's an endoscopic movie of this structure.
Well, for many years in my laboratory and other laboratories around the world, we've been studying fly behaviors in little flight simulators.
You can tether a fly to a little stick.
You can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating.
So here's a picture of the octopamine system.
Octopamine is a neuromodulator that seems to play an important role in flight and other behaviors.
But this is just one of many neuromodulators that's in the fly's brain.
David said when they brought this system into their home, the family meetings in particular increased communication, decreased stress, and made everybody happier to be part of the family team.
When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters, it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born.
And these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes.
In Sutherland's system, companies don't use large, massive projects that take two years.
They do things in small chunks.
Nothing takes longer than two weeks.
The answer, I believe, is yes.
When Leo Tolstoy was five years old, his brother Nikolay came to him and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness on a little green stick, which he had hidden in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia.
If the stick were ever found, all humankind would be happy.

Tolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.
Tolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.
In fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden.
He still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass.
That story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that I learned: Happiness is not something we find, it's something we make.
Almost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations has come to pretty much the same conclusion.
Greatness is not a matter of circumstance.
What is going to be the future of learning?
I do have a plan, but in order for me to tell you what that plan is, I need to tell you a little story, which kind of sets the stage.
I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools, where did it come from?
I do have a plan, but in order for me to tell you what that plan is, I need to tell you a little story, which kind of sets the stage.
I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools, where did it come from?
And you can look far back into the past, but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is, it's quite easy to figure out where it came from.
But the Victorians actually did it.
What they did was amazing.
They created a global computer made up of people.
What they did was amazing.
They created a global computer made up of people.
It's still with us today.
I said schools as we know them now, they're obsolete.
I'm not saying they're broken.
It's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken.
I'm not saying they're broken.
It's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken.
It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.

It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.
What did the poor do wrong?
I made a hole in the boundary wall of the slum next to my office, and stuck a computer inside it just to see what would happen if I gave a computer to children who never would have one, didn't know any English, didn't know what the Internet was.
The children came running in.
And I said, I'll measure them. They'll get a zero.
I'll spend a couple of months, I'll leave it for a couple of months, I'll go back, they'll get another zero.
I'll go back to the lab and say, we need teachers.
I think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning as the product of educational self-organization.
If you allow the educational process to self-organize, then learning emerges.
It's not about making learning happen.
But that's not sexy enough.
The way you would put it to a nine-year-old is to say, "If a meteorite was coming to hit the Earth, how would you figure out if it was going to or not?"
And if he says, "Well, what? how?"
But that's not sexy enough.

And if he says, "Well, what? how?"
And if he says, "Well, what? how?"
you say, "There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle," and leave him alone. He'll figure it out.
So here are a couple of images from SOLEs.
And I've got to -- hang on, I've got to get this wording exactly right, because, you know, it's very important.
My wish is to help design a future of learning by supporting children all over the world to tap into their wonder and their ability to work together.
Help me build this school.
We have a little tiny community called Greenville, Michigan, population 8,000, and they are about to lose their major employer, which is a refrigerator factory that's operated by Electrolux."
And I said, "Well, how many people work at Electrolux?"
And he said, "3,000 of the 8,000 people in Greenville."
And that was asked not just by that guy but by everyone in the pavilion, and frankly, by every worker at one of the 50,000 factories that closed in the first decade of this century.
Enigma number one: How do you create jobs in America in a global economy?
Number two, very quickly: How do you solve global climate change when we don't even have a national energy policy in this country and when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm?
We sign with a major label.
And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret.
It's not for everybody.
It's not for everybody.
Well, maybe it's for you.
We sign, and there's all this hype leading up to our next record.
Now, the main defense against pack-hunting predators is to get into herds, and the larger the herd, the safer the individuals.
Now, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food, and they have to keep moving, and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants, while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil, as we see where a herd has passed.
This picture is a typical seasonal grassland.

The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here.
The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher, and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers.
They put 25,000 sheep in one flock, really mimicking nature now with planned grazing, and they have documented a 50-percent increase in the production of the land in the first year.
But worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty, violence, social breakdown and war, and as I am talking to you, millions of men, women and children are suffering and dying.
And if this continues, we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing, even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels.
I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this.
It's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier.  But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics and they sound like the Ventana.  I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away.
So for the deep sea squid hunt, I proposed using an optical lure attached to a camera platform with no thrusters, no motors, just a battery-powered camera, and the only illumination coming from red light that's invisible to most deep-sea animals that are adapted to see primarily blue.
That's visible to our eye, but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.
So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa, could just be thrown off the back of the ship, attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line, it would just float around passively carried by the currents, and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure, which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly, because it was designed to imitate
the bioluminescent display of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla.
Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense.
What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used, a one-meter long diamondback squid had a light attached to it, a squid jig of the type that longline fishermen use, and I think it was this light that brought the giant in.
Now, what you're seeing is the intensified camera's view under red light, and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.
And then he got so excited, he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better, and the giant didn't run away, so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible, bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high-resolution video.


There's so many of you.
I'm not the only kid who grew up this way, surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme about sticks and stones, as if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called, and we got called them all.
So we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us, that we'd be lonely forever, that we'd never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their toolshed.
So broken heartstrings bled the blues, and we tried to empty ourselves so we'd feel nothing.
He was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy, started therapy in eighth grade, had a personality made up of tests and pills, lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs, four-fifths suicidal, a tidal wave of antidepressants, and an adolescent being called "Popper," one part because of the pills, 99 parts because of the cruelty.
He tried to kill himself in grade 10 when a kid who could still go home to Mom and Dad had the audacity to tell him, "Get over it."
As if depression is something that could be remedied by any of the contents found in a first-aid kit.
But before I do that, I want to ask if we even believe that the nonprofit sector has any serious role to play in changing the world.
A lot of people say now that business will lift up the developing economies, and social business will take care of the rest.
And I do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward.
Interestingly, we don't have a visceral reaction to the notion that people would make a lot of money not helping other people.
You know, you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids, go for it.
We'll put you on the cover of Wired magazine.
So we tell the for-profit sector, "Spend, spend, spend on advertising, until the last dollar no longer produces a penny of value."
But we don't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity.
Our attitude is, "Well, look, if you can get the advertising donated, you know, to air at four o'clock in the morning, I'm okay with that.
Here they've come all the way across the Atlantic to make all this money, but making all this money will get you sent directly to Hell.
What were they to do about this?
Well, charity became their answer.
This is what happens when we confuse morality with frugality.
We've all been taught that the bake sale with five percent overhead is morally superior to the professional fundraising enterprise with 40 percent overhead, but we're missing the most important piece of information, which is: What is the actual size of these pies?
Who cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if it's tiny?
This view is conditioned by the fact that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders, like Prozac, act by globally changing brain chemistry, as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup.
But that can't be the answer, because these drugs actually don't work all that well.
A lot of people won't take them, or stop taking them, because of their unpleasant side effects.
So if we inhibit a particular type of neuron, and we find that a behavior is blocked, we can conclude that those neurons are necessary for that behavior.
On the other hand, if we activate a group of neurons and we find that that produces the behavior, we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior.
So in this way, by doing this kind of test, we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particular behaviors, something that is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to do right now in humans.
And this is one of the great things about fruit flies.
There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants and screen them in your assay and then find out what gene is affected in the mutation.
So doing the screen, we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs, and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation, it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor.


Now, extinction is a different kind of death.
It's bigger.
We didn't really realize that until 1914, when the last passenger pigeon, a female named Martha, died at the Cincinnati zoo.
This had been the most abundant bird in the world that'd been in North America for six million years.
There's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things, and it happened to lots of birds that people loved.
It happened to lots of mammals.
Another keystone species is a famous animal called the European aurochs.
You have to figure out exactly what genes matter.
So there's genes for the short tail in the band-tailed pigeon, genes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon, and so on with the red eye, peach-colored breast, flocking, and so on.
Add them all up and the result won't be perfect.
Henri, from the Netherlands, with a Dutch last name I won't try to pronounce, is working on the aurochs.
The aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle, and so basically its genome is alive, it's just unevenly distributed.
So what they're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive, hardy-looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there to rebuild, over time, with selective back-breeding, the aurochs.
Let me show you some examples.
So conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of using the traditional printed circuit boards or wires.
In the case of this little example I'm holding, we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light.
There's barely any information available on how to use them, and very little is said about how they are produced.
So for now, they exist mostly in this realm of trade secrets and patents only universities and corporations have access to.
So a little over three years ago, Kirsty Boyle and I started a project we called Open Materials.
["Paper speakers"] What we're seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player and a magnet.
So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT, Hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink.
Just like Jordan and so many other makers, Hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them.
If they had some extra bandwidth, they would deliver a message for you.
You'd kind of depend on people to do that, and that was the building block.
It was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department, but it obviously worked really well, and we all saw what happened with the Internet.

It was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department, but it obviously worked really well, and we all saw what happened with the Internet.
It was incredibly successful.
So, for instance, in all of Asia recently, it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while because Pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network.
They didn't intend to screw up Asia, but they did because of the way that the protocols work.
Another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is, you may remember a couple of years ago, all the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in Salt Lake City had a bug in it.
What they'll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the Iranian nuclear facility.
Nobody has claimed credit for that.
There was basically a factory of industrial machines.
Nobody has claimed credit for that.
There was basically a factory of industrial machines.
It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet.
And I think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that, because it's actually kind of fragile.
So actually, in the early days, back when it was the ARPANET, there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it.
And the way the Internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places, and this one processor, because of a broken card, decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time.

Now, of course you couldn't do that today.
I mean, everything off, it's like the service call you get from the cable company, except for the whole world.
Now, in fact, they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today.
So we've built this system where we understand all the parts of it, but we're using it in a very, very different way than we expected to use it, and it's gotten a very, very different scale than it was designed for.
And in fact, nobody really exactly understands all the things it's being used for right now.
It's turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system, where we've designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have.

And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet and saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that, you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather, or something like that.

They have an informed opinion, but it's changing so quickly that even the experts don't know exactly what's going on.
So if you see one of these maps of the Internet, it's just somebody's guess.
They have an informed opinion, but it's changing so quickly that even the experts don't know exactly what's going on.
So if you see one of these maps of the Internet, it's just somebody's guess.
Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now because it's different than it was an hour ago.
It's basically a matter of deciding to do it.
But people won't decide to do it until they recognize the need for it, and that's the problem that we have right now.
So there's been plenty of people, plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years, but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B when plan A seems to be working so well.
The question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport?
And in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with a really energy efficient car, so that means making it incredibly light, and so what you're seeing here is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car made in North America.
In fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack.

CA: But in a gallon of gasoline, you have, effectively, thousands of years of sun power compressed into a small space, so it's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar, and to remotely compete with, for example, natural gas, fracked natural gas. How are you going to build a business here?
EM: Well actually, I'm confident that solar will beat everything, hands down, including natural gas.
CA: How?
What are you doing?
EM: No, we actually are. You can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system.
Most people choose to lease.
EM: No, we actually are. You can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system.
Most people choose to lease.
And the thing about solar power is that it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs, so once it's installed, it's just there.
You haven't patented this stuff. It's really interesting to me.
EM: No, we don't patent.CA: You didn't patent because you think it's more dangerous to patent than not to patent.
EM: Since our primary competitors are national governments, the enforceability of patents is questionable.  CA: That's really, really interesting.
So that's just to give a sense of scale.
We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket.  CA: All right, let's see that video then, because this is actually amazing when you think about it.
You've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then -- EM: Yeah, so that rocket is about the size of a 12-story building.
You bet your fortune on it, and you seem to have done that multiple times.
I mean, almost no one can do that.
Is that -- could we have some of that secret sauce?
Well, what does this really look like?
Well, what is it to make a therapeutic, anyway?
What's a drug? A drug is made up of a small molecule of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and a few other atoms all cobbled together in a shape, and it's those shapes that determine whether, in fact, that particular drug is going to hit its target.
Here it is. That's the same kid.
That's Danny Bessette, 23 years later, because this is the year, and it's also the year where Danny got married, where we have, for the first time, the approval by the FDA of a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis based upon all this molecular understanding.
That's the good news.
The bad news is, this drug doesn't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis, and it won't work for Danny, and we're still waiting for that next generation to help him.
But it took 23 years to get this far. That's too long.
How do we go faster?
It's called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging.
Only about one in every four million kids has this disease, and in a simple way, what happens is, because of a mutation in a particular gene, a protein is made that's toxic to the cell and it causes these individuals to age at about seven times the normal rate.
Let me show you a video of what that does to the cell.
A progeria cell, on the other hand, because of this toxic protein called progerin, has these lumps and bumps in it.
So what we would like to do after discovering this back in 2003 is to come up with a way to try to correct that.
Well again, by knowing something about the molecular pathways, it was possible to pick one of those many, many compounds that might have been useful and try it out.
And you could expect quite a lot to come from this.
There are quite a number of success stories one can point to about how this has led to major advances.
The first drug for HIV/AIDS was not developed for HIV/AIDS.
There are quite a number of success stories one can point to about how this has led to major advances.
The first drug for HIV/AIDS was not developed for HIV/AIDS.
It was developed for cancer. It was AZT.
At NIH, we have started this new National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.
It just started last December, and this is one of its goals.
Let me tell you another thing we could do.
How do we know, for instance, whether drugs are safe before we give them to people? We test them on animals.
And it's not all that reliable, and it's costly, and it's time-consuming.
Suppose we could do this instead on human cells.
And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise, and as we sat there, over the mountains coming in from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds rolling toward us, and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley, so help me God, every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time.
This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen.
And then the clouds came over us, and then, boom! This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain.
I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach, Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College, some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and —  -- and in the second half of the piece, the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers from 30 different countries.
Now, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go, but there's still less than a second of latency, but in musical terms, that's a lifetime.
We deal in milliseconds.
There's a new microbe, I just discovered it.
It's called BLIS, and it's been shown to both ward off pathogens and give you good breath.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones?

It's that afraid of the water.
So what's going on here? What's happening?
Well, the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface.
It's that afraid of the water.
So what's going on here? What's happening?
Well, the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface.
You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.
And it has billions of interstitial spaces, and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles, reach up and grab the air molecules, and cover the surface with air.
It's an umbrella of air all across it, and that layer of air is what the water hits, the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.

I'm going to talk about the strategizing brain.
We're going to use an unusual combination of tools from game theory and neuroscience to understand how people interact socially when value is on the line.
A very different theory, a much more popular one, and an older one, due largely to John Nash of "A Beautiful Mind" fame, is what's called equilibrium analysis.
So if you've ever taken a game theory course at any level, you will have learned a little bit about this.
An equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody has figured out exactly what everyone else will do.
Now we move the payoffs.
We're actually going to make the left, left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher.
Now they get three apple cubes.
Now, what can we say about democracy in Lesterland?
What we can say, number one, as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United, that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials, because, after all, there is a general election, but only after the Lesters have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in the general election.
And number two, obviously, this dependence upon the Lesters is going to produce a subtle, understated, we could say camouflaged, bending to keep the Lesters happy.
And not works for the left or the right, but works for the left and the right, the citizens of the left and right, because there is no sensible reform possible until we end this corruption.
So I want you to take hold, to grab the issue you care the most about.
Climate change is mine, but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax system or inequality.

Do you have that love?
Because if you do, then what the hell are you, what are the hell are we doing?
When Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in September of 1787, he was stopped in the street by a woman who said, "Mr. Franklin, what have you wrought?"
A republic. A representative democracy.
A government dependent upon the people alone.
We have lost that republic.
This is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam, where I work as a curator.
It's my job to make sure the collection stays okay, and that it grows, and basically it means I collect dead animals.
Back in 1995, we got a new wing next to the museum.
Back in 1995, we got a new wing next to the museum.
It was made of glass, and this building really helped me to do my job good.
The building was a true bird-killer.
After 75 minutes —  — I had seen enough, and I got hungry, and I wanted to go home.
So I went out, collected the duck, and before I put it in the freezer, I checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex.
And here's a rare picture of a duck's penis, so it was indeed of the male sex.
Dan won his prize in medicine for demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine works better than low-priced fake medicine.
So here's my one minute of fame, my acceptance speech, and here's the duck.
This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast.
This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast.
I'm going to pass it around.
Yeah?
The only thing this bird did was fly against this window from 2004 to 2008, day in and day out.
Here he goes, and here's a short video.
So what this bird does is fight his own image.
So today we're going to show you one example of how you can use this.
Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is, but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco.
[6 Mile Range] [Top Speed Near 20mph] [Uphill Climbing] [Regenerative Braking]   So we're going to show you what this thing can do.
"Instead, let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos."
But instead, people go down, and after they recover, they go up again.
And if you think about mountain climbing as an example, it suggests all kinds of things.
But instead, people go down, and after they recover, they go up again.
And if you think about mountain climbing as an example, it suggests all kinds of things.
It suggests that we care about reaching the end, a peak.
And if you think about mountain climbing as an example, it suggests all kinds of things.
It suggests that we care about reaching the end, a peak.
It suggests that we care about the fight, about the challenge.
And we had three conditions.
In the first condition, people wrote their name on the sheet, found all the pairs of letters, gave it to the experimenter, the experimenter would look at it, scan it from top to bottom, say "Uh huh," and put it on the pile next to them.
In the second condition, people did not write their name on it.

In the second condition, people did not write their name on it.
The experimenter looked at it, took the sheet of paper, did not look at it, did not scan it, and simply put it on the pile of pages.
In the second condition, people did not write their name on it.
The experimenter looked at it, took the sheet of paper, did not look at it, did not scan it, and simply put it on the pile of pages.
So you take a piece, you just put it on the side.
You shred people's efforts, output -- you get them not to be as happy with what they're doing.
But I should point out, by the way, that in the shredder condition, people could have cheated.
They could have done not so good work, because they realized people were just shredding it.
So in fact, in the shredder condition, people could have submitted more work and gotten more money, and put less effort into it.
But what about the ignored condition?
Would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder, or somewhere in the middle?
No, the taste was great.
What they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved.
It was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say, "Here is my cake."
We gave them instructions on how to create origami, and we gave them a sheet of paper.
And these were all novices, and they built something that was really quite ugly -- nothing like a frog or a crane.
But then we told them, "Look, this origami really belongs to us.
You worked for us, but I'll tell you what, we'll sell it to you.
How much do you want to pay for it?"
And we measured how much they were willing to pay for it.
And we had two types of people: We had the people who built it, and the people who did not build it, and just looked at it as external observers.
And what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami -- and they were willing to pay five times more for them than the people who just evaluated them externally.
Now you could say -- if you were a builder, do you think [you'd say], "Oh, I love this origami, but I know that nobody else would love it?"
Or "I love this origami, and everybody else will love it as well?"
Which one of those two is correct?
Turns out the builders not only loved the origami more, they thought that everybody would see the world in their view.
At the top of the sheet, we had little diagrams of how you fold origami.
For some people, we just eliminated that.
So now this was tougher. What happened?
And the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein -- in this case it's the crambin protein -- you take the backbone -- so no cross-linking, no environmental interactions -- and you break that down into a series of components.
And then we embed elastic.
And when I throw this up into the air and catch it, it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein, all of the intricacies.
So today for the first time, we're unveiling a new project, which is a collaboration with Stratasys, and it's called 4D printing.
The idea behind 4D printing is that you take multi-material 3D printing -- so you can deposit multiple materials -- and you add a new capability, which is transformation, that right off the bed, the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own.
And this is like robotics without wires or motors.
I remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979 because it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school, that I was also going to miss "Hollywood Squares" and "Family Feud."
I was going to miss my game shows.
And later, in the mid-'80s, when "Jeopardy" came back on the air, I remember running home from school every day to watch the show.
And at first, it was very low.
There was no software that could compete at this kind of arena.
But then you see the line start to go up.
And I realized, this is it.
This is what it looks like when the future comes for you.
It's not the Terminator's gun sight; it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do, the only thing that makes you special, the thing you're best at.
Her parents thought about it, and they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her.
They told the lifeguard, they went back to the hotel, and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily, because that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami, the day after Christmas, 2004, that killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean.
But not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach, because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before.

Now when facts come in handy like that -- I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact, one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time -- normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life.

And it happens in real life all the time.
And I feel like we're sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in.
This is a question of leadership, because it becomes a question of who leads the future.
On the one hand, we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than it's ever been in human history, where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips.
When I was a 12-year-old child in the jail in Birmingham, I kept thinking, "I wonder what my future could be."
I had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in Birmingham to one day be president of a university that has students from 150 countries, where students are not there just to survive, where they love learning, where they enjoy being the best, where they will one day change the world.
Aristotle said, "Excellence is never an accident.

It is the result of high intention, sincere effort and intelligent execution.
It's dependent on specialists who just look at parts of us.
It's dependent on guesswork of diagnoses and drug cocktails, and so something either works or you die.
And it's dependent on passive patients who just take it and don't ask any questions.

Now the problem with this model is that it's unsustainable globally.
Now the problem with this model is that it's unsustainable globally.
It's unaffordable globally.
We need to invent what I call a personal health system.
Don't you in the front row worry or anything.
I'm going to use a device from a company called Mobisante.
This is a portable ultrasound.
It also shaped Darwin's scientific method, as well as that used by his peers.
[Science for the public good] Previously, it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen, or for one's own personal gain.
For example, ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports.
And for some reason that day, instead, I asked myself a question, and it was, where does this stuff go?
And with that question, I found myself plunged into the world of sanitation -- there's more coming --  — sanitation, toilets and poop, and I have yet to emerge.
And that's because it's such an enraging, yet engaging place to be.
And the cost to the world is immense: 260 billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation.
These are cholera beds in Haiti.
You'll have heard of cholera, but we don't hear about diarrhea.
We know, because in the mid-19th century, wonderful Victorian engineers installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment and the flush toilet, and disease dropped dramatically.
Child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history.
The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last 200 years by the readers of the British Medical Journal, and they were choosing over the Pill, anesthesia, and surgery.

It's a wonderful waste disposal device.
No one's going to refuse clean water.
But the humble latrine, or flush toilet, reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water.
Think about it. That little boy who's running back into his house, he may have a nice, clean fresh water supply, but he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with.
They've found in many developing countries that governments have gone in and given out free latrines and gone back a few years later and found that they've got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms with their owners happily walking past them and going over to the open defecating ground.
So the idea is to manipulate human emotion.
It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it in the early 20th century.
So the idea is to manipulate human emotion.
It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it in the early 20th century.
They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it.
But not just that.
She got her toilet, and now she goes around all the other villages in India persuading other women to do the same thing.
It's what I call social contagion, and it's really powerful and really exciting.
People go out and upgrade their toilet.
They talk about it. They've sanitized it.
I hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do.
Now, for some of you, you're going to say, "Oh my goodness, here we go again.
We're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules, or maybe into some sort of very flat, unidimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia.
When we talk about the brain, it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic.
The important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders, the one in five of us who struggle in some way, you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired, but there are some predictable patterns, and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders.
It's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed-out part of your cortex.
Here we're talking about traffic jams, or sometimes detours, or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions.
It was approaching 11 when I exited right toward Afula, and passed a large quarry and was soon in Kfar Kara.
I felt a pang of nerves.
But Chopin was on the radio, seven beautiful mazurkas, and I pulled into a lot by a gas station to listen and to calm.
One can say that a bad thing sucks, but that this natural world still has many glories.
I wished to tell him that, in the end, our mandate is clear: We have to rise above bad fortune.
We have to be in the good and enjoy the good, study and work and adventure and friendship -- oh, friendship -- and community and love.
I just wanted you to know that.
So I am indeed a neurosurgeon, and I follow a long tradition of neurosurgery, and what I'm going to tell you about today is adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain, being able to go anywhere in the brain and turning areas of the brain up or down to help our patients.
So as I said, neurosurgery comes from a long tradition.
When the malfunction is in a circuit that regulates your mood, you get things like depression, and when it is in a circuit that controls your memory and cognitive function, then you get things like Alzheimer's disease.
So what we've been able to do is to pinpoint where these disturbances are in the brain, and we've been able to intervene within these circuits in the brain to either turn them up or turn them down.
So this is very much like choosing the correct station on the radio dial.
So we've placed electrodes within this circuit in an area of the brain called the fornix, which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit, with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit, and whether that can, in turn, help these patients with Alzheimer's disease.
Now it turns out that in Alzheimer's disease, there's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain.
The brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose.
Linguists have actually shown that when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way, we tend to speak in word packets of maybe seven to 10 words.
You'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record yourself or a group of people talking.
That's what speech is like.
You'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record yourself or a group of people talking.
That's what speech is like.
Speech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic.
And so, texting is very loose in its structure.
No one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts, but then again, do you think about those things when you talk?
No, and so therefore why would you when you were texting?
No, and so therefore why would you when you were texting?
What texting is, despite the fact that it involves the brute mechanics of something that we call writing, is fingered speech. That's what texting is.
Now we can write the way we talk.
If you listen to the way black youth today speak, think about the use of the word "yo."
Whole dissertations could be written about it, and probably are being written about it.
A pragmatic particle, that's what LOL has gradually become.
Negative.
This led to a fantasy.
What if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record?
That comes out at five to 10 tons daily per square mile in cities.
Those horses also ate up fully one quarter of American agricultural land.
That's the percentage of American agricultural land it took to feed the horses.
Technology is not destiny.
We shape our destiny, and just as the earlier generations of managers needed to redesign their factories, we're going to need to reinvent our organizations and even our whole economic system.
We're not doing as well at that job as we should be.
And here's productivity.
You can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid-'70s, but it matches up pretty well with the Second Industrial Revolution, when factories were learning how to electrify their operations.
After a lag, productivity accelerated again.

So maybe "history doesn't repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes."
After a lag, productivity accelerated again.
So maybe "history doesn't repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes."
Today, productivity is at an all-time high, and despite the Great Recession, it grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s, the roaring 1990s, and that was faster than the '70s or '80s.
We have created more wealth in the past decade than ever, but for a majority of Americans, their income has fallen.
This is the great decoupling of productivity from employment, of wealth from work.
You know, it's not surprising that millions of people have become disillusioned by the great decoupling, but like too many others, they misunderstand its basic causes.
This is the great decoupling of productivity from employment, of wealth from work.

Technology is racing ahead, but it's leaving more and more people behind.
The machine won that day, and today, a chess program running on a cell phone can beat a human grandmaster.
It got so bad that, when he was asked what strategy he would use against a computer, Jan Donner, the Dutch grandmaster, replied, "I'd bring a hammer."
But today a computer is no longer the world chess champion.
Phthalates are horrible because they're so easily taken into our bodies.
They can be absorbed by skin contact, ingested, and inhaled.
JY: Every year, at least 470 million pounds of phthalates contaminate our air, water and soil.
MW: We monitored this experiment with spectrophotometry and obtained this beautiful graph.
This graph shows that our bacteria really do have a genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates.
Our bacteria can transform phthalates, which is a harmful toxin, into end products such as carbon dioxide, water and alcohol.
This guy is stopping, dead stop, dead stop on the highway.
It was just going 65 -- to zero?
I slammed on the brakes.
What you're doing, right now, at this very moment, is killing you.
More than cars or the Internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about, the technology you're using the most almost every day is this, your tush.
Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day, which is more than we're sleeping, at 7.7 hours.
Their burn-up is much higher.
So for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor, a lot more of it's being used.
And the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this is, you've got these rods that are clad in zirconium, and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets.
So even in the event of an accident, yeah, the reactor may be toast, which is, you know, sorry for the power company, but we're not going to contaminate large quantities of land.
So I really think that in the, say, 20 years it's going to take us to get fusion and make fusion a reality, this could be the source of energy that provides carbon-free electricity.
Carbon-free electricity.
And I'll just say one more maybe philosophical thing to end with, which is weird for a scientist.
But I think there's something really poetic about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars, because the stars are giant fusion reactors.
They're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky.
How powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks, who were not afraid to think, and who had a champion?
Every child deserves a champion, an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection, and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be.
Is this job tough? You betcha. Oh God, you betcha.
I have seven sisters. I'm one of the only men in my family, and they made together the decision to transfer this land to Léila and myself.
When we received this land, this land was as dead as I was.
When I was a kid, it was more than 50 percent rainforest.
absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos.
And so there's companies like face.com that now have about 18 billion faces online.
Here's what happened to this company.
Why the Greeks?
Well, the Greeks thought about what happens when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time.
So lesson number one: Sisyphus.
Now, who can bank between 10 and 3? The unemployed.
They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks.
Who created that business model? Right?
And it went on for decades.
You know why? Because they didn't care.
It wasn't about the customers.
They said it was the agrarian calendar, and people had — but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense.
I never got that. I never got that, because anyone knows if you farm, you don't plant crops in July and August.
You plant them in the spring.
Every time something didn't work, we just threw in the towel and said, "Let's forget it." Right?
You know, they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me -- the latest and greatest thing, the PalmPilot.
They told me, "Geoff, if you get this PalmPilot you'll never need another thing."
The second, thank you --  The second principle that drives human life flourishing is curiosity.
If you can light the spark of curiosity in a child, they will learn without any further assistance, very often.
Children are natural learners.
I mean, other animals may well have imaginations and creativity, but it's not so much in evidence, is it, as ours?
I mean, you may have a dog.
And your dog may get depressed.
The whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers for a while.
What it proved is this: that Death Valley isn't dead.
It's dormant.
Today, districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers, but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice.
Our teachers deserve better.
The system we have today isn't fair to them.
The impact for teachers would be phenomenal.
We would finally have a way to give them feedback, as well as the means to act on it.
But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country.
I don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to.
And this young woman, she made what she called a hula-looper, and as the hula hoop traveled around her body, she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there.
You can see her pointing to it in the picture.
You guys are facing that way, so I'll hook it to this one.
And I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it.
And now, if I touch this piece of pizza, the slides that I showed you before should go forward.
And then this brother -- look at this diagram.
See where it says "sister"?
I love when people put humans on the diagram.
And then all these professional musicians started using it, like at Coachella, just this weekend Jurassic 5 was using this onstage, and this D.J. is just from Brooklyn, right around here, and he put this up last month.
And I love the carrot on the turntable.
Most people cannot play them that way.  And when this started to get serious, I thought, I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in, because otherwise people are going to be getting this and they're going to be turning into agents of creative change, and governments will be crumbling, and I wouldn't have told people, so I thought I'd better warn them.
Through his eyes, we knew when he needed to hear again, "It is all set, Jim. We're going to take care of Shirley right here at the ranch, and ACR's going to take care of your wildlife forever."
From this experience I'm going to share five practices.
I've put worksheets online, so if you'd like, you can plan your own end.
Because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life, how you want to connect to information.
Should it be by just walking around looking down?
But that was the vision behind Glass, and that's why we've created this form factor.
You saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there.
They were all wearing Glass, and that's how we got that footage.
And also you want something that frees your eyes.
You could take the money you're spending on those unnecessary things and give it to this organization, the Against Malaria Foundation, which would take the money you had given and use it to buy nets like this one to protect children like this one, and we know reliably that if we provide nets, they're used, and they reduce the number of children dying from malaria,
just one of the many preventable diseases that are responsible for some of those 19,000 children dying every day.
Fortunately, more and more people are understanding this idea, and the result is a growing movement: effective altruism.
The heart, of course, you felt.
You felt the empathy for that child.
But it's really important to use the head as well to make sure that what you do is effective and well-directed, and not only that, but also I think reason helps us to understand that other people, wherever they are, are like us, that they can suffer as we can, that parents grieve for the deaths of their children, as we do, and that just as our lives and our well-being matter to us,
And Holly Morgan told me that she used to battle depression until she got involved with effective altruism, and now is one of the happiest people she knows.
I think one of the reasons for this is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome what I call the Sisyphus problem.
Here's Sisyphus as portrayed by Titian, condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder up to the top of the hill.
So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam.
I slept on the floor and I ate takeout, and I asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life-changing moment.
Their stories became the art as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas.
The last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place.
So I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out, then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles, then assembled the videos into the larger image.
So the end image was never visible as a physical whole.
How will we sell design services?
What would it mean for democratic societies to offer their citizens a right to build?
And in a way it should be kind of obvious, right, that in the 21st century, maybe cities can be developed by citizens.
And the idea is to make it possible for anyone to go online, access a freely shared library of 3D models which they can download and adapt in, at the moment, SketchUp, because it's free, and it's easy to use, and almost at the click of a switch they can generate a set of cutting files which allow them, in effect, to print out the parts from a house using a CNC machine
and a standard sheet material like plywood.
And the parts are all numbered, and basically what you end up with is a really big IKEA kit.
People get confused between construction work and having fun.
But the principles of openness go right down into the really mundane, physical details.
Like, never designing a piece that can't be lifted up.

I hope next time you see it, you won't even be able to see the map.
We're aware that WikiHouse is a very, very small answer, but it's a small answer to a really, really big question, which is that globally, right now, the fastest-growing cities are not skyscraper cities.
They're self-made cities in one form or another.
Now, I use my music to reach people's hearts and have found there are no boundaries.
My audience is anyone who is here to listen, even those who are not familiar with classical music.
I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center, but also hospitals, churches, prisons, and restricted facilities for leprosy patients, just to mention a few.
I think, while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician, I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined.
But it's now your turn.
Changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world.
They have social knits that are very close.
Or maybe it's actually because we're bound by deep time, because elephants, like us, share their origins in Africa some seven million years ago, and as habitats changed and environments changed, we actually, like the elephants, migrated out into Europe and Asia.
So the first large mammoth that appears on the scene is meridionalis, which was standing four meters tall weighing about 10 tons, and was a woodland-adapted species and spread from Western Europe clear across Central Asia, across the Bering land bridge and into parts of North America.
Not surprising then again that a mammoth preserved in the permafrost will have something on the order of 50 percent of its DNA being mammoth, whereas something like the Columbian mammoth, living in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment over its laying-in will only have 3 to 10 percent endogenous.
But we've come up with very clever ways that we can actually discriminate, capture and discriminate, the mammoth from the non-mammoth DNA, and with the advances in high-throughput sequencing, we can actually pull out and bioinformatically re-jig all these small mammoth fragments and place them onto a backbone of an Asian or African elephant chromosome.
And so by doing that, we can actually get all the little points that discriminate between a mammoth and an Asian elephant, and what do we know, then, about a mammoth?
That's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design, and the age of design is the age in which design is still cute furniture, is still posters, is still fast cars, what you see at MoMA today.
But in truth, what I really would like to explain to the public and to the audiences of MoMA is that the most interesting chairs are the ones that are actually made by a robot, like this beautiful chair by Dirk Vander Kooij, where a robot deposits a toothpaste-like slur of recycled refrigerator parts, as if he were a big candy, and makes a chair out of it.
Or good design is digital fonts that we use all the time and that become part of our identity.
These were some of the first acquisitions that really introduced the idea of interaction design to the public.
But more recently, I've been trying really to go even deeper into interaction design with examples that are emotionally really suggestive and that really explain interaction design at a level that is almost undeniable.
The Wind Map, by Wattenberg and Fernanda Viégas, I don't know if you've ever seen it -- it's really fantastic.
Did I ever say they were art? I was talking about interaction design. Excuse me.
"Exhibiting Pac-Man and Tetris alongside Picasso and Van Gogh" -- They're two floors away.  — "will mean game over for any real understanding of art."
I'm bringing in the end of the world. You know?
So it's so fantastic to see how these feathers that were ruffled, and these reactions, were so vehement.
And you know what?
The International Cat Video Film Festival didn't have that much of a reaction.  I think this was truly fantastic.
Even in the 1930s, my colleagues that were trying to put together an abstract art show had all of these works stopped by the customs officers that decided they were not art.
So it's happened before, and it will happen in the future, but right now I can tell you that I am so, so proud to be able to call Pac-Man part of the MoMA collection.
And the same with, for instance, Tetris, original version, the Soviet one.
I mean, we're talking about an experience that of course can seem weird to many, but that is very educational.
Of course, there are games that are even more educational.
Dwarf Fortress is like the holy grail of this kind of massive multiplayer online game, and in fact the two Adams brothers were in Reykjavík, and they were greeted by a standing ovation by all the Eve Online fans.
Along the way, I've had to burn a few chairs. You know?
I've had to do away with a few concepts of design past.
But I see that people are coming along, that the audiences, paradoxically, are much more responsive and much more understanding of this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are.


I'm going to share with you a paradigm-shifting perspective on the issues of gender violence -- sexual assault, domestic violence, relationship abuse, sexual harassment, sexual abuse of children.
Right? A lot of men hear the term "women's issues" and we tend to tune it out, and we think, "Hey, I'm a guy. That's for the girls," or "That's for the women."
And a lot of men literally don't get beyond the first sentence as a result.
It's almost like a chip in our brain is activated, and the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction when we hear the term "women's issues."
And actually, let me illustrate that confusion by way of analogy.
So let's talk for a moment about race.
In the U.S., when we hear the word "race," a lot of people think that means African-American, Latino, Asian-American, Native American, South Asian, Pacific Islander, on and on.
So let's talk for a moment about race.
In the U.S., when we hear the word "race," a lot of people think that means African-American, Latino, Asian-American, Native American, South Asian, Pacific Islander, on and on.
A lot of people, when they hear the word "sexual orientation" think it means gay, lesbian, bisexual.
So what are we waiting for?
Well, in most places, utility regulation hasn't changed much since Thomas Edison.
Utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy.
It was easier to get cannabis, heroin and cocaine, faster even, in the prison than outside the prison.
Evil in the society is an extreme disease.
If you have extreme diseases, you need to get extreme remedies.
And sound can actually be felt in the water, because the acoustic impedance of tissue and water's about the same.
So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance.
Now, we do know some things about how sounds are used with certain behaviors.
So I've got the rope, I'm diving down, and I'm basically trying to get the dolphin's attention, because they're kind of like little kids.
You have to keep their attention.
I'm going to drop the rope, see if they come over.
And this sometimes went on for hours.
And I wanted to share this video with you not to show you any big breakthroughs, because they haven't happened yet, but to show you the level of intention and focus that these dolphins have, and interest in the system.
And because of this, we really decided we needed some more sophisticated technology.
We're going to hook Siri up to Watson and use that to automate a lot of the work that's currently done by customer service reps and troubleshooters and diagnosers, and we're already taking R2D2, painting him orange, and putting him to work carrying shelves around warehouses, which means we need a lot fewer people to be walking up and down those aisles.
Now, for about 200 years, people have been saying exactly what I'm telling you -- the age of technological unemployment is at hand — starting with the Luddites smashing looms in Britain just about two centuries ago, and they have been wrong.
Our economies in the developed world have coasted along on something pretty close to full employment.

Our economies in the developed world have coasted along on something pretty close to full employment.
Which brings up a critical question: Why is this time different, if it really is?
They're also true no matter which ethnic group or demographic group we look at, and they're actually getting so severe that they're in danger of overwhelming even the amazing progress we made with the Civil Rights Movement.
And what my friends in Silicon Valley and Cambridge are overlooking is that they're Ted.
They're living these amazingly busy, productive lives, and they've got all the benefits to show from that, while Bill is leading a very different life.
I don't know what the playbook is for getting Bill to engage and stay engaged throughout life.
I do know that education is a huge part of it.
I witnessed this firsthand.
I made a film that was impossible to make, but I didn't know it was impossible, and that's how I was able to do it.
"Mars et Avril" is a science fiction film.
It's set in Montreal some 50 years in the future.
This guy had been lead compositor on such films as "Avatar" and "Star Trek" and "Transformers," and other unknown projects like this, and I knew he was the perfect fit for the job, and I had to convince him, and, instead of working on the next Spielberg movie, he accepted to work on mine.
Why? Because I offered him a space to dream.
So if you don't have money to offer to people, you must strike their imagination with something as nice as you can think of.
And then there's this one: "if there's grass on the field, play ball."
And that usually refers to if a young person, specifically often a young woman, is old enough to have pubic hair, she's old enough to have sex with.
This baseball model is incredibly problematic.
And that usually refers to if a young person, specifically often a young woman, is old enough to have pubic hair, she's old enough to have sex with.
This baseball model is incredibly problematic.
It's sexist. It's heterosexist.
This baseball model is incredibly problematic.
It's sexist. It's heterosexist.
It's competitive. It's goal-directed.
And it can't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults.
So we need a new model.
I'm here today to offer you that new model.
Well, you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza.
It starts with an internal sense, an internal desire, or a need.
"Huh. I could go for some pizza."
And you also can't get to second base and say, "I like it here. I'm going to stay here."
No.
And also, of course, with baseball, there's, like, the specific equipment and a specific skill set.
And we get to decide when we feel satisfied.
If we're still hungry, we might have some more.
If you eat too much, though, you just feel gross.
This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics.
We've got a conveyor there.
And if the lighting isn't too extreme -- Ah, ah! There it is. It's picked up the object off the conveyor.
By the way, what's going on with the eyes?
The eyes are on the screen there.
The eyes look ahead where the robot's going to move.
The eyes are on the screen there.
The eyes look ahead where the robot's going to move.
So a person that's interacting with the robot understands where it's going to reach and isn't surprised by its motions.
He comes over here, and he gets the fingers to grasp together, and the robot infers, ah, you want an object for me to pick up.
That puts the green icon there.
He's going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from.

This is Mildred.
Mildred's a factory worker in Connecticut.
She's worked on the line for over 20 years.
She's worked on the line for over 20 years.
One hour after she saw her first industrial robot, she had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory.
She decided she really liked robots.
Suppose that we want this quad to not only hover but to also balance this pole.
With a little bit of practice, it's pretty straightforward for a human being to do this, although we do have the advantage of having two feet on the ground and the use of our very versatile hands.
It becomes a little bit more difficult when I only have one foot on the ground and when I don't use my hands.
How did we design the algorithms to do this?
We added the mathematical model of the pole to that of the quad.
Once we have a model of the combined quad-pole system, we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it.

The second is that the propellers are all pointing in the same direction of the glass, pointing up.
You put these two things together, the net result is that all side forces on the glass are small and are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects, which at these speeds are negligible.
And that's why you don't need to model the glass.
We can't help but hold our breath when we watch a diver somersaulting into the water, or when a vaulter is twisting in the air, the ground fast approaching.
Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry?
Will the vaulter stick the landing?
This quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple, so not too large.
The following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds, or 50 times per second.
We first figure out where the ball is going.
Everything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities.
What happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being?
What I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor mainly used in gaming.
It can recognize what my various body parts are doing in real time.
Similar to the pointer that I used earlier, we can use this as inputs to the system.
We now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures.

Interaction doesn't have to be virtual. It can be physical.
Take this quad, for example.

It's trying to stay at a fixed point in space.
Interaction doesn't have to be virtual. It can be physical.
Take this quad, for example.
It's trying to stay at a fixed point in space.
We can change this behavior, however.
We can use mathematical models to estimate the force that I'm applying to the quad.
Once we know this force, we can also change the laws of physics, as far as the quad is concerned, of course.
Then one night, military trucks drive up to our house.
Soldiers storm the door.
They find me up on the top terrace.
This temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the U.S. military, but that directive needs to be made permanent.
And it could set the stage for global action.
Because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons.
A courageous woman, her name is Najla Hariri, she's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah, she drove a car and she announced but she didn't record a video.
We needed proof.
So I drove. I posted a video on YouTube.
Arrested again, he was sent to detention for one day, and I was sent to jail.
I wasn't sure why I was sent there, because I didn't face any charges in the interrogation.
But what I was sure of was my innocence.
So if you look at the map of the world, that only leaves two countries: Saudi Arabia, and the other society is the rest of the world.
We started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study, and it made headlines around the world.
[BBC News: 'End of virginity' if women drive, Saudi cleric warns]  And only then we realized it's so empowering to mock your oppressor.
It strips it away of its strongest weapon: fear.
This system is based on ultra-conservative traditions and customs that deal with women as if they are inferior and they need a guardian to protect them, so they need to take permission from this guardian, whether verbal or written, all their lives.
We are minors until the day we die.
I was asked last year to give a speech at the Oslo Freedom Forum.
I was surrounded by this love and the support of people around me, and they looked at me as an inspiration.
At the same time, I flew back to my home country, they hated that speech so much.
There were people like that, I just showed some examples, who are amazing, who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia, and trying, and they are also facing a lot of hate because of speaking up and voicing their views.
Saudi Arabia today is taking small steps toward enhancing women's rights.
The Shura Council that's appointed by the king, by royal decree of King Abdullah, last year there were 30 women assigned to that Council, like 20 percent.
They told me, "Didier, yeah, the market might be overvalued, but you forget something.
There is the Beijing Olympic Games coming in August 2008, and it's very clear that the Chinese government is controlling the economy and doing what it takes to also avoid any wave and control the stock market."
Three weeks after my presentation, the markets lost 20 percent and went through a phase of volatility, upheaval, and a total market loss of 70 percent until the end of the year.
The idea is the following. We monitor the markets.
We identify excesses, bubbles.
We do our work. We write a report in which we put our prediction of the critical time.
Housing for Health works with poor people.
It works in the places where they live, and the work is done to improve their health.
Over the last 28 years, this tough, grinding, dirty work has been done by literally thousands of people around Australia and, more recently, overseas, and their work has proven that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments.
We call up the doctor of dust, and there is such a person.
He was loaned to us by a mining company.
He controls dust on mining company sites.
Health was poor.
We went in with no grand plan, no grand promises of a great program, just the offer to build two toilets for two families.
It was during the design of the first toilet that I went for lunch, invited by the family into their main room of the house.
All the while, we also wanted to give back to the local tech community that helped us grow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days.
And that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi, an actual physical space where we could collaborate, and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya.
We did that with the support of different organizations like the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network.
That chicken wing changed my life.
Hope is personal. Hope is something that no one can give to you.
You have to choose to believe in hope.
Hope is personal. Hope is something that no one can give to you.
You have to choose to believe in hope.
You have to make it yourself.
We do our best to ignore the fact that we don't always have it, and that not everything can be explained.
Yet whether you're a rationalist or a mystic, whether you think the words Muhammad heard that night came from inside himself or from outside, what's clear is that he did experience them, and that he did so with a force that would shatter his sense of himself and his world and transform this otherwise modest man into a radical advocate for social and economic justice.
Fear was the only sane response, the only human response.
We have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers.
It's difficult and stubborn.
It involves an ongoing struggle, a continual questioning of what we think we know, a wrestling with issues and ideas.
After keeping company with him as a writer for the past five years, I can't see that he'd be anything but utterly outraged at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak and act in his name in the Middle East and elsewhere today.
He'd be appalled at the repression of half the population because of their gender.
He'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism.
And the recurrent theme that I encounter all the time is people say, "Well, you know, the people who do see, they're whistleblowers, and we all know what happens to them."
So there's this profound mythology around whistleblowers which says, first of all, they're all crazy.
But what I've found going around the world and talking to whistleblowers is, actually, they're very loyal and quite often very conservative people.
And she said to me, she said, "You know, Margaret, I always used to say I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grow up.
But I've found myself in this cause, and I'll never be the same."
We all enjoy so many freedoms today, hard-won freedoms: the freedom to write and publish without fear of censorship, a freedom that wasn't here the last time I came to Hungary; a freedom to vote, which women in particular had to fight so hard for; the freedom for people of different ethnicities and cultures and sexual orientation to live the way that they want.
I can collaborate with my opponents to become better at what I do.
These are people of immense persistence, incredible patience, and an absolute determination not to be blind and not to be silent.
When I went to Libby, Montana, I visited the asbestosis clinic that Gayla Benefield brought into being, a place where at first some of the people who wanted help and needed medical attention went in the back door because they didn't want to acknowledge that she'd been right.
I said, "She's not a movie star, and she's not a celebrity, and she's not an expert, and Gayla's the first person who'd say she's not a saint.
The really important thing about Gayla is she is ordinary.
She's like you, and she's like me.
You treat the obesity.
But what if we have it backwards?
What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all?
In fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem, the tip of a proverbial iceberg?
I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out.
What if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell?
You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity of our cells to partition fuel, as I alluded to a moment ago, taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately.
When we become insulin-resistant, the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state.
So now, when insulin says to a cell, I want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says, "No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy."
Just because you know what to do doesn't mean you're always going to do it.
Sometimes we have to put cues around people to make it easier, and believe it or not, that can be studied scientifically.
I don't know how this journey is going to end, but this much seems clear to me, at least: We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like I did.
"Discouraging data on the antidepressant."
Indeed, it is discouraging.
Now, you would think, well, look, most of you laughed at that.
Now, you would think, well, look, most of you laughed at that.
Right? You thought it was funny.
In general, that seems like a funny cartoon, but let's look what online survey I did.
Right? You thought it was funny.
In general, that seems like a funny cartoon, but let's look what online survey I did.
Generally, about 85 percent of the people liked it.
We haven't announced this publicly before.
We're excited. We've got to get past this point.
We now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate, to turn in so that it will produce the other tissues.
Thank you.  We haven't done it yet, but keep the applause ready.
The second project I want to talk to you about is the Thylacine Project.
The thylacine looks a bit, to most people, like a dog, or maybe like a tiger, because it has stripes.
The second project I want to talk to you about is the Thylacine Project.
The thylacine looks a bit, to most people, like a dog, or maybe like a tiger, because it has stripes.
But it's not related to any of those. It's a marsupial.
By the early 1930s, 3,000 to 4,000 thylacines had been murdered.
It was a disaster, and they were about to hit the wall.
Have a look at this bit of film footage.
By the early 1930s, 3,000 to 4,000 thylacines had been murdered.
It was a disaster, and they were about to hit the wall.
Have a look at this bit of film footage.
In 1990, I was in the Australian Museum.
I was fascinated by thylacines. I've always been obsessed with these animals.
And I was studying skulls, trying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals, and I saw this jar, and here, in the jar, was a little girl thylacine pup, perhaps six months old.
No, it's not. These are marsupials.
They give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean.
That Tasmanian devil's not even going to know it gave birth.
It is, shortly, going to think it's got the ugliest Tasmanian devil baby in the world, so maybe it'll need some help to keep it going.
Andrew Pask and his colleagues have demonstrated this might not be a waste of time.
And it's sort of in the future, we haven't got there yet, but it's the kind of thing we want to think about.
And it's sort of in the future, we haven't got there yet, but it's the kind of thing we want to think about.
They took some of this same pickled thylacine DNA and they spliced it into a mouse genome, but they put a tag on it so that anything that this thylacine DNA produced would appear blue-green in the mouse baby.
In other words, if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine DNA, it would be able to be recognized.
If the only nuclear DNA that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA, that's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil.
OK, if we can do this, could we put it back?
This is a key question for everybody.
OK, if we can do this, could we put it back?
This is a key question for everybody.
Does it have to stay in a laboratory, or could we put it back where it belongs?
That, of course, was the meta-narrative distilled from the theories of Karl Marx.
And the Chinese bought it.
We were taught that grand story day in and day out.
Paradise on Earth, again.
Sooner or later, electoral democracy will be the only political system for all countries and all peoples, with a free market to make them all rich.
But before we get there, we're engaged in a struggle between good and evil.
The opposites are true.
Adaptability, meritocracy, and legitimacy are the three defining characteristics of China's one-party system.
Now, most political scientists will tell us that a one-party system is inherently incapable of self-correction.
But a more careful look would tell us otherwise.
Transparency International ranks China between 70 and 80 in recent years among 170 countries, and it's been moving up. India, the largest democracy in the world, 94 and dropping.
For the hundred or so countries that are ranked below China, more than half of them are electoral democracies.
It is the universal claim that many Western elites are making about their political system, the hubris, that is at the heart of the West's current ills. If they would spend just a little less time they might give their democracy a better chance.
China's political model will never supplant electoral democracy, because unlike the latter, it doesn't pretend to be universal.
It cannot be exported. But that is the point precisely.
I think many here, and in general in Western countries, would agree with your statement about analysis of democratic systems becoming dysfunctional, but at the same time, many would kind of find unsettling the thought that there is an unelected authority that, without any form of oversight or consultation, decides what the national interest is.
What is the mechanism in the Chinese model that allows people to say, actually, the national interest as you defined it is wrong?
EXL: You know, Frank Fukuyama, the political scientist, called the Chinese system "responsive authoritarianism."
It's cloud based, and it doesn't require any training, programming, consultants.
But there are some additional benefits as well.
Now we knew when we built this system, the whole point of it, just like with the PalmPilots, was that you'd be able to collect the data and immediately upload the data and get your data set.
Cloud based, no training, no consultants, no me.
And I told you that in the first few years of trying to do this the old-fashioned way, going out to each country, we probably trained about 1,000 people.
What happened after we did this?
Those are common clouds.
What about rarer ones, like the lenticularis, the UFO-shaped lenticularis cloud?
These clouds form in the region of mountains.
If you close your eyes and think of a cloud, it's probably one of these that comes to mind.
All those cloud shapes at the beginning, those were cumulus clouds.
The sharp, crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in.
The sharp, crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in.
And it reminds us of the aimless nature of cloudspotting, what an aimless activity it is.
You're not going to change the world by lying on your back and gazing up at the sky, are you?
We're so excited to be here. It's such an honor for us.
Like he said, we're three brothers from New Jersey -- you know, the bluegrass capital of the world.
We discovered bluegrass a few years ago, and we fell in love with it. We hope you guys will too.
The issue is that this is set to engender an environmental problem that is without precedent.
Before going further, let me give you a crash course in plant biology.
So, what does a plant need in order to grow?
The energy in all living things, ATP, is phosphorus-based.
And more importantly still, phosphorus is a key component of DNA, something everyone is familiar with, and which is shown in this image.
DNA is our genetic heritage.
DNA is our genetic heritage.
It is extremely important, and once again, phosphorus is a key player.
Now, where do we find this phosphorus?
Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus.
And because in order to get 15 percent of it to the plant, all the rest is lost, we have to add more and more.
Now, where will we get this phosphorus from?
Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost.
The solution I'm offering today is one that has existed for a very long time, even before plants existed on Earth, and it's a microscopic mushroom that is very mysterious, very simple, and yet also extremely complex.
I've been fascinated by this little mushroom for over 16 years now.
This slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza.
You’re looking at the root of wheat, one of the world’s most important plants.
Normally, a root will find phosphorus all by itself.

Normally, a root will find phosphorus all by itself.
It will go in search of phosphorus, but only within the one millimeter which surrounds it.
Beyond one millimeter, the root is ineffective.
It grows much faster, and is much better designed to seek out phosphorus.
It can go beyond the root’s one-millimeter scope to seek out phosphorus.
I haven’t invented anything at all; it's a biotechnology that has existed for 450 million years.
And over time, this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tiniest trace of phosphorus, and to put it to use, to make it available to the plant.
What you’re seeing here, in the real world, is a carrot root, and the mushroom with its very fine filaments.
Looking closer, we can see that this mushroom is very gentle in its penetration.
If you recall the graphs I showed you earlier, 85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil, and the plants are unable to access it.
Even though it is present in the soil, it is in insoluble form.
The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms.
Now this region, it has just five percent of its forests left intact. Five percent.
So how did that happen?
Well, because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years.
But what doesn't usually come to light is how shell companies are used to steal huge sums of money, transformational sums of money, from poor countries.
In virtually every case of corruption that we've investigated, shell companies have appeared, and sometimes it's been impossible to find out who is really involved in the deal.
A recent study by the World Bank looked at 200 cases of corruption.
In virtually every case of corruption that we've investigated, shell companies have appeared, and sometimes it's been impossible to find out who is really involved in the deal.
A recent study by the World Bank looked at 200 cases of corruption.
It found that over 70 percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies, totaling almost 56 billion dollars.
But as a campaigner and investigator, I have a different view, because I've seen what can happen when an idea gains momentum.
In the oil and mining sector, for example, there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide transparency standard that could tackle some of these problems.
In 1999, when Global Witness called for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent, well, some people laughed at the extreme naiveté of that small idea.
This is my grandfather.
And this is my son.
My grandfather taught me to work with wood when I was a little boy, and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something, honor that tree's life and make it as beautiful as you possibly can.
This is a U.S. statistic about the impact of greenhouse gases.
Almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry, and if we look at energy, it's the same story.
You'll notice that transportation's sort of second down that list, but that's the conversation we mostly hear about.
The problem I see is that, ultimately, the clash of how we solve that problem of serving those three billion people that need a home, and climate change, are a head-on collision about to happen, or already happening.
That challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways, and I think wood is going to be part of that solution, and I'm going to tell you the story of why.
As an architect, wood is the only material, big material, that I can build with that's already grown by the power of the sun.

As an architect, wood is the only material, big material, that I can build with that's already grown by the power of the sun.
When a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen and soaks up carbon dioxide, and it dies and it falls to the forest floor, it gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground.

If it burns in a forest fire, it's going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well.
Fair enough.
And the way I describe it is this.
If I asked you to take a match and light it and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire, it doesn't happen, right? We all know that.
In the 1980s, I developed an underwater keyboard.
This was a custom-made touch-screen keyboard.
What I wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control.
Now here's a little video.
This is Delphi and Pan, and you're going to see Delphi hitting a key, he hears a computer-generated whistle --  -- and gets a ball, so they can actually ask for things they want.
What was remarkable is, they explored this keyboard on their own. There was no intervention on our part.

They explored the keyboard. They played around with it.
I work with a lot of musicians from around the world, and often we don't have any common language at all, but we sit down behind our instruments, and suddenly there's a way for us to connect and emote.
So I started cold-calling, and eventually got through to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, and she invited me down.
I went down, and the bonobos had had access to percussion instruments, musical toys, but never before to a keyboard.
VC: Thank you, Neil.
A long time ago in a galaxy — oops, wrong script.
Forty years ago, Bob Kahn and I did the design of the Internet.
And to make it a bit simpler for myself, I decided to map out scientific criteria, and here it is.
Essentially, first, the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers, in the earliest stages, but also only in cancer.
And so I'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task, and finally, on the 4,000th try, when I'm close to losing my sanity, I find the protein.

And so I'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task, and finally, on the 4,000th try, when I'm close to losing my sanity, I find the protein.
And the name of the protein I'd located was called mesothelin, and it's just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill type protein, unless, of course, you have pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer, in which case it's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream.
And since they're so delicate, they need to be supported.
So that's why I chose to use paper.
Making a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple as making chocolate chip cookies, which I love.
The result?
One small paper sensor that costs three cents and takes five minutes to run.
This makes it 168 times faster, over 26,000 times less expensive, and over 400 times more sensitive than our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection.
I was walking along the shore in Alaska, and I came across this tide pool filled with a colony of sea anemones, these wonderful eating machines, relatives of coral and jellyfish.
And curious to see if any of them made any noise, I dropped a hydrophone, an underwater microphone covered in rubber, down the mouth part, and immediately the critter began to absorb the microphone into its belly, and the tentacles were searching out of the surface for something of nutritional value.
The static-like sounds that are very low, that you're going to hear right now.

The static-like sounds that are very low, that you're going to hear right now.
Yeah, but watch. When it didn't find anything to eat --   I think that's an expression that can be understood in any language.
Where you come from now is much less important than where you're going.
More and more of us are rooted in the future or the present tense as much as in the past.
And home, we know, is not just the place where you happen to be born.
And yet, there is one great problem with movement, and that is that it's really hard to get your bearings when you're in midair.
Some years ago, I noticed that I had accumulated one million miles on United Airlines alone.
You all know that crazy system, six days in hell, you get the seventh day free.

Some years ago, I noticed that I had accumulated one million miles on United Airlines alone.
You all know that crazy system, six days in hell, you get the seventh day free.
So I got in my car, and I drove three hours north along the coast, and the roads grew emptier and narrower, and then I turned onto an even narrower path, barely paved, that snaked for two miles up to the top of a mountain.
And when I got out of my car, the air was pulsing.
The whole place was absolutely silent, but the silence wasn't an absence of noise.
Movement is a fantastic privilege, and it allows us to do so much that our grandparents could never have dreamed of doing.
But movement, ultimately, only has a meaning if you have a home to go back to.
And home, in the end, is of course not just the place where you sleep.
Two: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight, which means more power.
Three: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage.
And four: Horn used to store energy in compression.

So here's the most important economic fact of our time.
We are living in an age of surging income inequality, particularly between those at the very top and everyone else.
Think about Amazon, Apple, Google, Starbucks.
These are among the world's most admired, most beloved, most innovative companies.
They also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly.
And in contrast with the industrial revolution, the titans of our new economy aren't creating that many new jobs.
At its zenith, G.M. employed hundreds of thousands, Facebook fewer than 10,000.
The same is true of globalization.
There's three particular things that I've done, and I'll just describe those first, and then talk about some of my work.
So when I was a kid, I was obsessed with wires, and I used to thread them under my carpet and thread them behind the walls and have little switches and little speakers, and I wanted to make my bedroom be interactive but kind of all hidden away.
And I was also really interested in wireless as well.
It's more that I just liked the idea of an everyday object having something inside and doing something different.
Several year later, I managed to successfully fail all of my exams and didn't really leave school with much to show for at all, and my parents, maybe as a reward, bought me what turned out to be a one-way ticket to Australia, and I came back home about four years later.
I ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere.
So I'll just describe a couple of things that we've created.
There's lots of different things we've created.
This is one of them, because I love cake.

And this one, it's a large poster, and you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it, and the poster talks to you when you touch it and asks you a series of questions, and it works out your perfect cake.

But it doesn't tell you the cake there and then.
And I am not a musician. It seemed like a good idea at the time.
If anyone wants to try and play drums, then they can.
I'll just describe how this works.

And it has really good response time.

I'm going to talk about consciousness.
Why consciousness?
Why consciousness?
Well, it's a curiously neglected subject, both in our scientific and our philosophical culture.
Now why is that curious?
So consciousness is number one.
The second reason is that when people do get interested in it, as I think they should, they tend to say the most appalling things.
And then, even when they're not saying appalling things and they're really trying to do serious research, well, it's been slow. Progress has been slow.
Okay, now why then is this curious reluctance and curious hostility to consciousness?
Well, I think it's a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they're opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions.
One feature is the tradition of religious dualism: Consciousness is not a part of the physical world.
Well, I think it's a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they're opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions.
One feature is the tradition of religious dualism: Consciousness is not a part of the physical world.
It's a part of the spiritual world.
That's the tradition of God, the soul and immortality.
There's another tradition that thinks it's opposed to this but accepts the worst assumption.
That tradition thinks that we are heavy-duty scientific materialists: Consciousness is not a part of the physical world.
And I'm going to go through some of them.
Okay, now I promised you to tell you some of the outrageous things said about consciousness.
One: Consciousness does not exist.
It's an illusion, like sunsets.
Science has shown sunsets and rainbows are illusions.
So consciousness is an illusion.
It's a computer program running in the brain.
Three: No, the only thing that exists is really behavior.
It's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was, but I'll get back to that.
Now, I haven't yet given you a definition.
You can't do this if you don't give a definition.
People always say consciousness is very hard to define.
I think it's rather easy to define if you're not trying to give a scientific definition.
We're not ready for a scientific definition, but here's a common-sense definition.
Consciousness consists of all those states of feeling or sentience or awareness.
The famous mind-body problem is that simple.
All right? But now we get into some harder questions.
Let's specify the exact features of consciousness, so that we can then answer those four objections that I made to it.
All right? But now we get into some harder questions.
Let's specify the exact features of consciousness, so that we can then answer those four objections that I made to it.
Well, the first feature is, it's real and irreducible.
You cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness.
Okay, that's the first feature of consciousness.
It's real and irreducible.
That is the key to understanding the enormous power of consciousness.
And we have not been able to do that in a robot.
The disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we don't know how to make a conscious robot, so we don't have a machine that can do this kind of thing.
How can it be that this thought in my brain can move material objects?
Well, I'll tell you the answer.
I mean, we don't know the detailed answer, but we know the basic part of the answer, and that is, there is a sequence of neuron firings, and they terminate where the acetylcholine is secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons.
Now, what that tells us is that our traditional vocabularies for discussing these issues are totally obsolete.
One and the same event has a level of description where it's mental, and that's a single event, and that's how nature works. That's how it's possible for consciousness to function causally.
Okay, now with that in mind, with going through these various features of consciousness, let's go back and answer some of those early objections.
Okay, now with that in mind, with going through these various features of consciousness, let's go back and answer some of those early objections.
Well, the first one I said was, consciousness doesn't exist, it's an illusion. Well, I've already answered that.
I don't think we need to worry about that.
I don't think we need to worry about that.
But the second one had an incredible influence, and may still be around, and that is, "Well, if consciousness exists, it's really something else.
It's really a digital computer program running in your brain and that's what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program.
You get an algorithm that you can program in a binary code, and that's the defining trait of the computer program.
But we know that that's purely syntactical. That's symbolic.
We know that actual human consciousness has something more than that.
But we know that that's purely syntactical. That's symbolic.
We know that actual human consciousness has something more than that.
It's got a content in addition to the syntax.
It's got a content in addition to the syntax.
It's got a semantics.
Now that argument, I made that argument 30 -- oh my God, I don't want to think about it — more than 30 years ago, but there's a deeper argument implicit in what I've told you, and I want to tell you that argument briefly, and that is, consciousness creates an observer-independent reality.
You can make objective claims about a domain that is subjective in its mode of existence, and indeed that's what neurologists do.
I mean, you have patients that actually suffer pains, and you try to get an objective science of that.
Okay, I promised to refute all these guys, and I don't have an awful lot of time left, but let me refute a couple more of them.
And if you look at these figures for the more developed markets like U.K., Germany, and so on, they're actually much lower.
And I find that sort of scary.
People are actually trusting businesspeople more than they're trusting governments and leaders.
So what's starting to happen, if you think about money, if you sort of boil money down to an essence, it is literally just an expression of value, an agreed value.
So what's happening now, in the digital age, is that we can quantify value in lots of different ways and do it more easily, and sometimes the way that we quantify those values, it makes it much easier to create new forms and valid forms of currency.
In that context, you can see that networks like Bitcoin suddenly start to make a bit more sense.
What do we know about the future?
Difficult question, simple answer: nothing.
We cannot predict the future.
So this airplane has no windows anymore, for example.
What about the data and communication software which we need in the future?
My belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness.
My belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness.
It will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very complex technology.
This will be very different in the future.
So this technology, 3D printing, and new design rules really help us to reduce the weight, which is the biggest issue in aircraft design, because it's directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions.
Push this idea a little bit forward.
So how does nature build its components and structures?
Underneath, I was actually deeply unhappy, insecure and fundamentally frightened -- frightened of other people, of the future, of failure and of the emptiness that I felt was within me.
But I was skilled at hiding it, and from the outside appeared to be someone with everything to hope for and aspire to.
This fantasy of invulnerability was so complete that I even deceived myself, and as the first semester ended and the second began, there was no way that anyone could have predicted what was just about to happen.
And the voice persisted, days and then weeks of it, on and on, narrating everything I did in the third person.
"She is going to the library."
"She is going to a lecture."
"She is going to a lecture."
It was neutral, impassive and even, after a while, strangely companionate and reassuring, although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion.
So, for example, if I was angry and had to hide it, which I often did, being very adept at concealing how I really felt, then the voice would sound frustrated.
Now it's down on my medical records that Eleanor has delusions that she's a television news broadcaster.
It was at this point that events began to rapidly overtake me.
A hospital admission followed, the first of many, a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next, and then, worst of all, a toxic, tormenting sense of hopelessness, humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects.
They told me, for example, that if I proved myself worthy of their help, then they could change my life back to how it had been, and a series of increasingly bizarre tasks was set, a kind of labor of Hercules.
It started off quite small, for example, pull out three strands of hair, but gradually it grew more extreme, culminating in commands to harm myself, and a particularly dramatic instruction: "You see that tutor over there?
You see that glass of water?
But a later response, and much more useful, would be to try and deconstruct the message behind the words, so when the voices warned me not to leave the house, then I would thank them for drawing my attention to how unsafe I felt -- because if I was aware of it, then I could do something positive about it -- but go on to reassure both them and myself that we were safe and didn't need to feel frightened anymore.
I would set boundaries for the voices, and try to interact with them in a way that was assertive yet respectful, establishing a slow process of communication and collaboration in which we could learn to work together and support one another.
Throughout all of this, what I would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself, and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that I'd never had an opportunity to process or resolve, memories of sexual trauma and abuse, of anger, shame, guilt, low self-worth.
And I remember the most moving and extraordinary moment when supporting another young woman who was terrorized by her voices, and becoming fully aware, for the very first time, that I no longer felt that way myself but was finally able to help someone else who was.
I'm now very proud to be a part of Intervoice, the organizational body of the International Hearing Voices Movement, an initiative inspired by the work of Professor Marius Romme and Dr. Sandra Escher, which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy, a sane reaction to insane circumstances, not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured, but a complex, significant and meaningful experience to be explored.
Together, we envisage and enact a society that understands and respects voice hearing, supports the needs of individuals who hear voices, and which values them as full citizens.

There was no money involved.
It wasn't going to be written down. It was no news.
And there were these incredible artists that felt for me like an eternity as they performed.
Three strokes, you get the whole bamboo forest.
I go to the concept of "The Lion King" and I say, "What is the essence of it?
What is the abstraction?
So I could go from -- For instance, I'll show you some "Spider-Man" later, these incredible machines that move people along.
But the fact is, without the dancer who knows how to use his body and swing on those wires, it's nothing.
So now I'm going to show you some clips from the other big project of my life this year, "The Tempest."
But the fact is, without the dancer who knows how to use his body and swing on those wires, it's nothing.
So now I'm going to show you some clips from the other big project of my life this year, "The Tempest."
It's a movie. I did "The Tempest" on a stage three times in the theater since 1984, '86, and I love the play.
Prospera: We are such stuff as dreams are made on.
and our little life is rounded with a sleep.
JT: Okay.
and our little life is rounded with a sleep.
JT: Okay.
So I went from theater, doing "The Tempest" on the stage in a very low-budget production many years ago, and I love the play, and I also think it's Shakespeare's last play, and it really lends itself, as you can see, to cinema.
What, if I were to boil it down, would be the one image that I could hang my hat on for this?
And it was the sand castle, the idea of nurture versus nature, that we build these civilizations -- she speaks about it at the end, Helen Mirren's Prospera -- we build them, but under nature, under the grand tempest, these cloud-capped towers, these gorgeous palaces will fade and there will -- leave not a rack behind.
So in the theater, I started the play, it was a black sand rake, white cyc, and there was a little girl, Miranda, on the horizon, building a drip castle, a sand castle.

So in the theater, I started the play, it was a black sand rake, white cyc, and there was a little girl, Miranda, on the horizon, building a drip castle, a sand castle.
And as she was there on the edge of that stage, two stagehands all in black with watering cans ran along the top and started to pour water on the sand castle, and the sand castle started to drip and sink, but before it did, the audience saw the black-clad stagehands.

And we climbed up and we got to the very top, and we're on the edge, on this precipice, Roland disappears into the sulfur smoke at the volcano at the other end, and I'm up there alone on this incredible precipice.
Did you hear the lyrics?
I'm on the precipice looking down into a dead volcano to my left.


Motor racing is a funny old business.
So there's about 25,000 things there that can go wrong.
So motor racing is very much about attention to detail.
The other thing about Formula 1 in particular is we're always changing the car.
So how do we do that?
Well, we start our life with the racing car.
We have a lot of sensors on the car to measure things.
So we have a very ambitious program.
We think that the race is on to do something differently.
We are thinking big. It's the right thing to do.
We have an approach which, if it's successful, there's no reason why it should stay within a hospital.
It can go beyond the walls.
With wireless connectivity these days, there is no reason why patients, doctors and nurses always have to be in the same place at the same time.
Despite all that, I tried to understand him.
I didn't want to judge him with the same cruelty that he judged me.

It's not a language for science, research, a language we're used to in universities, a language we use in the workplace, a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project, and it definitely isn't a language we use at the airport.
If we did so, they'd strip us of our clothes.
This is a reality that developed societies are aware of.
The Germans, French, Japanese and Chinese, all these nations are aware of this.
That's why they legislate to protect their language.

Do we know better than them?
All right, we aren't from the developed world, this advanced thinking hasn't reached us yet, and we would like to catch up with the civilized world.
Countries that were once like us, but decided to strive for development, do research, and catch up with those countries, such as Turkey, Malaysia and others, they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder, protected it like a diamond.

Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it's not labeled in Turkish, then it isn't a local product.
Let's start from this moment.
Let's write a novel or produce a short film.
A single novel could make us global again.
So there's things you can't do, and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me, because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world, but they're sketches at best, which is what's annoyed me.
If only, if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it.
So I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine.
And I'm going to show you what it can do.
And before I start making noises with it, and using it to manipulate my voice, I want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear is being made by my voice.
This system has -- thank you, beautiful assistant -- this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it, so there's no prerecorded samples of any kind.

But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd?
Impossible, you say. No.
That's not a very helpful model for arguing, but it's a pretty common and entrenched model for arguing.
But there's a second model for arguing: arguments as proofs.
Think of a mathematician's argument.
In order to do that, well -- I don't know how to do that.
That's the bad news.
The argument-as-war metaphor is just ... it's a monster.

Chris is a great friend of mine from my university days, but secretly, I hate him.
Here's why. Back in university, we had a quick project to design some solar-powered clocks.
Here's my clock.
In fact, in the years that I gathered data, only one experience came close to being the perfect one.
That is, of course, sex. Great sex.
Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level.
The different types of writing in Africa, first was proto-writing, as illustrated by Nsibidi, which is the writing system of a secret society of the Ejagham people in southern Nigeria.
So it's a special-interest writing system.
The Akan of people of Ghana and [Cote d'Ivoire] developed Adinkra symbols some 400 years ago, and these are proverbs, historical sayings, objects, animals, plants, and my favorite Adinkra system is the first one at the top on the left.
And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe, you know, in his brain something was stirring, some sort of musical gift.
Here's a little picture of Derek going up now, when you were with your nanny.
Now Nanny's great other insight was to think, perhaps we should get Derek something to play, and sure enough, she dragged this little keyboard out of the loft, never thinking really that anything much would come of it.

AO: Fantastic. Well done, Derek.
So you see, in your brain, Derek, is this amazing musical computer that can instantly recalibrate, recalculate, all the pieces in the world that are out there.
Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said, "Sorry, do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee' in B minor instead of A minor?" as we went on.
Because we were part of the exhibition, even if my friend wanted to see me, they had to buy a ticket to see me.
That was the problem.
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.
Finally the priest, finally he trusted me to rebuild.
He said, "As long as you collect money by yourself, bring your students to build, you can do it."
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.

It was meant to stay there for three years, but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.
Then, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake, and we proposed to donate this church, so we dismantled them, we sent them over to be built by volunteer people.
It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now.
So this building became a permanent building.
Then I wonder, what is a permanent and what is a temporary building?


What I'd like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects, and that is the neuroscience of sleep.
If you're an average sort of person, 36 percent of your life will be spent asleep, which means that if you live to 90, then 32 years will have been spent entirely asleep.
Now what that 32 years is telling us is that sleep at some level is important.
And yet, for most of us, we don't give sleep a second thought.
And of course the infamous -- what was his name? -- the infamous Gordon Gekko from "Wall Street" said, "Money never sleeps."
What do we do in the 20th century about sleep?
Well, of course, we use Thomas Edison's light bulb to invade the night, and we occupied the dark, and in the process of this occupation, we've treated sleep as an illness, almost.
Actually, sleep is an incredibly important part of our biology, and neuroscientists are beginning to explain why it's so very important.
So let's move to the brain.
Now, here we have a brain.

This is donated by a social scientist, and they said they didn't know what it was or indeed, how to use it, so --  Sorry.
The brain stem then projects forward and bathes the cortex, this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here, with neurotransmitters that keep us awake and essentially provide us with our consciousness.
So sleep arises from a whole raft of different interactions within the brain, and essentially, sleep is turned on and off as a result of a range of interactions in here.
OK. So where have we got to?
So sleep and memory consolidation is also very important.
However, it's not just the laying down of memory and recalling it.
What's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep.
And what seems to be going on is that, in the brain, those neural connections that are important, those synaptic connections that are important, are linked and strengthened, while those that are less important tend to fade away and be less important.
OK. So we've had three explanations for why we might sleep, and I think the important thing to realize is that the details will vary, and it's probable we sleep for multiple different reasons.
But sleep is not an indulgence.
It's simply not enough.
If we think about other sectors of society -- the aged; if you are aged, then your ability to sleep in a single block is somewhat disrupted, and many sleep, again, less than five hours a night.
Shift work. Shift work is extraordinary, perhaps 20 percent of the working population, and the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night.
What do we do about that when I'm feeling completely wired?"
Well, of course, you then resort to alcohol.
Now alcohol, short-term, you know, once or twice, to use to mildly sedate you, can be very useful.
It can actually ease the sleep transition.
But what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep.
A biological mimic for sleep, it sedates you.
But what you must be so aware of is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep.
A biological mimic for sleep, it sedates you.
So it actually harms some of the neural processing that's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall.
Another connection between loss of sleep is weight gain.
If you sleep around about five hours or less every night, then you have a 50 percent likelihood of being obese.
What's the connection here?
If you sleep around about five hours or less every night, then you have a 50 percent likelihood of being obese.
What's the connection here?
Well, sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin, Ghrelin is released. It gets to the brain.
What do you do?
Well -- and this is slightly offensive -- sleep for dummies.
Make your bedroom a haven for sleep.

Australians, we don't mind a bit of a drink, sometimes to excess, leading to embarrassing social situations.  This is my father's work Christmas party, December 1973.
I'm almost five years old. Fair to say, I'm enjoying the day a lot more than Santa was.
But I stand before you today not as a breakfast radio host, not as a comedian, but as someone who was, is, and always will be a mathematician.
I thought about it for a nanosecond.
I took one look at the road map of life, and I ran off down the street marked "Geek" as fast as my chubby, asthmatic little legs would carry me.
I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages.
Put simply, in a room full of randomly selected people, I'm a maths genius.
In a roomful of maths Ph.Ds, I'm as dumb as a box of hammers.
My skill is not in the mathematics.
It's because of Curtis Cooper that we know, currently the largest prime number we know, is 2 ^ 57,885,161.
Don't forget to subtract the one.
This number is almost 17 and a half million digits long.
If, when TED had begun, at 11 o'clock on Tuesday, we'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second, it would have taken five hours to show you that number.
I was keen to do it, could not convince Bono.
That's the way it goes.
In our beautiful, indigenous sport of Australian football, they won the equivalent of the Super Bowl.
I was there. It was the most emotional, exciting day.
It wasn't my highlight of 2012.
No, it wasn't. The highlight of 2012, so clearly, was the discovery of the Higgs boson.
Give it up for the fundamental particle that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass.
And what was so gorgeous about this discovery was 50 years ago Peter Higgs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions: How is it that the things that make us up have no mass?
It's beyond our reach."
And within just 50 years, in his lifetime, with him sitting in the audience, we had designed the greatest machine ever to prove this incredible idea that originated just in a human mind.
That's what is so exciting for me about this prime number.
But for every disaster we had, the marathon found ways to bring people together.
In 2005, our prime minister was assassinated, and the country came to a complete standstill, so we organized a five-kilometer United We Run campaign.
Over 60,000 people came to the start line, all wearing white T-shirts with no political slogans.
Government protesters became sideline cheerleaders.
They even hosted juice stations.
You know, the marathon has really become one of its kind.
SR: So what was going on in my brain while I was recalling the memory of an ex?
If you were to just completely ignore human ethics for a second and slice up my brain right now, you would see that there was an amazing number of brain regions that were active while recalling that memory.
Now one brain region that would be robustly active in particular is called the hippocampus, which for decades has been implicated in processing the kinds of memories that we hold near and dear, which also makes it an ideal target to go into and to try and find and maybe reactivate a memory.
You're actually looking at the cross-section of a memory right now.
XL: Now, for the switch we have been talking about, ideally, the switch has to act really fast.
It shouldn't take minutes or hours to work.
Now with our system, the cells that are active in the hippocampus in the making of this memory, only those cells will now contain channelrhodopsin.
XL: When you are as small as a mouse, it feels as if the whole world is trying to get you.
So your best response of defense is trying to be undetected.
XL: When you are as small as a mouse, it feels as if the whole world is trying to get you.
So your best response of defense is trying to be undetected.
Whenever a mouse is in fear, it will show this very typical behavior by staying at one corner of the box, trying to not move any part of its body, and this posture is called freezing.
Do I shake their hand? Do I turn around and run away?
Do I sit here and pretend like I don't exist?"
Those kinds of fleeting thoughts that physically incapacitate you, that temporarily give you that deer-in-headlights look.
Now Xu and I, on the other hand, were in a completely windowless black room not making any ocular movement that even remotely resembles an eye blink because our eyes were fixed onto a computer screen.
We were looking at this mouse here trying to activate a memory for the first time using our technique.
XL: And this is what we saw.
They want to know, what's going on in this new box?
It's interesting.
But the moment we turned on the laser, like you see now, all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode.
Ever since the publication of our work, we've been receiving numerous comments from all over the Internet.
Maybe we can take a look at some of those.
["OMGGGGG FINALLY... so much more to come, virtual reality, neural manipulation, visual dream emulation... neural coding, 'writing and re-writing of memories', mental illnesses. Ahhh the future is awesome"] SR: So the first thing that you'll notice is that people have really strong opinions about this kind of work.

Now I happen to completely agree with the optimism of this first quote, because on a scale of zero to Morgan Freeman's voice, it happens to be one of the most evocative accolades that I've heard come our way.
Rather than finding a fear memory in the brain, we can start by taking our animals, and let's say we put them in a blue box like this blue box here and we find the brain cells that represent that blue box and we trick them to respond to pulses of light exactly like we had said before.
Now the next day, we can take our animals and place them in a red box that they've never experienced before.
We can shoot light into the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box.

You might be wondering how I came up with this idea of turning people into paintings.
But originally, this had nothing to do with either people or paint.
It was about shadows.

I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at.
And then when I took that moment to take a step back, magic.
I had turned my friend into a painting.
I made the tough decision of going home after graduation and not going up to Capitol Hill, but going down to my parents' basement and making it my job to learn how to paint.
I had no idea where to begin.
The last time I'd painted, I was 16 years old at summer camp, and I didn't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and practicing over and over again on that surface, because that's not what this project was about for me.
I was having so much fun with this process.
I was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles, and I wanted to see what else I could do with it.
I came together with a collaborator, Sheila Vand, and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface, and that was milk.

Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin...
to become more compassionate and caring.
But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin.
When life is difficult, your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you.
Okay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier?
Well, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain.

It's a natural anti-inflammatory.
I don't find that a useful or even intelligible concept.
I just wanted a richer and rawer life than I've been able to lead in Britain, or, indeed, that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world.
And it was only when I stumbled across an unfamiliar word that I began to understand what I was looking for.
Why would that possibly have happened?
Well, it now turns out that the whales are crucial to sustaining that entire ecosystem, and one of the reasons for this is that they often feed at depth and then they come up to the surface and produce what biologists politely call large fecal plumes, huge explosions of poop right across the surface waters, up in the photic zone, where there's enough light to allow photosynthesis to take place, and those great plumes of fertilizer
stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain, which stimulate the growth of zooplankton, which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it.
They tell us that when you take away the large animals, you are left with a radically different ecosystem to one which retains its large animals.
And they make, in my view, a powerful case for the reintroduction of missing species.
Rewilding, to me, means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals.
It means taking down the fences, it means blocking the drainage ditches, it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea, but otherwise stepping back.
It has no view as to what a right ecosystem or a right assemblage of species looks like.
It doesn't try to produce a heath or a meadow or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef.
And that motion of building an institution out of a moment of conversation and listening is actually a lot of what my firm, Local Projects, is doing with our engagements in general.
So we're a media design firm, and we're working with a broad array of different institutions building media installations for museums and public spaces.
Our latest engagement is the Cleveland Museum of Art, which we've created an engagement called Gallery One for.
And Gallery One is an interesting project because it started with this massive, $350 million expansion for the Cleveland Museum of Art, and we actually brought in this piece specifically to grow new capacity, new audiences, at the same time that the museum itself is growing.
Glenn Lowry, the head of MoMA, put it best when he said, "We want visitors to actually cease being visitors.
Visitors are transient. We want people who live here, people who have ownership."
Glenn Lowry, the head of MoMA, put it best when he said, "We want visitors to actually cease being visitors.
Visitors are transient. We want people who live here, people who have ownership."
And so what we're doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries, so you can still have a traditional gallery experience, but if you're interested, you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it's from, or manipulate the work itself.
And you can see from these images, the site is so raw and almost archaeological.
And of course the event itself is so recent, somewhere between history and current events, it was a huge challenge to imagine how do you actually live up to a space like this, an event like this, to actually tell that story.
And so what we started with was really a new way of thinking about building an institution, through a project called Make History, which we launched in 2009.
We can't have just a historian or a curator narrating objectively in the third person about an event like that, when you have the witnesses to history who are going to make their way through the actual museum itself.
And so we started imagining the museum, along with the creative team at the museum and the curators, thinking about how the first voice that you would hear inside the museum would actually be of other visitors.
And so we created this idea of an opening gallery called We Remember.
And suddenly the institution, once again, turns into a listening experience.
So I'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices, but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event.
Voice 1: 9/11 was not just a New York experience.
I do. I look for it all the time.
When I was at school, the books were transcribed by transcribers, voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so I'd have volumes to read, and that had been going on, mainly by women, since the late 19th century in this country, but it was the only way I could read.
When I was in high school, I got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder, and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer medium of learning.
But I thank you here, Lois, from this platform.
I saw my first Apple computer in 1984, and I thought to myself, "This thing's got a glass screen, not much use to me."

It's a Keynote Gold 84k, and the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory.

Don't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time.  I think there's more memory in my watch.
It was invented by Russell Smith, a passionate inventor in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people.
Sadly, he died in a light plane crash in 2005, but his memory lives on in my heart.
It meant, for the first time, I could read back what I had typed into it.
But regardless, it's amazing how many products and services are available now to cybercriminals.
For example, this testing platform, which enables the cybercriminals to test the quality of their viruses before they release them on the world.
For a small fee, they can upload it and make sure everything is good.
So isn't it amazing how much control the attackers can get with such a simple operation?

For me, I like to call him Frank.
So Frank is sitting at a desk.
He's got lots of cool information in front of him, high-tech equipment, he's got cameras, he's got a little phone that he can pick up, listen to the ears, all these senses, all these perceptions.
For example, the cocktail effect: You're in a party, having conversations with someone, and yet you can recognize your name without realizing you were listening to that.
Now, for my job, I have to play with techniques to exploit this, to play with your attention as a limited resource.
So if I could control how you spend your attention, if I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction.

It's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?
But it's only a start. Let's try it a little bit differently.
Hold your hands together. Your other hand on top.
If you're watching this little token, this obviously has become a little target, like a red herring.

Attention is a powerful thing.
These people are moving pollen from flower to flower with a paintbrush.
Now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon.
Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand-held vibrator.
Now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon.
Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand-held vibrator.
Now this one's the tomato tickler.  Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the flower, the anther, and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.
It's a natural antibiotic.
It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs within the colony, and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity.
Humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times.
It's aptly named.
It's this big, blood-sucking parasite that compromises the bee's immune system and circulates viruses.
Let me put this all together for you.
SG: So that's exactly right.
We've got ourselves in a world that's massively complex, and we've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it.
And those algorithms, whilst being kind of useful, are also very, very narrow, and we can do better than that, because we can realize that their complexity is not random.
Already in medicine, biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts, like ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone, that have been successfully implanted into patients.
And beyond medicine, biofabrication can be a humane, sustainable and scalable new industry.
And we should begin by reimagining leather.

I emphasize leather because it is so widely used.

It is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history.
Growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat.

Growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat.
It mainly uses one cell type, and it is largely two-dimensional.
This takes millions of cells and expands them into billions.
And we then coax these cells to produce collagen, as they would naturally.
This collagen is the stuff between cells.
And we then coax these cells to produce collagen, as they would naturally.
This collagen is the stuff between cells.
It's natural connective tissue.
This is real, genuine leather, without the animal sacrifice.
It can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells, and better yet, there is no hair to remove, no scars or insect's bites, and no waste.
This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet, a handbag or a car seat.
This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet, a handbag or a car seat.
It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow or an alligator.
And because we make this material, we grow this leather from the ground up, we can control its properties in very interesting ways.
Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year, a year of accusation and trial, but over.
It didn't end that way.
Titus was so bitter.
In one study, we showed people a simulated accident and we asked people, how fast were the cars going when they hit each other?
And we asked other people, how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?
And if we asked the leading "smashed" question, the witnesses told us the cars were going faster, and moreover, that leading "smashed" question caused people to be more likely to tell us that they saw broken glass in the accident scene when there wasn't any broken glass at all.
I was suspicious of this story, and so I started to investigate, and eventually found information that convinced me that this mother was innocent.
I published an exposé on the case, and a little while later, the accusing daughter filed a lawsuit.
Even though I'd never mentioned her name, she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.
And I went through nearly five years of dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation, but finally, finally, it was over and I could really get back to my work.
In the process, however, I became part of a disturbing trend in America where scientists are being sued for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy.
When I got back to my work, I asked this question: if I plant a false memory in your mind, does it have repercussions?
There is an ancient proverb that says it's very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room, especially when there is no cat.
I find this a particularly apt description of science and how science works -- bumbling around in a dark room, bumping into things, trying to figure out what shape this might be, there are reports of a cat somewhere around, they may not be reliable, they may be, and so forth and so on.
Now I know this is different than the way most people think about science.
That's what was missing.
So I thought, well, maybe I should teach a course on ignorance, something I can finally excel at, perhaps, for example.
So I did start teaching this course on ignorance, and it's been quite interesting and I'd like to tell you to go to the website.
So that maybe is not that interesting.
So instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at.
How about the visual system?
We are going to take a quick voyage over the cognitive history of the 20th century, because during that century, our minds have altered dramatically.
As you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900 have altered because the roads are better and because of technology.
And our minds have altered, too.
And, in other words, it was the equipment that was in the hands of the average soldier that was responsible, not greater keenness of eye or steadiness of hand.
Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery that we have picked up over those hundred years, and I think again that another thinker will help us here, and that's Luria.
Luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age, and he found that these people were resistant to classifying the concrete world.
What color are the bears at the North Pole?"
And the response was, "Such a thing is to be settled by testimony.
If a wise person came from the North Pole and told me the bears were white, I might believe him, but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear."
They were things like, what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states that existed at that time?
When they looked at the exams that the state of Ohio gave in 1990, they were all about abstractions.
They were things like, why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital?
It's the stigma inside of others, it's the shame, it's the embarrassment, it's the disapproving look on a friend's face, it's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak, it's the comments that you're crazy.
That's what keeps you from getting help.
That's what makes you hold it in and hide it.
The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one.
Well, we haven't done that, so we can't really expect to find an answer when we're still afraid of the question.
And I don't know what the solution is.
Well, we haven't done that, so we can't really expect to find an answer when we're still afraid of the question.
And I don't know what the solution is.
I wish I did, but I don't -- but I think, I think it has to start here.
But right now, depression is society's deep cut that we're content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it's not there.
Well, it is there. It is there, and you know what? It's okay.
Depression is okay. If you're going through it, know that you're okay.

So I wanted to tell a story that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book, and it's a story of something that happened 3,000 years ago, when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.
And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah in what is now Israel.
There's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.
There's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers, armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor.
And there's artillery, and artillery are archers, but, more importantly, slingers.
That's what David has, and it's important to understand that that sling is not a slingshot.
It's not this, right? It's not a child's toy.
It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.
There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.
Anyone who's unusually tall, that's the first explanation we come up with.
And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it, principally having to do with vision.
Lasting anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, funeral ceremonies are a raucous affair, where commemorating someone who's died is not so much a private sadness but more of a publicly shared transition.
And it's a transition that's just as much about the identity of the living as it is about remembrance of the dead.
So every year, thousands of visitors come to Tana Toraja to see, as it were, this culture of death, and for many people these grandiose ceremonies and the length of the ceremonies are somehow incommensurable with the way that we face our own mortality in the West.
And here you can see these wooden effigies of the ancestors, so these are people who have already been buried, already had a funeral ceremony.
These are called tau tau.
So the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational perspective on death.
So the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational perspective on death.
It ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities.
And it's also a moment of self-awareness.
So I'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience should run out and adopt the traditions of the Torajans.
It might be a little bit difficult to put into play in the United States.
But I want to ask what we can gain from seeing physical death not only as a biological process but as part of the greater human story.
So I asked everybody in my life what they thought.
I turned to my grandmother, who always had plenty of advice, and she said, "Stop being so picky.
You've got to date around.
And they say to me, "Stop complaining."
"You're just being too picky."
So I said, fine, from here on out I'm only going on dates where I know there's Wi-Fi, and I'm bringing my laptop.
What I am trying to do is I'm trying to bring those two views into one so that my images both speak to the viewer's heart but also to the viewer's brain.
Let me demonstrate this based on three projects.
The first one has to do with making sound visible.
But I have to tell you a funny story.
I got an indoor sunburn doing this while shooting in Los Angeles.
Now in Los Angeles, you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches, but I got mine indoors, and what happened is that, if you're shooting at 3,000 frames per second, you need to have a silly amount of light, lots of lights.
It's a liquid that is completely black.
It's got an oily consistency.
And it's got tiny little particles of metal in it, which makes it magnetic.
And it was with those two properties that I was able to create the images that you're seeing right now.
Let me demonstrate this over here.
And what I have here is an empty glass vessel.
Let me demonstrate this over here.
And what I have here is an empty glass vessel.
It's got nothing in it.
I could do it again to show it one more time, but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the whiskey, and that I should rather drink it.
But let me show you a slow motion in a completely darkened room of what I just showed you in this live demonstration.
So what happened is that the flame traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom, burning the mix of the air molecules and the alcohol.
The two dollars for each book did lead those kids to read more books.
It also led them to read shorter books.
But the real question is, what will become of these kids later?
Our children go to different schools.
This isn't good for democracy, nor is it a satisfying way to live, even for those of us who can afford to buy our way to the head of the line.
Here's why.
The conventional wisdom in economics and the view in business has historically been that actually, there's a tradeoff between social performance and economic performance.
The conventional wisdom has been that business actually makes a profit by causing a social problem.
The classic example is pollution.


The work of a transportation commissioner isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals.
And the temporary materials are an important part of the program, because we were able to show how it worked.
And I work for a data-driven mayor, as you probably know.
So it was all about the data.
I think it's fair to say --  -- it used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike, and now New York has become one of the cycling capitals in the United States.
And we moved quickly to create an interconnected network of lanes.
You can see the map in 2007.
And I think you also see it in the kinds of riders that are on the streets.
In the past, it looked like the guy on the left, ninja-clad bike messenger.
And today, cyclists look like New York City looks.
But rather than making war inevitable by viewing this as ideological, we would be wise to seek ways to make peace possible.
Iran and Israel's conflict is a new phenomenon, only a few decades old in a history of 2,500 years, and precisely because its roots are geopolitical, it means that solutions can be found, compromises can be struck, however difficult it yet may be.
After all, it was Yitzhak Rabin himself who said, "You don't make peace with your friends.
And there were two essential explanations or ideas that were prevalent.
And one was punishment.
And this I had heard about before.
And rather than have private capitalism, they have state capitalism.
Instead of liberal democracy, they have de-prioritized the democratic system.
And they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights.
Some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights.
In fact, there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law.
At its very best, the Western model speaks for itself.
In fact, there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law.
At its very best, the Western model speaks for itself.
It's the model that put food on the table.
At its very best, the Western model speaks for itself.
It's the model that put food on the table.
It's the refrigerators.
We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty.
But also, it's going to require that we look at our assumptions, assumptions and strictures that we've grown up with around democracy, around private capitalism, around what creates economic growth and reduces poverty and creates freedoms.
We might have to tear those books up and start to look at other options and be open-minded to seek the truth.
And in fact, these are many of the half-vacant communities that you see today.
Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage, it goes underwater, and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you're doing.
So we know what it's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars.
These changes and others like them changed the way that Portlanders live, and their vehicle-miles traveled per day, the amount that each person drives, actually peaked in 1996, has been dropping ever since, and they now drive 20 percent less than the rest of the country.
The typical Portland citizen drives four miles less, and 11 minutes less per day than they did before.
The economist Joe Cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those 11 minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all income earned in the region.
Orlando: 20 per 100,000.
It's not whether you're in the city or not, it's how is your city designed?
Was it designed around cars or around people?
There are only so many people in this country at any given time, and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact.
And they said, let's measure CO2 per household, and when they did that, the maps just flipped, coolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs, and red hot in these exurban "drive till you qualify" neighborhoods.
So a fundamental shift, and now you have environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser saying we are a destructive species.
He built a playhouse for our daughter.
And meanwhile, I'm burying myself in the Internet looking for specialists.
I'm looking for a cure.
It's not a bug.
It's a feature.
So we need to think more constructively about this very common, very profound and very powerful human emotion.
And isn't that what we're missing?
How can we learn that people's decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly, powerfully, many times irrationally, on the slimmest of hopes?
The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial.
Of course, the accuracy keeps getting worse.
[27% of subjects' first 5 SSN digits identified ] But in fact, we even decided to develop an iPhone app which uses the phone's internal camera to take a shot of a subject and then upload it to a cloud and then do what I just described to you in real time: looking for a match, finding public information, trying to infer sensitive information, and then sending back to the phone
so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject, an example of augmented reality, probably a creepy example of augmented reality.
Now marketers like us to believe that all information about us will always be used in a manner which is in our favor.
But think again. Why should that be always the case?
In a movie which came out a few years ago, "Minority Report," a famous scene had Tom Cruise walk in a mall and holographic personalized advertising would appear around him.
However, in the book, he also offers us a way out of that society, similar to the path that Adam and Eve had to follow to leave the garden.
In the words of the Savage, regaining autonomy and freedom is possible, although the price to pay is steep.
So I do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information, the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom, rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us.
HP:  YR: I was born and raised near Manchester, in England, but I'm not going to say it in English to you, because I'm trying to avoid any assumptions that might be made from my northern accent.
HP:  YR: The only problem with masking it with Chinese Mandarin is I can only speak this paragraph, which I have learned by heart when I was visiting in China.  So all I can do is keep repeating it in different tones and hope you won't notice.
HP:   YR: Needless to say, I would like to apologize to any Mandarin speakers in the audience.

I said, "Yes. So?"
He then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct, and that I had learned it very well, but in a woman's voice.
HP: Okay. So this imitation business does come with risk.
Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people are wearing cotton right now.
It's a brilliant textile in use.
It's really dirty in production.
And we do not want to wait another hundred years.
So we've launched a women's open network this week in IKEA, and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.
So the message here is, measure what you care about and lead the change, and don't wait a hundred years.
And malaria nets actually are playing a role in that.
This shouldn't surprise us, because actually, everybody grows.
If you go back to Imperial Rome in the Year 1 A.D., there was admittedly about 1,800 years where there wasn't an awful lot of growth.
And then something happened in 1980.
Boom! India began to explode.
It wasn't a "Hindu rate of growth," "democracies can't grow." Actually India could.
We will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe, and to explain my point, let me first tell you what the Higgs is about, and to do so, we have to go back to one tenth of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang.
And according to the Higgs theory, at that instant, a dramatic event took place in the universe.
Space-time underwent a phase transition.
It was something very similar to the phase transition that occurs when water turns into ice below zero degrees.
But in our case, the phase transition is not a change in the way the molecules are arranged inside the material, but is about a change of the very fabric of space-time.
During this phase transition, empty space became filled with a substance that we now call Higgs field.
But in our case, the phase transition is not a change in the way the molecules are arranged inside the material, but is about a change of the very fabric of space-time.
During this phase transition, empty space became filled with a substance that we now call Higgs field.
And this substance may seem invisible to us, but it has a physical reality.
And this substance may seem invisible to us, but it has a physical reality.
It surrounds us all the time, just like the air we breathe in this room.
And some elementary particles interact with this substance, gaining energy in the process.
This is tiny when expressed in familiar units, because it's equal to something like 10 to the minus 22 grams, but it is large in particle physics units, because it is equal to the weight of an entire molecule of a DNA constituent.
So armed with this information from the LHC, together with some colleagues here at CERN, we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into the ultra-dense Higgs state, and we found a very intriguing result.
Our calculations showed that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass is very special.
It has been speculated that our universe is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse made out of a multitude of bubbles, and each bubble is a different universe with different fundamental constants and different physical laws.
And in this context, you can only talk about the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass.
Then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse.
Then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse.
It would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach.
In principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach, and yet, the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around 30, 35 degrees.
Discrete moments from our lives are its chapters.
But the story is not about these chapters.
It's the whole book.
Our story, therefore, needs two dimensions of time: a long arc of time that is our lifespan, and the timeframe of direct experience that is the moment.
Now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment, but the one that narrates needs several moments, a whole sequence of them, and that's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time.
Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything, in the erosion of a grain of sand, in the budding of a little bud into a rose.
Its focus, instead, is to distract us at every turn on the road.
Every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else.
Are you reading an interview by an author?
Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it.
Like it. Find other books exactly like his.
Find other people reading those books.
Sandy was a reminder of how such an illusion can shatter.
There were those with power and water, and those without.
There are those who went back to their lives, and those who are still displaced after so many months.
Night after night, he took me up on the terrace, on his shoulders, and pointed out Jupiter and Saturn and the Great Bear to me.
And even here, when I look at the Great Bear, I get back that feeling of being a child, hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder, and I can get back that feeling of being a child again.
What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact, but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact.
My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take, that time can't be fought, and because it will pass and it will move, we owe the present moment our full attention.
Attention is time.
One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention, and definitely from my grandmother, love and attention were one and the same thing.
Attention is time.
One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention, and definitely from my grandmother, love and attention were one and the same thing.
The digital world cannibalizes time, and in doing so, I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves.
Wild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned to the region in force, the very real, very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans.
The dead zone, it turns out, is full of life.
And there is a kind of heroic resilience, a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at 5 a.m.
The power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative.
Home and community are forces that rival even radiation.
Now radiation or not, these women are at the end of their lives.
Using very, very conservative assumptions, this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.
If we assume that the narcos only have access to the wholesale part, which we know is false, that still leaves you with yearly revenues of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.
To put these numbers in perspective, Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.
And here, you can see one such example, where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red.
This blue neuron is connected with the locomotor center, and what this constellation of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with the locomotor center with only one relay neuron.
But the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area.
And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah.
Due to be opened very soon, it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center.
You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting.
You think about the largest IKEA store you've ever been in.
This is five times larger.
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store?
That might sound outlandish, but we already have cases where this has happened, for example, the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government, and which, to spread, subverted the security of the Windows Update network, meaning here, the company was hacked by their own government.
And there's more evidence supporting this theory as well.
Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies.

So why do we learn mathematics?
Essentially, for three reasons: calculation, application, and last, and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it, inspiration.
Together, they form a one-by-two rectangle.
Beneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square, and next to that, a three-by-three square, beneath that, a five-by-five square, and then an eight-by-eight square, creating one giant rectangle, right?
Now let me ask you a simple question: what is the area of the rectangle?
Just as we created it.
It's one squared plus one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared. Right?
That's the area.
On St. Patrick's Day of 2008, I reported to the hospital for surgery to remove a brain tumor.
The surgery was successful.
Two days later, my sight started to fail.
Some of it's kind of wrong and not helpful.
But it's all good in the grand scheme of things.
But one time I was in Oakland walking along Broadway, and came to a corner.
The parking meter, invented in Oklahoma City.
You're welcome.
Having an economy, though, that relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs, and that was certainly the case in Oklahoma City's history.
And so they started helping us drive traffic to the website.
Now, the web address was And I appeared on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" one weekday morning to talk about the initiative, and on that day, 150,000 visits were placed to our website.
People were signing up, and so the pounds started to add up, and the conversation that I thought was so important to have was starting to take place.

It was taking place inside the homes, mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids.
Highly educated twentysomethings are moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region and, indeed, even from further away, in California.
When we reached a million pounds, in January of 2012, I flew to New York with some our participants who had lost over 100 pounds, whose lives had been changed, and we appeared on the Rachael Ray show, and then that afternoon, I did a round of media in New York pushing the same messages that you're accustomed to hearing about obesity and the dangers of it.
And I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine, the same magazine that had put us on that list five years before.


Today I am going to teach you how to play my favorite game: massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.
Stand up, my friends.
All right.
Don't start wrestling yet.
Stand up, my friends.
All right.
Don't start wrestling yet.
Don't start wrestling yet.
If you have a free thumb, wave it around, make sure it gets connected.
Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check.
It just didn't work out for you.
That's okay, because you learned a new skill today.
You learned, from scratch, a game you never knew before.
Those missions could be as simple as just a few way points, or they could be slightly longer and more complicated, to fly along a river system.
Sometimes, we fly the drone in a lawnmower-type pattern and take pictures of that area, and those pictures can be processed to produce a map of that forest.
Other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally.
Other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally.
Now whatever your mission is, once you've programmed it, you simply upload it to the autopilot system, bring your drone to the field, and launch it simply by tossing it in the air.
And often we'll go about this mission taking pictures or videos along the way, and usually at that point, we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee, sit back, and relax for the next few minutes, although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes worrying that the drone will not return.
It weighs only about two kilograms, but it can carry half its weight.
It is a fully autonomous system.
During its mission, it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop, which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time.
Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation, and the white are wide open spaces.
And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level of hunting male and female lions.
All of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which male lions do their hunting.
And in this case, we found gold mining activity, all of it illegal, set back away from the river's edge, as you'll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right.
Don't worry, we're working with the authorities to deal with this and many, many other problems in the region.
So in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique, important corridors like the western Amazon and the Andes Amazon corridor, we have to start making geographically explicit plans now.
Together, we raised four wonderful children.
I worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder, eventually becoming a chief financial officer in Silicon Valley, a job I really enjoyed.
My family and I bought our first and only home on December 13, 2001, a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot of Los Altos Hills, California, from where I am speaking to you now.
That's the part that's broken.
We believe we can deliver it within hours with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this.
This can transport a small payload today, about two kilograms, over a short distance, about 10 kilometers, but it's part of a wider network that may cover the entire country, maybe even the entire continent.

It's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network.

It's a network for a transportation of matter.
We think this can be -- this is the power of a new paradigm.
So here we are: a new idea about a network for transportation that is based on the ideas of the Internet.
It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer, it's bidirectional, highly adaptable, with very low infrastructure investment, very low ecological footprint.

It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer, it's bidirectional, highly adaptable, with very low infrastructure investment, very low ecological footprint.
If it is a new paradigm, though, there must be other uses for it.
Half a billion of us live in megacities.
We are living through an amazing urbanization trend.
China alone is adding a megacity the size of New York City every two years.
We're going to do working memory today.
Now, working memory is that part of our consciousness that we are aware of at any given time of day.
You're going it right now.
Now, working memory is that part of our consciousness that we are aware of at any given time of day.
You're going it right now.
It's not something we can turn off.
If you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay?
So right now, you're doing just fine.
Now working memory has four basic components.
So right now, you're doing just fine.
Now working memory has four basic components.
It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge.
It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge.
It allows us to reach back into our long-term memory and pull some of that in as we need it, mixes it, processes it in light of whatever our current goal is.
Now the current goal isn't something like, I want to be president or the best surfer in the world.
Now the current goal isn't something like, I want to be president or the best surfer in the world.
It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie, or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room.
Now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that, our ability to take what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy our current goal.
Some will be down to two or three.
What we know is this is really important to the way we function, right?
And it's going to be really important here at TED because you're going to be exposed to so many different ideas.
But it does have certain limits.
Now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate.
We can have a conversation, and I can build a narrative around that so I know where we've been and where we're going and how to contribute to this conversation.
Now working memory is great for allowing us to communicate.

It allows us to problem-solve, critical think.
We can be in the middle of a meeting, listen to somebody's presentation, evaluate it, decide whether or not we like it, ask follow-up questions.
All of that occurs within working memory.
It also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese when what we're really looking for is Red Bull and bacon.  Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for.
In between, we want to talk to people about it.
We're going to write it down, and when you get home, pull out those notes and think about them and end up practicing over time.
Practice for some reason became a very negative thing.
We should expect it to change over time. We have to support that.
The support may come in asking people questions, giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images, but we need to support it.
Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this: what we process, we learn.
And here comes the bad news: Our brain, not the largest one around.
It seems quite vexing.
Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos, but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos, and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos, which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive abilities.
It seems quite vexing.
Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos, but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos, and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos, which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive abilities.
It must be really extraordinary, an exception to the rule.
Theirs may be bigger, but ours is better, and it could be better, for example, in that it seems larger than it should be, with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies.
So that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body.
That's because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body.
Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are, so their brains should also be larger than ours, but instead it's the other way around.
Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain.
The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses.
The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses.
Although it weighs only two percent of the body, it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day.
That's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories, just to keep your brain working.
So this to me became the important question to answer: how many neurons does the human brain have, and how does that compare to other animals?
Now, you may have heard or read somewhere that we have 100 billion neurons, so 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from.
But nobody did.
I've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number, and I could never find it.
It seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain, or in any other brain for that matter.
So I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain, and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup.
So I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain, and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup.
It works like this: You take a brain, or parts of that brain, and you dissolve it in detergent, which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact, so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei that looks like this, like a clear soup.
This soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain.
Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup, you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid, so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution, you can count nuclei, and therefore tell how many cells that brain had.
It's simple, it's straightforward, and it's really fast.
So we've used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far, and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way.
Well, what about our brain then?
We found that we have, on average, 86 billion neurons, 16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex, and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like awareness and logical and abstract reasoning, and that 16 billion is the most neurons that any cortex has, I think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities.
But just as important is what the 86 billion neurons mean.
I love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this.
His brain, like ours, was made in the image of other primate brains.
So the human brain may be remarkable, yes, but it is not special in its number of neurons.
Well, other people have figured out how much energy the human brain and that of other species costs, and now that we knew how many neurons each brain was made of, we could do the math.
And it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same, an average of six calories per billion neurons per day.
So the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple, linear function of its number of neurons, and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect.
When we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured, maybe there's a simple reason.
They just can't afford the energy for both a large body and a large number of neurons.
So we did the math.
No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do.
And I think that's how we got to become human.
Studying the human brain changed the way I think about food.
If you think it's happiness that makes you grateful, think again.
It's gratefulness that makes you happy.
Now, we can ask, what do we really mean by gratefulness?
Grateful living, that is the thing.
And how can we live gratefully?
By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment, as we say.
Grateful living, that is the thing.
And how can we live gratefully?
By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment, as we say.
And how can we live gratefully?
By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment, as we say.
It's a gift. You haven't earned it.
If we didn't have this present moment, we wouldn't have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything, and this moment is a gift.
It's a given moment, as we say.
Now, we say the gift within this gift is really the opportunity.
Opportunity is the gift within every gift, and we have this saying, opportunity knocks only once.
Well, think again.
Every moment is a new gift, over and over again, and if you miss the opportunity of this moment, another moment is given to us, and another moment.
But I didn't say we can be grateful for everything.
I said we can be grateful in every given moment for the opportunity, and even when we are confronted with something that is terribly difficult, we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity that is given to us.
It isn't as bad as it might seem.
But whatever it is, if we take this opportunity, we go with it, we are creative, those are the creative people.
And that little stop, look, go, is such a potent seed that it can revolutionize our world.
Because we are at the present moment in the middle of a change of consciousness, and you will be surprised if you -- I am always surprised when I hear how many times this word "gratefulness" and "gratitude" comes up.
Because we are at the present moment in the middle of a change of consciousness, and you will be surprised if you -- I am always surprised when I hear how many times this word "gratefulness" and "gratitude" comes up.
Everywhere you find it, a grateful airline, a restaurant gratefulness, a café gratefulness, a wine that is gratefulness.
Yes, I have even come across a toilet paper whose brand is called "Thank You."  There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware how important this is and how this can change our world.
What we need is a networking of smaller groups, smaller and smaller groups who know one another, who interact with one another, and that is a grateful world.
A grateful world is a world of joyful people.
Grateful people are joyful people, and joyful people -- the more and more joyful people there are, the more and more we'll have a joyful world.
A grateful world is a world of joyful people.
Grateful people are joyful people, and joyful people -- the more and more joyful people there are, the more and more we'll have a joyful world.
We have a network for grateful living, and it has mushroomed.
We couldn't understand why it mushroomed.
We have an opportunity for people to light a candle when they are grateful for something.
And there have been 15 million candles lit in one decade.
So for every billion dollars we spend in R&D, we're getting less drugs approved into the market.
More money, less drugs. Hmm.
So what's going on here?
We've labeled the white blood cells so you can see them flowing through, and when they detect that infection, they begin to stick.
They stick, and then they try to go into the lung side from blood channel.
And you can see here, we can actually visualize a single white blood cell.
In that tiny chip, you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses our body has to an infection.
It's the way we respond to -- an immune response.
It's pretty exciting.
Now we're really getting excited.
We're not going to ever recreate a whole human in these chips, but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality so that we can make better predictions of what's going to happen in humans.
For example, now we can begin to explore what happens when we put a drug like an aerosol drug.

Those of you like me who have asthma, when you take your inhaler, we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs, how it enters the body, how it might affect, say, your heart.

Does it change the beating of your heart?
Does it get cleared by the liver?
And this is key to the potential of that technology.
Now let me show you our instrument.
This is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab, and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we're going to require in order to link 10 or more organ chips together.

It creates an easy user interface.
One, I care that you spell it right.
Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E.
You'd totally be surprised.
Did you find the gold?
Well, we didn't find any gold, but we decided that what we found was much more valuable.
It was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration.
That is not just poetry.
It's a very powerful principle.
For example, if that is true, a bus with 80 passengers has a right to 80 times more road space than a car with one.
That is not just poetry.
It's a very powerful principle.
For example, if that is true, a bus with 80 passengers has a right to 80 times more road space than a car with one.
But what do we do first?
Ninety-nine percent of the people in those neighborhoods don't have cars.
But you see, when a city is only being created, it's very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure.
Would we see 544 Greyhound bus drivers?
It wouldn't happen.
So I started to get intrigued.
Shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been.
Shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade.
Shipping has quadrupled in size since 1970.

Shipping has quadrupled in size since 1970.
We are more dependent on it now than ever.
On the next table was a Chinese guy, and in the crew room, it was entirely Filipinos.
So that was a normal working ship.
Now how is that possible?
Light doesn't penetrate beneath the surface of the water, so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins and even 800 species of fish communicate by sound.
And a North Atlantic right whale can transmit across hundreds of miles.
A humpback can transmit a sound across a whole ocean.
And this is the project today, 12 years old, still in best condition.
And the kids, they love it.
And for me and my community, this project was a huge success.
It is simply how we protect our walls.
The rain in Burkina comes very fast, and after that, you have floods everywhere in the country.
But for us, the rain is good.
But for us, the rain is good.
It brings sand and gravel to the river we need to use to build.
We just wait for the rain to go.
Now these days, with so many people hiking around, it's pretty hard to find a new cave, so you can imagine how excited we were to find three new caves within sight of Oregon's largest city and realize that they had never been explored or mapped before.
It was kind of like being an astronaut, because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone to before.
So what is a glacier?
It was kind of like being an astronaut, because we were getting to see things and go places that no one had ever seen or gone to before.
So what is a glacier?
Well, those of you who have ever seen or touched snow, you know that it's really light, because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together, and it's mostly air.
Now each year, more and more ice stacks up on top of it, and eventually it gets so heavy that it starts to slide down the mountain under its own weight, forming a slow-moving river of ice.
When ice packed like that starts to move, we call it a glacier, and we give it a name.
The name of the glacier these caves are formed in is the Sandy Glacier.
Then you use a compass and an inclinometer to measure the direction the cave is headed and measure the slope of the floor and the ceilings.
Now those of you taking trigonometry, that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there.
In fact, the more I mapped and studied caves, the more useful I found all that math that I originally hated in school to be.

In fact, the more I mapped and studied caves, the more useful I found all that math that I originally hated in school to be.
So when you're done surveying, you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well, and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this, and it'll show you both a bird's-eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage, kind of like an ant farm view.
Another really cool things is that, as seeds and birds land on the surface of the glacier and die, they get buried in the snow and gradually become part of the glacier, sinking deeper and deeper into the ice.
As these caves form and melt their way up into the ice, they make these artifacts rain down from the ceiling and fall onto the cave floor, where we end up finding them.
For example, this is a noble fir seed we found.
Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble.
He turns. He begins to make his way to me.
The croc again continues to shake me.
It goes to bite me a second time.
I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream.
As it bites the second time, I kick.
And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals.
And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving.
And then one day we came across them at this small water hole.
It was like a hole in reality had opened up and swallowed him.
But then the really shocking question occurred to me: If he could die, could it happen to me too?
Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me?
Now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong, ways in which we miscalculate, misjudge, distort reality, or see what we want to see, and the bias I'm talking about works like this: Confront someone with the fact that they are going to die and they will believe just about any story that tells them it isn't true and they can, instead, live forever,
even if it means taking the existential elevator.
Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all.
In other words, I can do what Jesus did.
Jesus died, he was three days in the [tomb], and then he rose up and lived again.
And the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe, not just for Christians but also Jews and Muslims.
But for others, the whole idea of resurrection, of climbing out of the grave, it's just too much like a bad zombie movie.
They find the body too messy, too unreliable to guarantee eternal life, and so they set their hopes on the third, more spiritual immortality story, the idea that we can leave our body behind and live on as a soul.
Now, the majority of people on Earth believe they have a soul, and the idea is central to many religions.
So 2,000 years later, another philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein, put it like this: "Death is not an event in life: We do not live to experience death.
And so," he added, "in this sense, life has no end."
So it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void, but it wasn't rational, because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience.
And so," he added, "in this sense, life has no end."
So it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void, but it wasn't rational, because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience.
Now, overcoming this bias is not easy because the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us, yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational, and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us, then we can at least start to try to minimize the influence it has on our lives.
Imagine the book of your life, its covers, its beginning and end, and your birth and your death.
You can only know the moments in between, the moments that make up your life.
It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers, whether before your birth or after your death.
You can only know the moments in between, the moments that make up your life.
It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers, whether before your birth or after your death.
And you needn't worry how long the book is, or whether it's a comic strip or an epic.
And most of our audience was representative of the 82 percent African-American population in the city at that time.
So obviously, we have a Q&A portion of our program, and people line up to mics to ask questions.
Many of them step very firmly to the mic, put their hands across their chest, and go, "I know you people are trying to move me out of my house, right?"

return to the way that their grandparents had found them.
Now there's been a lot of speculation since 2010 about what to do with the vacant property, and a lot of that speculation has been around community gardening, or what we call urban agriculture.
So many people would say to us, "What if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland?



So we are moving to a world where the machines we work with are not just intelligent; they are brilliant.
They are self-aware, they are predictive, reactive and social.
It's jet engines, locomotives, gas turbines, medical devices, communicating seamlessly with each other and with us.

We've developed a preventive maintenance system which can be installed on any aircraft.
It's self-learning and able to predict issues that a human operator would miss.
The aircraft, while in flight, will communicate with technicians on the ground.
Similar advances are happening in energy, including renewable energy.
Wind farms equipped with new remote monitorings and diagnostics that allow wind turbines to talk to each other and adjust the pitch of their blades in a coordinated way, depending on how the wind is blowing, can now produce electricity at a cost of less than five cents per kilowatt/hour.
Ten years ago, that cost was 30 cents, six times as much.
And innovation is disruptive.
But let me stress two things here.
First, we've already lived through mechanization of agriculture, automation of industry, and employment has gone up, because innovation is fundamentally about growth.
But let me stress two things here.
First, we've already lived through mechanization of agriculture, automation of industry, and employment has gone up, because innovation is fundamentally about growth.
It makes products more affordable.
Let's look at the big picture.
There are people who argue that today's innovation is all about social media and silly games, with nowhere near the transformational power of the Industrial Revolution.
They say that all the growth-enhancing innovations are behind us.
It's not going to be easy, but it is going to be worth it.
The economic challenges facing us are hard, but when I walk the factory floor, and I see how humans and brilliant machines are becoming interconnected, and I see the difference this makes in a hospital, in an airport, in a power generation plant, I'm not just optimistic, I'm enthusiastic.
This new technological revolution is upon us.
One afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper at the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad, and he said to me, "You Americans, you can put a man on the moon, but when I get home tonight, I won't be able to turn on my lights."
At the time, the U.S. government had spent more than two billion dollars on electricity reconstruction.
How do you ensure technology reaches users?

How do you ensure technology reaches users?
And D-Rev is short for Design Revolution.
And I took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users, and not just any users, but customers who live on less than four dollars a day.
One of the key areas we've been working on recently is medical devices, and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with Iraq's electricity grid then, there are some commonalities.
And we've been able to develop a knee, a polycentric knee, so that type of knee that acts like a human knee, mimics human gait, for 80 dollars retail.
But the key is, you can have this great invention, you can have this great design, but how do you get it to the people who most need it?
How do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives?
How do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives?
So at D-Rev, we've done some other projects, and we looked at three things that we really believe gets technologies to customers, to users, to people who need it.
And the first thing is that the product needs to be world class.
What is the local market like?
How do all these components get to the clinic?
Do they all get there on time? The supply chain.
We did a lot of iterations, not just around this, but some other things.
But here we have the version three, the ReMotion Knee, but if you look in here, you can see the noise dampener. It's quieter.
The other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile.
We made it thinner.
And something that's not obvious is that we designed it for mass production.
And this goes into my last point.
We really, truly believe that if a product is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed, it needs to be market-driven, and market-driven means that products are sold.
They're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized.
Our product needs to be designed to offer value to the end user.
Ours is 79 percent, and we're hoping to get that higher.
Right now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.
in the next three years.
And we've been on a journey.
And the debate has raged, hasn't it, since the Greeks, of isn't it what it's all about?
Isn't life about the journey, not really the destination?
We haven't reached that other shore, and still our sense of pride and commitment, unwavering commitment.
When I turned 60, the dream was still alive from having tried this in my 20s, and dreamed it and imagined it.
The most famous body of water on the Earth today, I imagine, Cuba to Florida.
It's difficult to swim in.
It's causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth, but the tentacles can't get you.
And the hypothermia sets in.
Now I eat whenever I'm hungry, and I've lost 10 pounds.
This was me at age 13, when I started my first diet.
I look at that picture now, and I think, you did not need a diet, you needed a fashion consult.
You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and down within that range, but it's much, much harder to stay outside of it.
The hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates body weight, there are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight, more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it, and the system works like a thermostat, responding to signals from the body by adjusting hunger, activity and metabolism, to keep your weight stable as conditions change.
That's what a thermostat does, right?
That's what a thermostat does, right?
It keeps the temperature in your house the same as the weather changes outside.
Now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter, but that's not going to change the setting on the thermostat, which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up.
Now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter, but that's not going to change the setting on the thermostat, which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up.
Your brain works exactly the same way, responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal.
If you lose a lot of weight, your brain reacts as if you were starving, and whether you started out fat or thin, your brain's response is exactly the same.
For obese people with no healthy habits, the risk is very high, seven times higher than the healthiest groups in the study.
But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too.
In fact, if you look only at the group with all four healthy habits, you can see that weight makes very little difference.
It takes willpower which you could be using to help your kids with their homework or to finish that important work project, and because willpower is limited, any strategy that relies on its consistent application is pretty much guaranteed to eventually fail you when your attention moves on to something else.
Let me leave you with one last thought.
What if we told all those dieting girls that it's okay to eat when they're hungry?
This is pretty amazing.
But there's something missing in this wonderful tour: It's time.
i'm not really sure when this picture was taken.
I'm not even sure it was taken at the same moment as the bird's-eye view.
In my lab, we develop tools to travel not only in space but also through time.
The kind of question we're asking is Is it possible to build something like Google Maps of the past?
So, I can do what historians do.
I can extrapolate.
This is what we call, in computer science, simulation.
If I take a log book, I can consider, it's not just a log book of a Venetian captain going to a particular journey.
I can consider it is actually a log book which is representative of many journeys of that period.
I'm extrapolating.

The entire model of capitalism and the economic model that you and I did business in, and, in fact, continue to do business in, was built around what probably Milton Friedman put more succinctly.
And Adam Smith, of course, the father of modern economics actually said many, many years ago, the invisible hand, which is, "If you continue to operate in your own self-interest you will do the best good for society."
But the question is easier said than done.
But how do we actually get that done?
And I do believe that the answer to that is going to be leadership.
I'm going to get on a stage and admit my daughter was clinging to my leg?
And you said yes, because if you want to talk about getting more women into leadership roles, you have to be honest about how hard it is.
And I did. And I think that's a really important part of the journey.

And you said yes, because if you want to talk about getting more women into leadership roles, you have to be honest about how hard it is.
And I did. And I think that's a really important part of the journey.
That's the kind of change we have to hope for.
PM: Have you been surprised by the global nature of the message?
Because I think when the book first came out, many people thought, well, this is a really important handbook for young women on their way up.
We are stagnating, we are stagnating in so many ways.
And I think we are not really being honest about that, for so many reasons. It's so hard to talk about gender.
We shy away from the word "feminist," a word I really think we need to embrace.
What was the anatomy of my distaste?
Well, so much gold, so vulgar.
You know, so nouveau riche, frankly.
You know, so nouveau riche, frankly.
Leonardo himself had preached against the use of gold, so it was absolutely anathema at that moment.
And then there's little pretty sprigs of flowers everywhere.  And finally, that pink. That damned pink.
It's such an extraordinarily artificial color.
I mean, it's a color that I can't think of anything that you actually see in nature, that looks that shade.
The object even has its own tutu.  This little flouncy, spangly, bottomy bit that sits at the bottom of the vase.
And he now adorns my office.
He's a Staffordshire figure made in the middle of the 19th century.
He represents the actor, Edmund Kean, playing Shakespeare's Richard III.
And the second was something one of our teachers told us.
He actually did the weasel in "Ice Age."
And he said, "As an animator, you're not a director -- you're an actor."
He actually did the weasel in "Ice Age."
And he said, "As an animator, you're not a director -- you're an actor."
So, if you want to find the right motion for a character, don't think about it -- go use your body to find it.
Instead, they were all -- how should I put it -- they were all kind of robotic.
And I thought, what if I took whatever I learned in animation school, and used that to design my robotic desk lamp.
So I went and designed frame by frame to try to make this robot as graceful and engaging as possible.
And I thought, what if I took whatever I learned in animation school, and used that to design my robotic desk lamp.
So I went and designed frame by frame to try to make this robot as graceful and engaging as possible.
And here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop -- and I'm actually redesigning the robot, so, unbeknownst to itself, it's kind of digging its own grave by helping me.
It sometimes makes mistakes and corrects them.
And I had them do this very tedious task that took almost 20 minutes, and they had to work together, somehow simulating, like, a factory job of repetitively doing the same thing.
What I found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot.
So, this is what musicians called a call-and-response interaction, and it also fits very well robots and artificial intelligence.
But I thought, if I use the same ideas I used in the theater play and in the teamwork studies, maybe I can make the robots jam together like a band.
Everybody's riffing off each other, nobody is stopping for a moment.
And then, look how the human musician also responds to what the robot is doing and picking up from its behavior, and at some point can even be surprised by what the robot came up with.
Being a musician is not just about making notes, otherwise nobody would ever go see a live show.
Musicians also communicate with their bodies, with other band members, with the audience, they use their bodies to express the music.
Musicians also communicate with their bodies, with other band members, with the audience, they use their bodies to express the music.
And I thought, we already have a robot musician on stage, why not make it be a full-fledged musician?
And I started designing a socially expressive head for the robot.
I think.  And I went back to my animation tools and tried to figure out not just what a robotic musician would look like, but especially what a robotic musician would move like, to sort of show that it doesn't like what the other person is playing -- and maybe show whatever beat it's feeling at the moment.
So we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot, which was nice.
I'm going to show you now the same kind of performance, this time with a socially expressive head.
So we ended up actually getting the money to build this robot, which was nice.
I'm going to show you now the same kind of performance, this time with a socially expressive head.
And notice one thing -- how the robot is really showing us the beat it's picking up from the human, while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it's doing.

And notice one thing -- how the robot is really showing us the beat it's picking up from the human, while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it's doing.
And also how it changes the way it moves as soon as it starts its own solo.
And the reason is that we can't ignore physical things moving in our environment.
We are wired for that.
So if you have a problem -- maybe your partner is looking at their iPhone or smartphone too much -- you might want to have a robot there to get their attention.
Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society, because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage: in politics and economics, in religion and tradition, in gender and generations.
As I found, if you really want to know a people, you start by looking inside their bedrooms.
Now to be sure, the Arab world is vast and varied.
Today's sexual landscape looks a lot like Europe and America on the brink of the sexual revolution.
But while the West has opened on sex, what we found is that Arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction.
In Egypt and many of its neighbors, this closing down is part of a wider closing in political, social and cultural thought.
The way we organize is based on two pillars.
The hard -- structure, processes, systems.
The soft -- feelings, sentiments, interpersonal relationships, traits, personality.
and between the middle and the front.
Plus I have to pay for the middle office.
The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation.
Next your non-essential systems start to shut down, like digestion.  So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routed away from your extremities, so your fingers don't work anymore.
Your pupils dilate, your muscles contract, your Spidey sense tingles, basically your whole body is trigger-happy.  That condition is not conducive to performing folk music.
I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.
And something good did happen -- I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for.
And I wanted more. But I knew I had to get past this nervousness.
That night I promised myself: I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore.

I'd like to reimagine education.
The last year has seen the invention of a new four-letter word.
We are taking what we develop and learn in the large and applying it in the small to the classroom, to create a blended model of learning.
But before I go into that, let me tell you a story.
When my daughter turned 13, became a teenager, she stopped speaking English, and she began speaking this new language.
When my daughter turned 13, became a teenager, she stopped speaking English, and she began speaking this new language.
I call it teen-lish.
It's a digital language.
had popped in with a different answer.
And then I sat back, fascinated.
Boom, boom, boom, boom, the students were discussing and interacting with each other, and by 4 a.m. that night, I'm totally fascinated, having this epiphany, and by 4 a.m. in the morning, they had discovered the right answer.
This is happening today.
So we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and high schools around the world, from Tsinghua in China to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia to Berkeley in California -- all over the world.
And these kinds of technologies really help, the blended model can really help revolutionize education.
Girls cooked; boys didn't, or so was the message that Hasbro was sending.
And this got me thinking, God, I wish there was a way that I could change this, that could I have my voice heard by Hasbro so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it.
And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org.
At eight years old, I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya's Ideas, and my nonprofit, Maya's Ideas for the Planet.
And I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories.
I'm 13 now, and although I started my business in 2008, my artistic journey started way before then.
My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment.
I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet, so I started doing my own research, and I discovered that even after dyeing has being completed, there is a waste issue that gives a negative impact on the environment.
For example, the grinding of materials, or the dumping of dried powder materials.
We were making what was invisible visible.
I've been doing this for 30 years.
I've been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children.
I was probably 30 and naive.
But I heard about a congressman who had a very, very different point of view.
Do you know what he called this important piece of legislation?
And I have to tell you, I'm passionate about data.
In fact, I am a data nerd.
I'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here.
I'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here.
I am a data nerd, and the reason for that is I want to make sure that if we spend a dollar, that the program works, and if it doesn't work, we should change the plan.
And I also want to say one other thing: We are not going to solve this problem by building more jails or by even building more shelters.
Instead of taking a single, high quality image, we could take a videostream of individually noisier frames, but then we could recombine all of those frames together into very high-quality images using sophisticated pixel processing techniques here on the ground, at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system.
And we applied this technique to many of the other systems on the satellite as well, and day by day, our design evolved from CAD to prototypes to production units.
A few short weeks ago, we packed up SkySat 1, put our signatures on it, and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth.
The urban explosion of the last years of economic boom also produced dramatic marginalization, resulting in the explosion of slums in many parts of the world.
This polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth surrounded by sectors of poverty and the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered is really at the center of today's urban crisis.
But I want to begin tonight by suggesting that this urban crisis is not only economic or environmental.
And they began to realize the necessity to organize themselves even deeper and began to fundraise, to organize budgets, to really be aware of all the knowledge embedded in the urban code in San Diego so that they could begin to redefine the very meaning of public space in the city, expanding it to other categories.
At the end, the teenagers won the case with that evidence, and they were able to construct their skateboard park under that freeway.
Now for many of you, this story might seem trivial or naive.
And you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view.
So we've just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel.
So here's a video.
That sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them.
The next work is Decoy.
This is a cardboard model, so the object is about as tall as I am.
The next work is Decoy.
This is a cardboard model, so the object is about as tall as I am.
It has a rounded body, two arms, and a very tall, head-like antenna, and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself.
So when a viewer passes by, it sort of tilts from side to side, and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer.
So here is the first test scenario.
You see the two movements integrated, and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation.
So this is the final fabricated body of the Decoy.
It appears to be mass-manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines.
Because we are always working from a very personal space, we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance, at least.
Oh yeah, oh yeah. Oh yeah.   I mean, I love all kinds of rhythm.
I like to play jazz, a little funk, and hip hop, a little pop, a little R&B, a little Latin, African.
And this groove right here, comes from the Crescent City, the old second line.
It is rather what is swallowed up and sacrificed in the name of the god of love, or rather in the name of seduction capital.
In light of this observation on contemporary love, how can we think of love in the years to come?
We can envision two hypotheses: The first one consists of betting that this process of narcissistic capitalization will intensify.
Which one do you choose if you want to do the right thing by the environment?
Most people do pick the paper.
Okay, let's think of why.
Most people do pick the paper.
Okay, let's think of why.
It's brown to start with.

It's brown to start with.
Therefore, it must be good for the environment.
It's brown to start with.
Therefore, it must be good for the environment.
It's biodegradable. It's reusable.
It's either the little voice at the back of your head, or it's that gut feeling you get when you've done the right thing, so when you've picked the paper bag or when you've bought a fuel-efficient car.
And environmental folklore is a really important thing because we're trying to do the right thing.
But how do we know if we're actually reducing the net environmental impacts that our actions as individuals and as professionals and as a society are actually having on the natural environment?
And environmental folklore is a really important thing because we're trying to do the right thing.
But how do we know if we're actually reducing the net environmental impacts that our actions as individuals and as professionals and as a society are actually having on the natural environment?
So the thing about environmental folklore is it tends to be based on our experiences, the things we've heard from other people.
And we've busted a bunch of myths.
So to start with, there's a word that's used a lot.
It's used a lot in marketing, and it's used a lot, I think, in our conversation when we're talking about sustainability, and that's the word biodegradability.
Half of the world's produced food is wasted.
That's the latest U.N. stats. Up to half of the food.
It's insane. It's 1.3 billion tons of food per annum.
the moment that very popular TV shows end.
The minute the ad break comes on, this man has to rush to buy nuclear power from France, because everybody turns their kettles on at the same time.
1.5 million kettles, seriously problematic.
I'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative.
But in the regards to using sustainability as a parameter, as a criteria for fueling systems-based solutions, because as I've just demonstrated with these simple products, they're participating in these major problems.
So we need to look across the entire life of the things that we do.
So breaking things back down and delivering smartly, elegantly, sophisticated solutions that take into consideration the entire system and the entire life of the thing, everything, all the way back to the extraction through to the end of life, we can start to actually find really innovative solutions.
And I'll just leave you with one very quick thing that a designer said to me recently who I work with, a senior designer.
I said, "How come you're not doing sustainability? I know you know this."
And governance relates to the oversight of companies by their boards and investors.
See, I told you this is the really juicy stuff.
But ESG is the measure of sustainability, and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors with financial factors into the investment process.
What if they used that firepower to allocate more of their capital to companies working the hardest at solving these challenges or at least not exacerbating them?
What if we work and save and invest, only to find that the world we retire into is more stressed and less secure than it is now?
What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water?
I'd like to talk today about a powerful and fundamental aspect of who we are: our voice.
Each one of us has a unique voiceprint that reflects our age, our size, even our lifestyle and personality.
In the words of the poet Longfellow, "the human voice is the organ of the soul."
So we decided to do exactly that.
We set out with a little bit of funding from the National Science Foundation, to create custom-crafted voices that captured their unique vocal identities.
We call this project VocaliD, or vocal I.D., for vocal identity.
Now I told you earlier that I'd spent a good part of my career understanding and studying the source characteristics of people with severe speech disorder, and what I've found is that even though their filters were impaired, they were able to modulate their source: the pitch, the loudness, the tempo of their voice.
These are called prosody, and I've been documenting for years that the prosodic abilities of these individuals are preserved.
So when I realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity, I had this idea.
And then how are you distilling this into understanding potential discontinuities, and then making a decision to do something right now so that you're prepared and ready?
There's a leadership team that does a practice where they bring together each member collecting, here are trends that impact me, here are trends that impact another team member, and they share these, and then make decisions, to course-correct a strategy or to anticipate a new move.
Great leaders are not head-down.
We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate -- gorillas, orangutans, what have you.
So we're extremely closely related to them, and as you'll see in terms of our behavior, we've got some relationship as well.
So what I'm asking today, the question I want to explore with you today is, what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality?
The average human has sex about 1,000 times per birth.
If that number seems high for some of you, I assure you it seems low for others in the room.
We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos.
I'm sorry. It's true.
The human, some of you will be happy to hear, has the largest, thickest penis of any primate.
Now, this evidence goes way beyond anatomy.
And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of.
But like most things in technology and the technology world, hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil.
For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity there's one that's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill.

It's about critical thinking.

It's about questioning existing ways of doing things.
Now that's why most of the people that work with children with autism -- speech therapists, educators -- what they do is, they try to help children with autism communicate not with words, but with pictures.
So if a child with autism wanted to say, "I want soup," that child would pick three different pictures, "I," "want," and "soup," and they would put these together, and then the therapist or the parent would understand that this is what the kid wants to say.
And this has been incredibly effective; for the last 30, 40 years people have been doing this.
And this has been incredibly effective; for the last 30, 40 years people have been doing this.
In fact, a few years back, I developed an app for the iPad which does exactly this. It's called Avaz, and the way it works is that kids select different pictures.
These pictures are sequenced together to form sentences, and these sentences are spoken out.
Now, this was very effective.
There are thousands of children using this, you know, all over the world, and I started thinking about what it does and what it doesn't do.
And I realized something interesting: Avaz helps children with autism learn words.
Instead of arranging words in an order, in sequence, as a sentence, you arrange them in this map, where they're all linked together not by placing them one after the other but in questions, in question-answer pairs.
And so if you do this, then what you're conveying is not a sentence in English, but what you're conveying is really a meaning, the meaning of a sentence in English.
Now, meaning is really the underbelly, in some sense, of language.
I told whom? I told the carpenter.
Now we start with a different part of the sentence.
We start with the word "pay," and we add the ability filter to it to make it "can pay."
They were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech which were much more complicated but much more effective than equivalent sentences in English, and I started thinking about why that might be the case.
And I had an idea, and I want to talk to you about this idea next.
In about 1997, about 15 years back, there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language, and they found something very interesting.
There's a song about India, and there's a description of the country as, it says, .
That means "ever-smiling speaker of beautiful languages."
Language is beautiful.
Language is beautiful.
I think it's the most beautiful of human creations.
I think it's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented.
And I think there are four major types, and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big.
So, how big?
Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster.
And I think there are four major types, and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big.
So, how big?
Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster.
This is in false color.
It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing.
And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light?
Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange.
Certainly what I've said so far is crazy.
Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy.
Certainly what I've said so far is crazy.
Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy.
If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up.
If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up.
What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate.
Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding.
They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy.
And, again, we want to learn more about it.
So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales?
Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower.
Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated.
Here is a computer simulation.
If a rating agency rates a country, it basically assesses and evaluates a country's debt and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt.
So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency, the country has to pay more in order to borrow money on the international markets.
So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer, because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow.
If we conduct a sovereign rating, we basically take a look at the economic soil of a country, its macroeconomic fundamentals.
But we also have to ask the question, who is cultivating the economic soil of a country, right?
Well, a country has many gardeners, and one of them is the government, so we have to ask the question, how is a country governed?
And this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward-looking indicators.
These are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country.
I hope you would agree it's important for you to know if your government is willing to invest in renewable energy and education.
So in contrast to the current system, INCRA would be fully transparent.
So in a nutshell, INCRA would offer an alternative to the current system of the big three rating agencies by adding a new, nonprofit player to the mix that would increase the competition, it would increase the transparency of the sector, and it would also increase the quality.
I can tell that sovereign ratings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very complex global financial world, but I tell you it's a very important one, and a very important one to fix, because sovereign ratings affect all of us, and they should be addressed and should be defined as public goods.
Smaller ones don't have the resources or the expertise, and so there's this market of Western companies who are happy to supply them with the tools and techniques for a price.
Gamma is just one of these companies.
I should note also that Gamma never actually sold their software to the Egyptian government.
You can see there's a little sticker that's placed over his camera.
He knows what kind of surveillance is possible, and so clearly he doesn't want it to be used against him.
Muench has said that he intends for his software to be used to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles.
Gamma's software has been located on servers in countries around the world, many with really atrocious track records and human rights violations.
They really are selling their software around the world.
Gamma is not the only company in the business.
As I said, it's a $5 billion industry.
One of the other big guys in the industry is an Italian company called Hacking Team.
Now, Hacking Team has what is probably the slickest presentation.
["Immune to any protection system Hidden collection infrastructure"] Deployed all over your country.
["Up to hundreds of thousands of targets Managed from a single spot"] Exactly what we do.
Christopher Soghoian: So, it would be funny if it wasn't true, but, in fact, Hacking Team's software is being sold to governments around the world.
["Up to hundreds of thousands of targets Managed from a single spot"] Exactly what we do.

Last year we learned, for example, that it's been used to target Moroccan journalists by the Moroccan government.
This is the Art-o-mat, an art vending machine that sells small artistic creations by different artists, usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes, in limited edition.
This is Oliver Medvedik. He's not a vending machine, but he is one of the founders of Genspace, a community biolab in Brooklyn, New York, where anybody can go and take classes and learn how to do things like grow E. coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry DNA.
In fact, I saw Oliver do one of these strawberry DNA extractions about a year ago, and this is what led me onto this bizarre path that I'm going to talk to you right now.
Over the next year, while my family was righting itself, I started to realize that even if I could go back into government, I didn't want to.
I didn't want to miss the last five years that my sons were at home.
I finally allowed myself to accept what was really most important to me, not what I was conditioned to want or maybe what I conditioned myself to want, and that decision led to a reassessment of the feminist narrative that I grew up with and have always championed.
And Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones, because they have a choice about how much they want to work.
Millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn the income they need, and many of those workers are scrambling.
They're patching together care arrangements that are inadequate and often actually unsafe.
Increasingly in developed countries, women are socialized to believe that our place is no longer only in the home, but men are actually still where they always were.
Men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners, that to derive their self-worth from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder.
The feminist revolution still has a long way to go.
You may think that can't happen, but I grew up in a society where my mother put out small vases of cigarettes for dinner parties, where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms, and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual.
Today, not so much.
The revolution for human equality can happen.
Today, not so much.
The revolution for human equality can happen.
It is happening.
Actually, it isn't.
What it is is a map of innovation.
And it's really easy to see where innovation's going on.
Now, the tapir is a mammal from South America.
And the tapir has a prehensile penis.
It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands.
It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands.
And it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus, not to mention it's a pretty good size.
The biggest penis in the animal kingdom, however, is not that of the tapir.
So we've seen very different strategies that males are using when it comes to winning a female partner.
We've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex.
We've also seen a titillation strategy Now unfortunately, in the animal kingdom, it's the coercion strategy that we see time and time again.
Joe's 32 years old and a murderer.
I met Joe 13 years ago on the lifer wing at Wormwood Scrubs high-security prison in London.
I'd like you to imagine this place.
But then, in the 1990s, studies starting showing, following the lead of Elizabeth Gould at Princeton and others, studies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis, in the adult mammalian brain, first in the olfactory bulb, which is responsible for our sense of smell, then in the hippocampus involving short-term memory, and finally in the amygdala itself.
In order to understand how this process works, I left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford specializing in learning and development.
Instead of psychopaths, I studied mice, because the same pattern of brain responses appears across many different species of social animals.
Well, where were these kids before?
They were out there suffering, is where they were.
So we started a program in 2007.
And she was offered contracts as a model, at which point she teased me, when she said, "You know, I might have had a better chance as a model if you'd made me six feet one."
Go figure.
So this picture, I think, says it all.
You show up for that debate and you've already lost it.
SP: But can reason lead us in directions that are good or decent or moral?
After all, you pointed out that reason is just a means to an end, and the end depends on the reasoner's passions.
Empathy emerges early in life, perhaps before the age of one.
Books on empathy have become bestsellers, like "The Empathic Civilization" and "The Age of Empathy."
RNG: I'm all for empathy. I mean, who isn't?

RNG: I'm all for empathy. I mean, who isn't?
But all on its own, it's a feeble instrument for making moral progress.
SP: Or with hideous punishments like breaking on the wheel?
RNG: The prohibition in our constitution of cruel and unusual punishments was a response to a pamphlet circulated in 1764 by the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria.
Cesare Beccaria: As punishments become more cruel, the minds of men, which like fluids always adjust to the level of the objects that surround them, become hardened, and after a hundred years of cruel punishments, breaking on the wheel causes no more fear than imprisonment previously did.
Everything beyond this is superfluous, and therefore tyrannical.
SP: But surely antiwar movements depended on mass demonstrations and catchy tunes by folk singers and wrenching photographs of the human costs of war.
RNG: No doubt, but modern anti-war movements reach back to a long chain of thinkers who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize our emotions against war, such as the father of modernity, Erasmus.
The cause of rejoicings made by one side is to the other a cause of mourning.
Whatever is unfortunate in war, is severely so indeed, and whatever, on the contrary, is called good fortune, is a savage and a cruel good fortune, an ungenerous happiness deriving its existence from another's woe.
SP: But everyone knows that the movement to abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion.
RNG: But the ball got rolling a century before.
John Locke bucked the tide of millennia that had regarded the practice as perfectly natural.
He argued that it was inconsistent with the principles of rational government.
SP: What about religious faith in general?
RNG: Eh, I'm not holding my breath.
SP: Still, I have become convinced that reason is a better angel that deserves the greatest credit for the moral progress our species has enjoyed and that holds out the greatest hope for continuing moral progress in the future.
Or the anonymous company, which bought up Americans' tax debts, piled on the legal fees and then gave homeowners a choice: Pay up or lose your home.
Imagine being threatened with losing your home sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars, and not being able to find out who you were really up against.
Now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too.
It's going to be a springboard for our global campaigning.
And the techies among you, you could really help us create a prototype public registry to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be.
Campaign groups from around the world have come together to work on this issue.
And so you're very conscious in the cockpit; you're thinking about all of the things that you might have to do, all the switches and all the wickets you have to go through.
And as the time gets closer and closer, this excitement is building.
And then about three and a half minutes before launch, the huge nozzles on the back, like the size of big church bells, swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle, like the vehicle is alive underneath you, like an elephant getting up off its knees or something.
I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me, it was just an obvious thing -- I want to somehow turn myself into that.
But the real question is, how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it?
How do you deal with fear versus danger?
You are in a one-person spaceship that is your spacesuit, and you're going through space with the world.
It's an entirely different perspective, you're not looking up at the universe, you and the Earth are going through the universe together.
And you're holding on with one hand, looking at the world turn beside you.
But then you could say, well is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not?
I don't know. Are there brown recluses here?
So if you actually do the research, you find out that in the world there are about 50,000 different types of spiders, and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of 50,000.

So if you actually do the research, you find out that in the world there are about 50,000 different types of spiders, and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of 50,000.
And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters here in B.C., there's about 720, 730 different types of spiders and there's one -- one -- that is venomous, and its venom isn't even fatal, it's just kind of like a nasty sting.

And that spider -- not only that, but that spider has beautiful markings on it, it's like "I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation symbol on my back, it's the black widow."
And that spider -- not only that, but that spider has beautiful markings on it, it's like "I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation symbol on my back, it's the black widow."
So, if you're even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider -- and it lives close the ground, you're walking along, you are never going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you.
Spider webs like this, it doesn't build those, it builds them down in the corners.
The danger is entirely different than the fear.
How do you get around it, though?
How do you change your behavior?
These two parts here actually melt, we jettison them and they burn up in the atmosphere.
The only part that survives is the little bullet that we're riding in, and it falls into the atmosphere, and in essence you are riding a meteorite home, and riding meteorites is scary, and it ought to be.
But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming, like you would if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite back to Earth --  -- instead, 20 years previously we had started studying Russian, and then once you learn Russian, then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian, and then we learned vehicle control theory, and then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again.
So we came back, we came thundering back to Earth and this is what it looked like to land in a Soyuz, in Kazakhstan.
Reporter: And you can see one of those search and recovery helicopters, once again that helicopter part of dozen such Russian Mi-8 helicopters.
Touchdown -- 3:14 and 48 seconds, a.m. Central Time.
And then eventually the Russians reach in, drag you out, plunk you into a chair, and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience.
You have taken the dreams of that nine-year-old boy, which were impossible and dauntingly scary, dauntingly terrifying, and put them into practice, and figured out a way to reprogram yourself, to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise.
Just to finish, they asked me to play that guitar.
CA: So that's a general response saying that because of his revelations, access that you had to certain types of information has been shut down, has been closed down.
But the concern is that the nature of that access was not necessarily legitimate in the first place.
I mean, describe to us this Bullrun program where it's alleged that the NSA specifically weakened security in order to get the type of access that you've spoken of.

RL: So there are, when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before, use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology, and they do, because it's a great system, it's the most complex system ever devised by man, and it is a wonder, and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that, and it's just a wonderful thing.
One is the Signals Intelligence mission that we've unfortunately read so much about in the press.
The other one is the Information Assurance mission, which is to protect the national security systems of the United States, and by that, that's things like the communications that the president uses, the communications that control our nuclear weapons, the communications that our military uses around the world, and the communications that we use with our allies, and that some of our allies themselves use.
And so we make recommendations on standards to use, and we use those same standards, and so we are invested in making sure that those communications are secure for their intended purposes.

CA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that when it comes to the Internet at large, any strategy is fair game if it improves America's safety.
And I think this is partly where there is such a divide of opinion, that there's a lot of people in this room and around the world who think very differently about the Internet.

It's the connector of all.
And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms.
And from that lens, what the NSA has done is equivalent to the authorities back in Germany inserting some device into every printing press that would reveal which books people bought and what they read.
Can you understand that from that viewpoint, it feels outrageous?

RL: I do understand that, and I actually share the view of the utility of the Internet, and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet.
These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm.
A tapeworm is effectively a long, living gut with genitals at one end and a hooked mouth at the other.
As a freelance journalist, I sympathize.

As a freelance journalist, I sympathize.
The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body, but it also does other things.
Why? Because the tapeworm, like many other parasites, has a complicated life cycle involving many different hosts.
The shrimp are just one step on its journey.
Its ultimate destination is this, the greater flamingo.
And here is another example of a parasitic manipulation.
This is a suicidal cricket.
This cricket swallowed the larvae of a Gordian worm, or horsehair worm.

This is a suicidal cricket.
This cricket swallowed the larvae of a Gordian worm, or horsehair worm.
The worm grew to adult size within it, but it needs to get into water in order to mate, and it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket's brain, causing it to behave erratically.
Why, for example, does this caterpillar start violently thrashing about when another insect gets close to it and those white cocoons that it seems to be standing guard over?
Is it maybe protecting its siblings?
No.
The eggs hatched and the young wasps devoured the caterpillar alive before bursting out of its body.
See what I mean?
Now, the caterpillar didn't die.
And remember the Gordian worm that I showed you, the cricket thing?
One Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato found that in one stream, these things drive so many crickets and grasshoppers into the water that the drowned insects make up some 60 percent of the diet of local trout.
Manipulation is not an oddity.
She stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ equipped with small sensory bumps that allow her to feel the distinctive texture of a roach's brain.
So like a person blindly rooting about in a bag, she finds the brain, and she injects it with venom into two very specific clusters of neurons.
Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon.

It doesn't kill the roach, nor does it sedate it.
The wasp basically un-checks the escape-from-danger box in the roach's operating system, allowing her to lead her helpless victim back to her lair by its antennae like a person walking a dog.
And once there, she lays an egg on it, egg hatches, devoured alive, bursts out of body, yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill.
Now I would argue that, once stung, the cockroach isn't a roach anymore.
If there are any —   I've got a red dot on my forehead now, don't I?
If there are any, this is a good candidate for them.
This is Toxoplasma gondii, or Toxo, for short, because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname.
This is Toxoplasma gondii, or Toxo, for short, because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname.
Toxo infects mammals, a wide variety of mammals, but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat.
And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse, it turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile.

Isn't it remarkable that, after thousands of years of people doing mostly representational art, that modern art, comparatively speaking, is about 15 minutes old, yet now pervasive.
As with many other important innovations, those radical ideas required no new technology, just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment, plus resiliency in the face of near-universal criticism and rejection.
In our home, art was everywhere.
We visited the great museums and historic buildings of both Europe and the Middle East, but to encourage my growing interest in science and technology, they would simply drop me off in places like the London Science Museum, where I would wander endlessly for hours by myself studying the history of science and technology.
Then, when I was about nine years old, we went to Rome.
On one particularly hot summer day, we visited a drum-shaped building that from the outside was not particularly interesting.

My dad said it was called the Pantheon, a temple for all of the gods.
My dad said it was called the Pantheon, a temple for all of the gods.
It didn't look all that special from the outside, as I said, but when we walked inside, I was immediately struck by three things: First of all, it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside.
It was very dark, the only source of light being an big open hole in the roof.
But the ceiling was amazing.
It looked like a Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome.
I'd seen these before, and Bucky was friends with my dad.
I'd seen these before, and Bucky was friends with my dad.
It was modern, high-tech, impressive, a huge 142-foot clear span which, not coincidentally, was exactly its height.
I loved this place.
For the first time, I realized people were smart 2,000 years ago.  This had never crossed my mind.
I mean, to me, the pyramids at Giza, we visited those the year before, and sure they're impressive, nice enough design, but look, give me an unlimited budget, 20,000 to 40,000 laborers, and about 10 to 20 years to cut and drag stone blocks across the countryside, and I'll build you pyramids too.
But no amount of brute force gets you the dome of the Pantheon, not 2,000 years ago, nor today.
The shaft of light beaming through the oculus was both beautiful and palpable, and I realized for the first time that light could be designed.
Further, that of all of the forms of design, visual design, they were all kind of irrelevant without it, because without light, you can't see any of them.
I also realized that I wasn't the first person to think that this place was really special.
So what came after the moon?
One is tempted to say that today's pantheon is the Internet, but I actually think that's quite wrong, or at least it's only part of the story.
The Internet isn't a Pantheon.
They need to be nurtured and encouraged from when they're little kids.
We need to love them and help them discover their passions.
We need to encourage them to work hard and help them understand that failure is a necessary ingredient for success, as is perseverance.
You're not going to get that chance if we mistakenly suspend the account thinking it's spam.
Okay. Let's make the stakes higher.
Back to my account, again exhibiting classic behavior.
But there was no one left to speak for me."
Now, Niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight.
This is an insight at the core of intelligence.
Now, we've mapped that afterglow with great precision, and when I say we, I mean people who aren't me.
We've mapped the afterglow with spectacular precision, and one of the shocks about it is that it's almost completely uniform.
Fourteen billion light years that way and 14 billion light years that way, it's the same temperature.
That is spectacular, and that's not what they found on Monday; what they found on Monday is cooler.
So here's what they found on Monday: Imagine you take a bell, and you whack the bell with a hammer.
What happens? It rings.
I thought, if I could answer those questions, I could make a huge contribution to my city.
But one of the more wonky things about me is that I am an animal behaviorist, and I use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces.
One of the first spaces that I studied was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park in midtown Manhattan.

This little space became a small phenomenon, and because it had such a profound impact on New Yorkers, it made an enormous impression on me.
This little space became a small phenomenon, and because it had such a profound impact on New Yorkers, it made an enormous impression on me.
I studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather, so I knew that places like Paley Park didn't happen by accident.
I saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail.
Now, open spaces in cities are opportunities.
Yes, they are opportunities for commercial investment, but they are also opportunities for the common good of the city, and those two goals are often not aligned with one another, and therein lies the conflict.
The first opportunity I had to fight for a great public open space was in the early 1980s, when I was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River.
Perhaps the High Line didn't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a hill.
Perhaps it was just in their way.
But in any case, it took nine months of nonstop daily negotiation to finally get the signed agreement to prohibit its demolition, and that was only two years ago.
We can shoot images that are thousands of times faster than our vision.
And we can see how nature's ingenious devices work, and perhaps we can even imitate them.
When a dragonfly flutters by, you may not realize, but it's the greatest flier in nature.
We recognized kids had rights, we banned child labor, we focused on education instead, and school became a child's new work.
And thank God it did.
But that only made a parent's role more confusing in a way.
Can I just repeat that?
The content of the original "Sesame Street" is not suitable for children.
When asked about this by The New York Times, a producer for the show gave a variety of explanations.
That's what we want to see. That's why it's hard.
The light from the star is diffracting. It's scattering inside the telescope, creating that very bright image that washes out the planet.
So to see the planet, we have to do something about all of that light.
It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer, the father of the space telescope, in 1962, and he took his inspiration from an eclipse.
You've all seen that. That's a solar eclipse.
The moon has moved in front of the sun.

You've all seen that. That's a solar eclipse.
The moon has moved in front of the sun.
Well the moon is casting a shadow down on the Earth.
We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow, we look back at the sun, and most of the light's been removed and we can see that dim, fine structure in the corona.
Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space.

Type is something we consume in enormous quantities.
In much of the world, it's completely inescapable.
It's my job.
I'm one of the tiny handful of people who gets badly bent out of shape by the bad spacing of the T and the E that you see there.
I've got to take that slide off.
I was asked at this time to design a series of condensed sans serif types with as many different variants as possible within this 18-unit box.
Quickly looking at the arithmetic, I realized I could only actually make three of related design. Here you see them.
In Helvetica Compressed, Extra Compressed, and Ultra Compressed, this rigid 18-unit system really boxed me in.
Clearly I could make more variants, but would these three members of the family be better?
It's hard to say without actually doing it, but they would not be better in the proportion of 1,000 to 18, I can tell you that.
My instinct tells you that any improvement would be rather slight, because they were designed as functions of the system they were designed to fit, and as I said, type is very adaptable.
By accepting a constraint, are you working to a lower standard?
I don't believe so, and I've always been encouraged by something that Charles Eames said.
He said he was conscious of working within constraints, but not of making compromises.
The distinction between a constraint and a compromise is obviously very subtle, but it's very central to my attitude to work.
Remember this reading experience?
The phone book. I'll hold the slide so you can enjoy the nostalgia.
I made a serif type, you can see it on the right, without curved serifs.
I made them polygonal, out of straight line segments, chamfered brackets.
And look, as economical in data as a sans serif.
So Charter is a sort of parable for me, really.
In the end, there was no hard and fast causal link between the technology and the design of Charter.
I had really misunderstood the technology.
I've designed too many faces in the past that were intended to mitigate technical problems.
Thanks to the engineers, the technical problems went away.
So did my typeface.
It's in constantly wanting to close that gap between where you are and where you want to be.
Mastery is about sacrificing for your craft and not for the sake of crafting your career.
How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon?
One of the most vivid examples of this comes when we look at the difference between Olympic silver medalists and bronze medalists after a competition.
Thomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell studied this difference and found that the frustration silver medalists feel compared to bronze, who are typically a bit more happy to have just not received fourth place and not medaled at all, gives silver medalists a focus on follow-up competition.
We see it even in the gambling industry that once picked up on this phenomenon of the near win and created these scratch-off tickets that had a higher than average rate of near wins and so compelled people to buy more tickets that they were called heart-stoppers, and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses in Britain in the 1970s.

The reason the near win has a propulsion is because it changes our view of the landscape and puts our goals, which we tend to put at a distance, into more proximate vicinity to where we stand.
If I ask you to envision what a great day looks like next week, you might describe it in more general terms.
But if I ask you to describe a great day at TED tomorrow, you might describe it with granular, practical clarity.
And this is what a near win does.

The Earth needs no introduction.
It needs no introduction in part because the Apollo 17 astronauts, when they were hurtling around the moon in 1972, took this iconic image.
The Earth needs no introduction.
It needs no introduction in part because the Apollo 17 astronauts, when they were hurtling around the moon in 1972, took this iconic image.
It galvanized a whole generation of human beings to realize that we're on Spaceship Earth, fragile and finite as it is, and that we need to take care of it.
This is not a scale model, this is the real size.
It's 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters, it weighs four kilograms, and we've stuffed the latest and greatest electronics and sensor systems into this little package so that even though this is really small, this can take pictures 10 times the resolution of the big satellite here, even though it weighs one thousandth of the mass.
And we call this satellite "Dove" — Thank you.
So I knew that I had no way to win, and knowing that I had no way to win made me seriously consider for a while just quitting the game and moving to the country to raise corgis.
But if I had done that, if I had given up writing, I would have lost my beloved vocation, so I knew that the task was that I had to find some way to gin up the inspiration to write the next book regardless of its inevitable negative outcome.
In other words, I had to find a way to make sure that my creativity survived its own success.

In other words, I had to find a way to make sure that my creativity survived its own success.
And I did, in the end, find that inspiration, but I found it in the most unlikely and unexpected place.
So think of it like this: For most of your life, you live out your existence here in the middle of the chain of human experience where everything is normal and reassuring and regular, but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here into the blinding darkness of disappointment.
Success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far way out over here into the equally blinding glare of fame and recognition and praise.
And one of these fates is objectively seen by the world as bad, and the other one is objectively seen by the world as good, but your subconscious is completely incapable of discerning the difference between bad and good.
But one of the areas that I'm most excited about using this platform for is applying it to problems that are difficult for computers or people to solve alone.
One example of those is protein folding.
So here we have an interface where we have physical handles onto a protein, and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways.
Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe as being great marathoners.
The Kalenjin make up just 12 percent of the Kenyan population but the vast majority of elite runners.
And they happen, on average, to have a certain unique physiology: legs that are very long and very thin at their extremity, and this is because they have their ancestry in a very hot and dry climate, and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes.

We live in a very complex environment: complexity and dynamism and patterns of evidence from satellite photographs, from videos.
You can even see it outside your window.
MT: Magic creates the illusion of an impossible reality.
Technology can do the same.
Alan Turing, a pioneer of artificial intelligence, spoke about creating the illusion that a machine could think.
You know, in music we take something that we love and we build on it.
I'd like to play a song for you.
That's "La Di Da Di" and it's the fifth-most sampled song of all time.

But the way he interpreted it, as you hear, is completely his own.
He flips it, makes it, there's nothing pastiche whatsoever about it.
It's thoroughly modern Biggie.
It leaves the listener feeling sickly.
You have to take an element of those things and then bring something fresh and new to it, which was something that I learned when I was working with the late, amazing Amy Winehouse on her album "Back to Black."
A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album that myself and Salaam Remi, the other producer, achieved, how we captured this long-lost sound, but without the very, very 21st-century personality and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore and even a mention of Slick Rick, the whole thing would have run the risk of being very pastiche, to be honest.
They smell with their antennae, and they interact with their antennae, so when one ant touches another with its antennae, it can tell, for example, if the other ant and what task that other ant has been doing.
So here you see a lot of ants moving around and interacting in a lab arena that's connected by tubes to two other arenas.
So when one ant meets another, it doesn't matter which ant it meets, and they're actually not transmitting any kind of complicated signal or message.
But the colony gets its water by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds that they eat.
So in this environment, interactions are used to activate foraging.
An outgoing forager doesn't go out unless it gets enough interactions with returning foragers, and what you see are the returning foragers going into the tunnel, into the nest, and meeting outgoing foragers on their way out.
On dry days, some colonies forage less, so colonies are different in how they manage this trade-off between spending water to search for seeds and getting water back in the form of seeds.
And we're trying to understand why some colonies forage less than others by thinking about ants as neurons, using models from neuroscience.
So just as a neuron adds up its stimulation from other neurons to decide whether to fire, an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants to decide whether to forage.
We talk about the brain, but of course every brain is slightly different, and maybe there are some individuals or some conditions in which the electrical properties of neurons are such that they require more stimulus to fire, and that would lead to differences in brain function.
So in order to ask evolutionary questions, we need to know about reproductive success.
This is a map of the study site where I have been tracking this population of harvester ant colonies for 28 years, which is about as long as a colony lives.
So here's an example of ant security.
In the middle, there's an ant plugging the nest entrance with its head in response to interactions with another species.
Those are the little ones running around with their abdomens up in the air.
And I think it's pretty likely that the invasive species, the ones that come into our buildings, are going to be really good at this, because they're in your kitchen because they're really good at finding food and water.
So the most familiar resource for ants is a picnic, and this is a clustered resource.
When there's one piece of fruit, there's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby, and the ants that specialize on clustered resources use interactions for recruitment.
And so we evolved into social animals, where we lived together and worked together in what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe, where we felt like we belonged.
And when we felt safe amongst our own, the natural reaction was trust and cooperation.
There are inherent benefits to this.
"The hour from night to day.
The hour from side to side.
The hour for those past thirty..."
No wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart.
Rives: So the first hour of this project was satisfying.
A Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe.
I have kept this mix tape in a box with notes and postcards, not just from L.D., from my life, but for decades.
It's the kind of box where, if I have a girlfriend, I tend to hide it from her, and if I had a wife, I'm sure I would share it with her, but the story —  — with this mix tape is there are seven songs per side, but no song titles.
Instead, L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress classification system, including page numbers, to leave me clues.
We should obviously do this just because it's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem, but it's also cost-effective.
It turns out fish is the most cost-effective protein on the planet.
If you look at how much fish protein you get per dollar invested compared to all of the other animal proteins, obviously, fish is a good business decision.
It also doesn't need a lot of land, something that's in short supply, compared to other protein sources.
And it doesn't need a lot of fresh water.
It uses a lot less fresh water than, for example, cattle, where you have to irrigate a field so that you can grow the food to graze the cattle.
It also has a very low carbon footprint.
It has a little bit of a carbon footprint because we do have to get out and catch the fish.
It takes a little bit of fuel, but as you know, agriculture can have a carbon footprint, and fish has a much smaller one, so it's less polluting.
It's when fish are labeled as something they're not.
Think about the last time you had fish.
What were you eating?

Approximately 30 years ago, when I was in oncology at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, a father and a son walked into my office and they both had their right eye missing, and as I took the history, it became apparent that the father and the son had a rare form of inherited eye tumor, retinoblastoma, and the father knew that he had passed that fate on to his son.
That moment changed my life.
I would have had an easier life if I were straight, but I would not be me, and I now like being myself better than the idea of being someone else, someone who, to be honest, I have neither the option of being nor the ability fully to imagine.
But if you banish the dragons, you banish the heroes, and we become attached to the heroic strain in our own lives.
I've sometimes wondered whether I could have ceased to hate that part of myself without gay pride's technicolor fiesta, of which this speech is one manifestation.
And I thought — Thank you.
I thought that I was indebted even to Bobby Finkel, because all those earlier experiences were what had propelled me to this moment, and I was finally unconditionally grateful for a life I'd once have done anything to change.
The gay activist Harvey Milk was once asked by a younger gay man what he could do to help the movement, and Harvey Milk said, "Go out and tell someone."

In the middle of the motorcycles, there's a big, black Rolls-Royce.

This is a big deal.
I want to be in that car.  I want a bigger life.
I want a life beyond this town.
I want a life that's out of the ordinary.
It can't even be indifferent.
And if you think about claims about the nonexistence of things, one obvious way to try and establish the nonexistence of a purported thing would be to offer a definition of that thing and then to see whether anything satisfied it.
I'm going to start out on that little route to begin with.
But why do we have such a list?
What's going on? How did it come about that we have this list?
I think the answer is a pretty simple one and therefore crude and contentious.
I think the answer is, European travelers, starting roughly about the time of Columbus, started going around the world.
They came from a Christian culture, and when they arrived in a new place, they noticed that some people didn't have Christianity, and so they asked themselves the following question: what have they got instead of Christianity?
And that list was essentially constructed.
The history of Christianity, the internal history of Christianity, is largely the history of people killing each other because they believed the wrong thing, and it's also involved in struggles with other religions, obviously starting in the Middle Ages, a struggle with Islam, in which, again, it was the infidelity, the fact that they didn't believe the right things, that seemed so offensive to the Christian world.
Now that's a very specific and particular history that Christianity has, and not everywhere is everything that has ever been put on this sort of list like it.
Here's another problem, I think. A very specific thing happened.
Let me give you some data to back up that claim.
So here's a study of change in people's personal values over time.
Here's three values. Everybody here holds all of them, but you probably know that as you grow, as you age, the balance of these values shifts.
We asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would change in the next 10 years, and the others to tell us how much their values had changed in the last 10 years.
And this enabled us to do a really interesting kind of analysis, because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people, say, 18 years old, to the reports of people who were 28, and to do that kind of analysis throughout the lifespan.
Here's what we found.
Most of us can remember who we were 10 years ago, but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be, and then we mistakenly think that because it's hard to imagine, it's not likely to happen.
Sorry, when people say "I can't imagine that," they're usually talking about their own lack of imagination, and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they're describing.
The bottom line is, time is a powerful force.

Now — for a breath I tarry Nor yet disperse apart — Take my hand quick and tell me, What have you in your heart.
Speak now, and I will answer; How shall I help you, say; Ere to the wind's twelve quarters I take my endless way."
[A. E. Housman] Now, this poem has appealed to science fiction writers.
Speak now, and I will answer; How shall I help you, say; Ere to the wind's twelve quarters I take my endless way."
[A. E. Housman] Now, this poem has appealed to science fiction writers.
It's furnished at least three science fiction titles, I think because it says poems can brings us news from the future or the past or across the world, because their patterns can seem to tell you what's in somebody's heart.
It says poems can bring people together temporarily, which I think is true, and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes but for how it rhymes, cleanly and simply on the two and four, "say" and "way," with anticipatory hints on the one and three, "answer" and "quarters," as if the poem itself were coming together.
It plays up the fact that we die by exaggerating the speed of our lives.
A few years on Earth become one speech, one breath.
It's a poem about loneliness -- the "I" in the poem feels no connection will last — and it might look like a plea for help 'til you get to the word "help," where this "I" facing you, taking your hand, is more like a teacher or a genie, or at least that's what he wants to believe.
It would not be the first time a poet had written the poem that he wanted to hear.
Now, this next poem really changed what I liked and what I read and what I felt I could read as an adult.

Big masculine threat, insinuating and slangy."
[Rae Armantrout] Now, I found this poem in an anthology of almost equally confusing poems in 1989.
I just heard that there were these scandalous writers called Language poets who didn't make any sense, and I wanted to go and see for myself what they were like, and some of them didn't do much for me, but this writer, Rae Armantrout, did an awful lot, and I kept reading her until I felt I knew what was going on, as I do with this poem.

It's about the Garden of Eden and the Fall and the Biblical story of the Fall, in which sex as we know it and death and guilt come into the world at the same time.
That's what John Keats is doing in his most mysterious, perhaps, poem.
It's mysterious because it's probably unfinished, he probably left it unfinished, and because it might be meant for a character in a play, but it might just be Keats' thinking about what his own writing, his handwriting, could do, and in it I hear, at least I hear, mortality, and I hear the power of older poetic techniques, and I have the feeling, you might have the feeling, of meeting even for an instant, almost becoming,
someone else from long ago, someone quite memorable.

Very effective.
Robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe.
This is the foot of a cockroach.
And they're really just made up of compliant joints that are tubes and plates connected to one another.
Here's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach.
You see these plates, and you see the compliant membrane.
So in these early mammals, because only mammals have a neocortex, rodent-like creatures.
It was the size of a postage stamp and just as thin, and was a thin covering around their walnut-sized brain, but it was capable of a new type of thinking.
Rather than the fixed behaviors it could invent new behaviors.
Now that went along fine, but then something happened.
Sixty-five million years ago, there was a sudden, violent change to the environment.
We call it the Cretaceous extinction event.
We call it the Cretaceous extinction event.
That's when the dinosaurs went extinct, that's when 75 percent of the animal and plant species went extinct, and that's when mammals overtook their ecological niche, and to anthropomorphize, biological evolution said, "Hmm, this neocortex is pretty good stuff," and it began to grow it.
And mammals got bigger, their brains got bigger at an even faster pace, and the neocortex got bigger even faster than that and developed these distinctive ridges and folds basically to increase its surface area.
Information flows down also.
If the apple recognizer has seen A-P-P-L, it'll think to itself, "Hmm, I think an E is probably likely," and it'll send a signal down to all the E recognizers saying, "Be on the lookout for an E, I think one might be coming."
The E recognizers will lower their threshold and they see some sloppy thing, could be an E.
They're physically putting their bodies on the line between the whalers' harpoons and the whales.
These are everyday people, like these protesters in Italy who spontaneously climbed over barbed wire fences to rescue beagles from animal testing.
And these movements have been incredibly effective and popular, so in 1985, their opponents made up a new word, to shift how we view them.
They just made it up.
Now these companies have backed new laws like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, which turns activism into terrorism if it causes a loss of profits.
Now most people never even heard about this law, including members of Congress.
She was pretty and she could rollerblade, but being a hacker, that made her powerful.
And I wanted to be just like her, so I started spending a lot of time on hacker chat rooms and online forums.
I remember one late night I found a bit of PHP code.

But what if you could read your ex's emails, or add a couple zeros to your bank account.
What would you do then?
Indeed, many hackers do not resist those temptations, and so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year to fraud, malware or plain old identity theft, which is a serious issue.
This is what happened last year when another security researcher called Kyle Lovett discovered a gaping hole in the design of certain wireless routers like you might have in your home or office.
He learned that anyone could remotely connect to these devices over the Internet and download documents from hard drives attached to those routers, no password needed.
He reported it to the company, of course, but they ignored his report.
These are usually great arrangements for companies to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities they find in their code.
Unfortunately, due to some miscommunications, his report was not acknowledged.
Frustrated with the exchange, he took to use his own discovery to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall.
This universal hacker movement needs no introduction today, but six years ago they were not much more than an Internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and Internet trolling campaigns.
Their moment of transformation was in early 2008 when the Church of Scientology attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites.
This is when Anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of Internet dwellers.

They have been called many names from criminals to terrorists, and I cannot justify their illegal means, but the ideas they fight for are ones that matter to us all.
The reality is, hackers can do a lot more than break things.
They can bring people together.
They come from all walks of life, ethnicities, ideologies and genders, I might add.
They are now shaping the world's stage.
Hackers represent an exceptional force for change This is because access to information is a critical currency of power, one which governments would like to control, a thing they attempt to do by setting up all-you-can-eat surveillance programs, a thing they need hackers for, by the way.
My dinner companion and I both know what the verb "defriend" means, so when does a new word like "defriend" become real?
Who has the authority to make those kinds of official decisions about words, anyway?
Those are the questions I want to talk about today.
There are going to be changes where you think, "Really?
Does the language have to change that way?"
What I'm saying is, we should be less quick to decide that that change is terrible, we should be less quick to impose our likes and dislikes about words on other people, and we should be entirely reluctant to think that the English language is in trouble.
The language is not going to change so fast that we can't keep up.
Language just doesn't work that way.
I hope that what you can do is find language change not worrisome but fun and fascinating, just the way dictionary editors do.

So how does a word get into a dictionary?

I hope you can enjoy being part of the creativity that is continually remaking our language and keeping it robust.
So how does a word get into a dictionary?
It gets in because we use it and we keep using it, and dictionary editors are paying attention to us.
If you're thinking, "But that lets all of us decide what words mean," I would say, "Yes it does, and it always has."
Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource, but there is no objective dictionary authority out there that is the final arbiter about what words mean.
Suppose the bank, wooing you, adds 500 dollars a month to your salary.
Does the extra money now make the banking job better than the artist one?
Not necessarily.

A higher salary makes the banking job better than it was before, but it might not be enough to make being a banker better than being an artist.

This response in hard choices is a rational response, but it's not dictated by reasons given to us.
I had really interesting friends and colleagues, I had a nice apartment on Park Avenue and 20th Street.
I had, to me, a fascinating job writing about world affairs, but I could never separate myself enough from them to hear myself think -- or really, to understand if I was truly happy.
And so, I abandoned my dream life for a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto, Japan, which was the place that had long exerted a strong, really mysterious gravitational pull on me.
I have never once had to use a cell phone there.
I almost never have to look at the time, and every morning when I wake up, really the day stretches in front of me like an open meadow.
And when life throws up one of its nasty surprises, as it will, more than once, when a doctor comes into my room wearing a grave expression, or a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway, I know, in my bones, that it's the time I've spent going nowhere that is going to sustain me much more than all the time I've spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island.
And I wasn't entirely surprised when the record that he released at the age of 77, to which he gave the deliberately unsexy title of "Old Ideas," went to number one in the charts in 17 nations in the world, hit the top five in nine others.
Something in us, I think, is crying out for the sense of intimacy and depth that we get from people like that.
who take the time and trouble to sit still.
Of this world saying “it is good" So I may not always come before you with excellency of speech But do not judge me by my language and assume That I’m too ignorant to teach ‘Cause I speak three tongues One for each: Home, school and friends I’m a tri-lingual orator Sometimes I’m consistent with my language now Then switch it up so I don’t bore later Sometimes I fight back two tongues
While I use the other one in the classroom And when I mistakenly mix them up I feel crazy like … I’m cooking in the bathroom I know that I had to borrow your language because mines was stolen But you can’t expect me to speak your history wholly while mines is broken These words are spoken By someone who is simply fed up with the Eurocentric ideals of this season
And the reason I speak a composite version of your language Is because mines was raped away along with my history I speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind us That our current state is not a mystery I’m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad So unless you’ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad I’m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity
So the first thing we did is, we got a bag of candy bars and we walked around campus and talked to students, faculty and staff, and asked them for information about their passwords.
Now we didn't say, "Give us your password."
No, we just asked them about their password.
Now we didn't say, "Give us your password."
No, we just asked them about their password.
How long is it? Does it have a digit?
So we used a service called Amazon Mechanical Turk, and this is a service where you can post a small job online that takes a minute, a few minutes, an hour, and pay people, a penny, ten cents, a few dollars, to do a task for you, and then you pay them through Amazon.com.
So we paid people about 50 cents to create a password following our rules and answering a survey, and then we paid them again to come back two days later and log in using their password and answering another survey.
So we did this, and we collected 5,000 passwords, and we gave people a bunch of different policies to create passwords with.
Again we see that there's only a small number of symbols that people are actually using in their passwords.
We also wanted to get an idea of how strong the passwords were that people were creating, but as you may recall, there isn't a good measure of password strength.
So what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using, or that we could find information about in the research literature.

So what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using, or that we could find information about in the research literature.
They tell you you're doing a good job too early, and if they would just wait a little bit before giving you that positive feedback, you probably would have better passwords.
Now another approach to better passwords, perhaps, is to use pass phrases instead of passwords.
So this was an xkcd cartoon from a couple of years ago, and the cartoonist suggests that we should all use pass phrases, and if you look at the second row of this cartoon, you can see the cartoonist is suggesting that the pass phrase "correct horse battery staple" would be a very strong pass phrase and something really easy to remember.
So that was good news.
Okay, I want to close by talking about some insights I gained while on sabbatical last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school.
One of the things that I did is I made a number of quilts, and I made this quilt here.

The human voice: It's the instrument we all play.
It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably.




I've been thinking a lot about the world recently and how it's changed over the last 20, 30, 40 years.
Twenty or 30 years ago, if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died in a remote village in East Asia, it would have been a tragedy for the chicken and its closest relatives, but I don't think there was much possibility of us fearing a global pandemic and the deaths of millions.
A lot of us are not aware of the extraordinary successes of the Millennium Development Goals, several of which have achieved their targets long before the due date.
That proves that this species of humanity is capable of achieving extraordinary progress if it really acts together and it really tries hard.
But if I had to put it in a nutshell these days, I sort of feel that globalization has taken us by surprise, and we've been slow to respond to it.
And this is a question we need to ask ourselves.
I think constantly we have to monitor it.
Are we and our politicians to a degree cultural psychopaths?
You get more tourists. You get more investors.
You sell your products more expensively.
If, on the other hand, you have a country with a very weak or a very negative image, everything is difficult and everything is expensive.

There's Germany at 13th, the U.S. comes 21st, Mexico comes 66th, and then we have some of the big developing countries, like Russia at 95th, China at 107th.
Countries like China and Russia and India, which is down in the same part of the index, well, in some ways, it's not surprising.
over the last decades building their own economy, building their own society and their own polity, but it is to be hoped that the second phase of their growth will be somewhat more outward-looking than the first phase has been so far.
And then you can break down each country in terms of the actual datasets that build into it.
From midnight tonight it's going to be on goodcountry.org, You can look right down to the level of the individual datasets.
Now that's the Good Country Index.
And everybody in the last 15 seconds before they drift off to sleep at night will say, "Gosh, I'm glad that person's country exists."
Ultimately, that, I think, is what will make the change.
That word, "good," and the number 6.8 and the discovery that's behind it have changed my life.
That word, "good," and the number 6.8 and the discovery that's behind it have changed my life.
I think they can change your life, and I think we can use it to change the way that our politicians and our companies behave, and in doing so, we can change the world.
I've started thinking very differently about my own country since I've been thinking about these things.
And so I engaged my father after dinner in long, sometimes heated conversations.
We had many, many conversations like that, and what I got from them was my father's wisdom.
He was the one that suffered the most under those conditions of imprisonment, and yet he understood American democracy.
They were sent out on the most dangerous missions and they sustained the highest combat casualty rate of any unit proportionally.
There is one battle that illustrates that.
It was a battle for the Gothic Line.
They clung to their belief in the shining ideals of this country, and they proved that being an American is not just for some people, that race is not how we define being an American.
They expanded what it means to be an American, including Japanese-Americans that were feared and suspected and hated.
They were change agents, and they left for me a legacy.
Now I want to tell one last story, that of a 22-year-old law student in Algeria named Amel Zenoune-Zouani who had the same dreams of a legal career that I did back in the '90s.
She refused to give up her studies, despite the fact that the fundamentalists battling the Algerian state back then threatened all who continued their education.
On January 26, 1997, Amel boarded the bus in Algiers where she was studying to go home and spend a Ramadan evening with her family, and would never finish law school.
Shortly before her death, Amel had said to her mother of herself and her sisters, "Nothing will happen to us, Inshallah, God willing, but if something happens, you must know that we are dead for knowledge.
You and father must keep your heads held high."
The loss of such a young woman is unfathomable, and so as I did my research I found myself searching for Amel's hope again and her name even means "hope" in Arabic.
I looked at this woman in shock.
"Sperm donor? What's the rush?"
She said, "I'm turning 40 at the end of this year, and I've been so bad in choosing men in my life."
Ignorance and denial are on the rise.
Now, in regard to the current economic crisis, we think that we will just wake up again and everything will be the same as before, and no political or social changes are needed.
In regard to ecological crisis, we think nothing needs to be done just now, or others need to act before us.
Okay, maybe they don't think that they will make it in the future, but maybe they think, my son might become the next Bill Gates.
And who would want to tax one's son?
Or, a question for me is also, why would people who have no health insurance not embrace universal healthcare?
First, I realized a lot of choice I make is not rational.
It's linked to my unconscious, my guesses of what others are choosing, or what is a socially embraced choice.
I also embrace the idea that we should go beyond thinking about individual choices, that it's very important to rethink social choices, since this ideology of individual choice has pacified us.
And then inserts these long, thin instruments and a camera, and actually does the procedure inside the patient.
This is great because there's much less risk of infection, much less pain, shorter recovery time.
But there is a trade-off, because these incisions are created with a long, pointed device called a trocar.
But there is a trade-off, because these incisions are created with a long, pointed device called a trocar.
And the way the surgeon uses this device is that he takes it and he presses it into the abdomen until it punctures through.
And now the reason why everyone in the operating room was staring at that device on that day was because he had to be absolutely careful not to plunge it through and puncture it into the organs and blood vessels below.
And now the reason why everyone in the operating room was staring at that device on that day was because he had to be absolutely careful not to plunge it through and puncture it into the organs and blood vessels below.
But this problem should seem pretty familiar to all of you because I'm pretty sure you've seen it somewhere else.
Remember this?
This is about 2,000 frames a second, and I'd like you to notice the tip that's right there on the bottom, about to puncture through tissue.
And you'll see that right at the moment of puncture, right there, the mechanism unlocks and retracts that tip back.
I want to show it to you again, a little closer up.
You're going to see the sharp bladed tip, and right when it punctures that rubber membrane it's going to disappear into this white blunt sheath.
Right there.
That happens within four 100ths of a second after puncture.
It took about 30 minutes to do this, but it worked.
And it proved to me that my idea worked and it justified the next couple years of work on this project.
I worked on this because this problem really fascinated me.

It kept me up at night.
So it's easy to think that for every major problem out there there's some team of experts working around the clock to solve it.
The truth is that's not always the case.
We have to be better at finding those problems and finding ways to solve them.
I would take things like highlighter pen, mix it with water, pump it through plastic tubing, creating these glowing circulatory systems for people to walk through and enjoy.
I like these materials because of the way they look, the way they feel, and they're very affordable.
I also liked to make devices that work with body parts.
This is an automatic night light.
Some of you might have them at home.
I would cut out the light sensor, add an extension line, and use modeling clay, stick it onto the television, and then I would videotape my eye, and using the dark part of my eye tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time, so you turn on the lightbulb.

I'd like to introduce you to an organism: a slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.
It's a mold with an identity crisis, because it's not a mold, so let's get that straight to start with.
It is one of 700 known slime molds belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba.
It is a single-celled organism, a cell, that joins together with other cells to form a mass super-cell to maximize its resources.
So within a slime mold you might find thousands or millions of nuclei, all sharing a cell wall, all operating as one entity.
In its natural habitat, you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands, eating rotting vegetation, but you might equally find it in research laboratories, classrooms, and even artists' studios.
I first came across the slime mold about five years ago.
A microbiologist friend of mine gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it and told me to go home and play with it.
The only instructions I was given, that it likes it dark and damp and its favorite food is porridge oats.
I'm an artist who's worked for many years with biology, with scientific processes, so living material is not uncommon for me.
I've worked with plants, bacteria, cuttlefish, fruit flies.

It formed a connection between food sources.
I watched it leave a trail behind it, indicating where it had been.
I captured my observations through time-lapse photography.
Slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour, so it's not really ideal for live viewing unless there's some form of really extreme meditation, but through the time lapse, I could observe some really interesting behaviors.
For instance, having fed on a nice pile of oats, the slime mold goes off to explore new territories in different directions simultaneously.
It doesn't like it dry.
They did this at repeat intervals, and each time, the slime mold slowed down its growth in response.
However, at the next interval, the researchers didn't put the cold air on, yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation of it happening.
It somehow knew that it was about the time for the cold air that it didn't like.
The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn.
A third experiment: the slime mold was invited to explore a territory covered in oats.

As it goes, each food node it finds, it forms a network, a connection to, and keeps foraging.

After 26 hours, it established quite a firm network between the different oats.
What had taken us well over 100 years took the slime mold just over a day.
The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold can form efficient networks and solve the traveling salesman problem.
It is a biological computer.

It is a biological computer.
As such, it has been mathematically modeled, algorithmically analyzed.
It's been sonified, replicated, simulated.
World over, teams of researchers are decoding its biological principles to understand its computational rules and applying that learning to the fields of electronics, programming and robotics.
So the question is, how does this thing work?

It doesn't have a central nervous system.
So the question is, how does this thing work?
It doesn't have a central nervous system.
It doesn't have a brain, yet it can perform behaviors that we associate with brain function.
It can learn, it can remember, it can solve problems, it can make decisions.
So where does that intelligence lie?
So this is a microscopy, a video I shot, and it's about 100 times magnification, sped up about 20 times, and inside the slime mold, there is a rhythmic pulsing flow, a vein-like structure carrying cellular material, nutrients and chemical information through the cell, streaming first in one direction and then back in another.
Just a few examples: an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum; a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with 3D printing technologies in a workshop; another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map their area.
Here, the slime mold is being used directly as a biological tool, but metaphorically as a symbol for ways of talking about social cohesion, communication and cooperation.
Other public engagement activities, I run lots of slime mold workshops, a creative way of engaging with the organism.
We didn't just give them oats.
We gave them beer as well.
But they weren't as efficient as the slime mold, and the slime mold, for me, is a fascinating subject matter.
It's biologically fascinating, it's computationally interesting, but it's also a symbol, a way of engaging with ideas of community, collective behavior, cooperation.
A lot of my work draws on the scientific research, so this pays homage to the maze experiment but in a different way.
And the slime mold is also my working material.
And the slime mold is also my working material.
It's a coproducer of photographs, prints, animations, participatory events.
Whilst the slime mold doesn't choose to work with me, exactly, it is a collaboration of sorts.

I can predict certain behaviors by understanding how it operates, but I can't control it.
The slime mold has the final say in the creative process.
We use this sound pedagogical model to encourage our students from all over the world to interact and study together and also to reduce the time our professors need to labor over class assignments.
If the Internet has made us a global village, this model can develop its future leadership.
Look how we do it.
They're usually referred to as a model figure, a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs.
This particular drawing is of a process called clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
It's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell.
Now we're looking inside.
Clathrin are these three-legged molecules that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes.
Through connections with a membrane, clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle, that's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell.
The process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to crystalize and refine their own ideas.
One researcher I worked with who works on the molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were related directly to the animation that she and I worked on together, and in this way, animation can feed back into the research process.
I believe that animation can change biology.
I didn't know when I agreed to do this whether I was expected to talk or to sing.
But when I was told that the topic was language, I felt that I had to speak about something for a moment.
I have a problem.
I get through it that way for my job.
But as an artist who feels that their work is based solely on a platform of honesty and being real, that feels often like cheating.
Which is why before I sing, I wanted to tell you what singing means to me.

It's more than feeling known, or understood.
It must be so hard teaching those poor, unintelligent kids," I bit my lip, because apparently we needed her money more than my students needed their dignity.
We spend so much time listening to the things people are saying that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't.
Silence is the residue of fear.
It is feeling your flaws gut-wrench guillotine your tongue.
It is the air retreating from your chest because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs.
Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina.
Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina.
It is what you hear when there aren't enough body bags left.
It is the sound after the noose is already tied.
Also, lots of things which are less visible.
The healthcare, late at night when they're worried about what sort of cancer somebody they care about might have, when they just talk across the Internet to somebody who they care about very much in another country.
Those sorts of things are not, they're not out there, and in fact they've acquired a certain amount of privacy.
We can tweet, and oh, lots and lots of people can see our tweets, except when they can't, except when actually Twitter is blocked from their country, or in some way the way we try to express ourselves has put some information about the state of ourselves, the state of the country we live in, which isn't available to anybody else.
So we must protest and make sure that censorship is cut down, that the web is opened up where there is censorship.
We love the fact that the web is open.
They're feeding our children every single day, and before a child can learn, their belly needs to be full, and these women and men are working on the front lines to create an educated society.
So I hope that you don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day to say thank you to your lunch staff, and I hope that you remember how powerful a thank you can be.
A thank you can change a life.

This plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub that actually compromised the urban integrity of the medina, that has the largest pedestrian network in the world.
And right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here, right next to the plaza, you can see that the river looked like a river of trash.
Instead, what we proposed is to make the plaza entirely pedestrian, to cover it with recycled leather canopies, and to connect it to the banks of the river.

Instead, what we proposed is to make the plaza entirely pedestrian, to cover it with recycled leather canopies, and to connect it to the banks of the river.
The second site of intervention is also an urban void along the river banks, and it used to be an illegal parking, and we proposed to transform it into the first playground in the medina.
And it turns out we're actually so much more complicated than that.
So one great thing that has happened to me is recently I published a book on this, and every day now that I open my email or when I go to a reading or even when I go to a cocktail party, people tell me their stories of the animals that they have met.
And recently, I did a reading in California, and a woman raised her hand after the talk and she said, "Dr. Braitman, I think my cat has PTSD."
We fret too much about minor hazards — improbable air crashes, carcinogens in food, low radiation doses, and so forth — but we and our political masters are in denial about catastrophic scenarios.
The worst have thankfully not yet happened.
Indeed, they probably won't.
So as I said in my book, we'll have a bumpy ride through this century.
There may be setbacks to our society — indeed, a 50 percent chance of a severe setback.
But are there conceivable events that could be even worse, events that could snuff out all life?
She called India a traveler's heaven and a woman's hell.
She said she was stalked, groped, and masturbated at.
Now, late that evening, the report went viral.
She said she was stalked, groped, and masturbated at.
Now, late that evening, the report went viral.
It was on news channels across the world.
Now, late that evening, the report went viral.
It was on news channels across the world.
Everyone was discussing it.
It had over a million views, a thousand comments and shares, and I found myself witnessing a very similar thing.
The media was caught in this vicious cycle of opinion and outburst and no outcome whatsoever.
So that night, as I sat wondering how I should respond, I found myself filled with doubt.
Empowerment is often made to sound as if it's an ideal, it's a wonderful outcome.
When we talk about empowerment, we often talk about giving people access to materials, giving them access to tools.
But the thing is, empowerment is an emotion.
This is the view of the night sky that you would see, and it's a beautiful view, with the Milky Way just peeking out over the horizon.
but it's also a static view, and in many ways, this is the way we think of our universe: eternal and unchanging.
But the universe is anything but static.
Well, you build the largest digital camera in history, using the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone or in the digital cameras you can buy in the High Street, but now at a scale that is five and a half feet across, about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, where one image is three billion pixels.
So if you wanted to look at an image in its full resolution, just a single LSST image, it would take about 1,500 high-definition TV screens.
And this camera will image the sky, taking a new picture every 20 seconds, constantly scanning the sky so every three nights, we'll get a completely new view of the skies above Chile.
Every foot of distance you look away, or every foot of distance an object is away, you're looking back about a billionth of a second in time, and this idea or this notion of looking back in time has revolutionized our ideas about the universe, not once but multiple times.
The first time was in 1929, when an astronomer called Edwin Hubble showed that the universe was expanding, leading to the ideas of the Big Bang.
And the observations were simple: just 24 galaxies and a hand-drawn picture.
Small changes turn our understanding of the universe on its head.
So 42 supernovae, slightly too faint, meaning slightly further away, requiring that a universe must not just be expanding, but this expansion must be accelerating, revealing a component of our universe which we now call dark energy, a component that drives this expansion and makes up 68 percent of the energy budget of our universe today.
So what is the next revolution likely to be?
She is always happy and eternally young.
What have I lost in the last decades?
People, of course, places, and the boundless energy of my youth, and I'm beginning to lose independence, and that scares me.
I don't see it as weakness anymore.
And I've gained spirituality.
I'm aware that before, death was in the neighborhood.

Why does the universe exist?
Why is there — Okay. Okay.  This is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn.
Any Einsteins? Show of hands? No? No? No? No Einsteins? Okay.
So this question, why is there something rather than nothing, this sublime question, was posed rather late in intellectual history.
It was towards the end of the 17th century, the philosopher Leibniz who asked it, a very smart guy, Leibniz, who invented the calculus independently of Isaac Newton, at about the same time, but for Leibniz, who asked why is there something rather than nothing, this was not a great mystery.
He doesn't need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of.
He can make it out of sheer nothingness, creation ex nihilo.
And by the way, this is what most Americans today believe.
And to a Buddhist, the world is just a whole lot of nothing.
It's just a big cosmic vacuity.
And we think there's a lot of something out there but that's because we're enslaved by our desires.
Now, Lawrence thinks he's an atheist, but he's still in thrall to a religious worldview.
He sees physical laws as being like divine commands.
The laws of quantum field theory for him are like fiat lux, "Let there be light."
I think that Brian Greene is in the audience, and he has written a book called "The Elegant Universe."
He claims that the universe we live in mathematically is very elegant.
Don't believe him.  It's a pious hope, I wish it were true, but I think the other day he admitted to me it's really an ugly universe.
Don't believe him.  It's a pious hope, I wish it were true, but I think the other day he admitted to me it's really an ugly universe.
It's stupidly constructed, it's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants and mass ratios and superfluous families of elementary particles, and what the hell is dark energy?
It's a stick and bubble gum contraption.
It's not an elegant universe.  And then there's the best of all possible worlds in an ethical sense. You should get solemn now, because a world in which sentient beings don't suffer needlessly, in which there aren't things like childhood cancer or the Holocaust.
This is an ethical conception.
Anyway, so between nothingness and the fullest possible reality, various special realities.
And these realities, is there a deity in any of these realities?
Maybe, but the deity isn't perfect like the Judeo-Christian deity.
The deity isn't all-good and all-powerful.

I'm an industrial engineer.
The goal in my life has always been to make more and more products in the least amount of time and resources.


For over a decade as a doctor, I've cared for homeless veterans, for working-class families.
For over a decade as a doctor, I've cared for homeless veterans, for working-class families.
I've cared for people who live and work in conditions that can be hard, if not harsh, and that work has led me to believe that we need a fundamentally different way of looking at healthcare. We simply need a healthcare system that moves beyond just looking at the symptoms that bring people into clinics, but instead actually is able to look and improve health where it begins.
And where health begins is not in the four walls of a doctor's office, but where we live and where we work, where we eat, sleep, learn and play, where we spend the majority of our lives.
She came into our clinic with a chronic headache.
This headache had been going on for a number of years, and this particular episode was very, very troubling. In fact, three weeks before she came to visit us for the first time, she went to an emergency room in Los Angeles.
The emergency room doctors said, "We've run some tests, Veronica.
Do you have mold? Do you have water leaks?
Do you have roaches in your home?"
Turns out, Veronica said yes to three of those things: roaches, water leaks, mold.
All together, living and working conditions account for 60 percent of preventable death.
Let me give you an example of what this feels like.
Let's say there was a company, a tech startup that came to you and said, "We have a great product.
We can start by simply going to our doctors and our nurses, to our clinics, and asking, "Is there something in where I live and where I work that I should be aware of?"
Are there barriers to health that I'm just not aware of, and more importantly, if there are barriers that I'm surfacing, if I'm coming to you and I'm saying I think have a problem with my apartment or at my workplace or I don't have access to transportation, or there's a park that's way too far, so sorry doctor, I can't take your advice to go and jog, if those problems exist,
then doctor, are you willing to listen?
Health is a common good.
It comes from our personal investment in knowing that our lives matter, the context of where we live and where we work, eat, and sleep, matter, and that what we do for ourselves, we also should do for those whose living and working conditions again, can be hard, if not harsh.
We can all invest in making sure that we improve the allocation of resources upstream, but at the same time work together and show that we can move healthcare upstream.
And everything looks normal except the children's faces.
You can see the faces, but they don't look distinctive, and none of them looks familiar, and it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon that you find your daughter.
This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces actually happens to people.
In fact, it's my brain.
We're going through slices through my head like that.
That's my nose over on the right, and now we're going over here, right there.
I went into the scanner, I lay on my back, I held my head as still as I could while staring at pictures of faces like these and objects like these and faces and objects for hours.
So as somebody who has pretty close to the world record of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner, I can tell you that one of the skills that's really important for MRI research is bladder control.
When I got out of the scanner, I did a quick analysis of the data, looking for any parts of my brain that produced a higher response when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects, and here's what I saw.

Now this image looks just awful by today's standards, but at the time I thought it was beautiful.
So I got back in the scanner, I looked at more faces and I looked at more objects and I got a similar blob, and then I did it again and around about then I decided to believe it was for real.
But still, maybe this is something weird about my brain and no one else has one of these things in there, so to find out, we scanned a bunch of other people and found that pretty much everyone has that little face-processing region in a similar neighborhood of the brain.
So the next question was, what does this thing really do?
So the next question was, what does this thing really do?
Is it really specialized just for face recognition?
Well, maybe not, right?
Is it really specialized just for face recognition?
Well, maybe not, right?
Maybe it responds not only to faces but to any body part.
Imagine taking the skull off and looking at the surface of the brain like that.
Okay, now as you can see, the surface of the brain is all folded up.
So that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there.
I'm doing this with that region of my brain right now when I realize that you guys are probably now wondering about all that gray, uncharted territory in the brain, and what's up with that?
Well, I'm wondering about that too, and we're running a bunch of experiments in my lab right now to try to find a number of other possible specializations in the brain for other very specific mental functions.
But importantly, I don't think we have for every important mental function, even mental functions that may be critical for survival.
With diffusion imaging, you can trace bundles of neurons that connect to different parts of the brain, and with this method shown here, you can trace the connections of individual neurons in the brain, potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram of the entire human brain.
Third, how does all of this very systematic structure get built, both over development in childhood and over the evolution of our species?
To address questions like that, scientists are now scanning other species of animals, and they're also scanning human infants.
And we go to the next question.
In the last 20 years, how did the percentage of people in the world who live in extreme poverty change?
Extreme poverty — not having enough food for the day.
"I bet no member of the media passed the test," he said.
So Ola told me, "Take these devices.
You are invited to media conferences.
It helped us generalize and jump to conclusions very, very fast.
It helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of, and we seek causality where there is none, and we then get an illusion of confidence where we believe that we are the best car drivers, above the average.
Everybody answered that question, "Yeah, I drive cars better."

Everybody answered that question, "Yeah, I drive cars better."
Okay, this was good evolutionarily, but now when it comes to the worldview, it is the exact reason why it's upside down.
And then we poll the public and see where they score worst.
So we get a shorter list with the terrible results, like some few examples from Hans, and we have no problem finding these kinds of terrible results.
Okay, this little shortlist, what are we going to do with it?
Today it's 50/50.
The Western domination is over, as of today.
That's nice. So what's going to happen next?
And she was like, "Why?"
And I was like, "Well, when you throw the fruit in the ivy, pretty soon, it's going to be overgrown with melons," which is why I think I ended up telling stories to children and not being a nutritionist for children.
And so Riley was like, "That will never happen.
And Riley knew she didn't grow a melon in seven days, but she also knew that she did, and it's a weird place, but it's not just a place that kids can get to.
It's anything. Art can get us to that place.
She was right in that place in the middle, that place which you could call art or fiction.
And so I try to do this in my books.
And here's just one example.
This is the first book that I ever made.
And here's just one example.

It's called "Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem."

I first visited Beijing 25 years ago to teach at the People's University of China.
China was getting serious about market economics and about university education, so they decided to call in the foreign experts.
Like most other people, I moved around Beijing by bicycle.
We can do that, but we have to think, we have to invest, we have to plan.
Let me turn to energy. Now, energy over the last 25 years has increased by about 50 percent.
Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels.
Let me turn to energy. Now, energy over the last 25 years has increased by about 50 percent.

Over the next 20 years, perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so.
But we're losing our forests.
In the last decade, we've lost a forest area the size of Portugal, and much more has been degraded.
But we're already seeing that we can do so much about that.
So what is new about big data? What is the big deal?
Well, to answer that question, let's think about what information looked like, physically looked like in the past.
In 1908, on the island of Crete, archaeologists discovered a clay disc.

Take, for example, Martin Luther.
If we wanted to know in the 1500s where Martin Luther was, we would have to follow him at all times, maybe with a feathery quill and an inkwell, and record it, but now think about what it looks like today.
You know that somewhere, probably in a telecommunications carrier's database, there is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry that records your information of where you've been at all times.

You figure it out.
You figure it out that that is a traffic light, that that traffic light is red and not green, that that means that you need to stop and not go forward."
Machine learning is at the basis of many of the things that we do online: search engines, Amazon's personalization algorithm, computer translation, voice recognition systems.
Big data is going to transform how we live, how we work and how we think.
It is going to help us manage our careers and lead lives of satisfaction and hope and happiness and health, but in the past, we've often looked at information technology and our eyes have only seen the T, the technology, the hardware, because that's what was physical.
We now need to recast our gaze at the I, the information, which is less apparent, but in some ways a lot more important.

I've been a critical care EMT for the past seven years in Suffolk County, New York.
I've been a first responder in a number of incidents ranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy.
In fact, there are three patterns I have observed in all these cases.
The first pattern always kind of shocked me.
Regardless of religious belief or cultural background, there's a need for forgiveness.
If you're a washer, then you use water for anal cleansing. That's the technical term.
And if you're a wiper, then you use toilet paper or, in some regions of the world where it's not available, newspaper or rags or corncobs.
And this is not just a piece of trivia, but it's really important to understand and solve the sanitation problem.
And it is a big problem: There are 2.5 billion people in the world who don't have access to adequate sanitation.
For them, there's no modern toilet.
And there are 1.1 billion people whose toilets are the streets or river banks or open spaces, and again, the technical term for that is open defecation, but that is really simply shitting in the open.

And the answer is, it's just not possible.
In some of these areas, there's not enough water, there's no energy, it's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars to lay out the sewer lines and to build the facilities and to operate and maintain these systems, and if you don't build it right, you're going to have flush toilets that basically go straight into the river, just like what's happening in many cities in the developing world.
And is this really the solution?
Dozens of projects give us an inkling of what they're capable of doing.
Take the Garífuna grads.
They not only went to work back home, but they organized their communities to build Honduras' first indigenous hospital.
So pay attention to the green box as I move forward.
In seeking and identifying employees with high potential, the potential to go to the top of organizations, the skills and competencies that relate to that green box are rated twice as heavily as those in the other two elements of leadership.
These skills and competencies can be summarized as business, strategic, and financial acumen.
Which element of leadership does that equate to?
Engaging the greatness in others.
And then they pretty much stopped.

And then they pretty much stopped.
When organizations direct women toward resources that focus on the conventional advice that we've been hearing for over 40 years, there's a notable absence of advice that relates to business, strategic and financial acumen.
Much of the advice is emphasizing personal actions that we need to take, like become more assertive, become more confident, develop your personal brand, things that Tonya's been working on, and advice about working with other people, things like learn to self-promote, get a mentor, enhance your network, and virtually nothing said about the importance of business, strategic and financial acumen.
This doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant.
In other words, the term we use in business is, we have to have strategic alignment.
And executives know this very well, and yet only 37 percent, according to a recent Conference Board report, believe that they have that strategic alignment in place.
So for 63 percent of organizations, achieving their strategic financial goals is questionable.
So for 63 percent of organizations, achieving their strategic financial goals is questionable.
And if you think about what I've just shared, that you have situations where at least 50 percent of your middle managers haven't received clear messaging that they have to become focused on the business, where it's headed, and their role in taking it there, it's not surprising that that percentage of executives who are confident about alignment is so low, which is why there are other people who have a role to play in this.
It's important for directors on boards to expect from their executives proportional pools of women when they sit down once a year for their succession discussions.
After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide."
Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.
I check and —  I check that email account religiously all the time.
The range of behavioral options that we consider when we think we're being watched severely reduce.
This is just a fact of human nature that has been recognized in social science and in literature and in religion and in virtually every field of discipline.
There are dozens of psychological studies that prove that when somebody knows that they might be watched, the behavior they engage in is vastly more conformist and compliant.
There are all kinds of reasons why we should want to avoid that lesson as well.
You may be a person who, right now, doesn't want to engage in that behavior, but at some point in the future you might.
Even if you're somebody who decides that you never want to, the fact that there are other people who are willing to and able to resist and be adversarial to those in power — dissidents and journalists and activists and a whole range of others — is something that brings us all collective good that we should want to preserve.

Equally critical is that the measure of how free a society is is not how it treats its good, obedient, compliant citizens, but how it treats its dissidents and those who resist orthodoxy.
But the most important reason is that a system of mass surveillance suppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways.
But the most important reason is that a system of mass surveillance suppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways.
It renders off-limits all kinds of behavioral choices without our even knowing that it's happened.
The renowned socialist activist Rosa Luxemburg once said, "He who does not move does not notice his chains."
About 40 percent of those members are young people aged 20 to 29.
That is one in every 15 young people of that age in Rio today.
Amongst our members is this adorable little girl, Bia, to your right, and Bia was just 11 years old when she started a campaign using one of our tools to save her model public school from demolition.
Why aren't people washing their hands?
Why is it that Mayank, this young boy that I met in India, isn't washing his hands?
Well, in Mayank's family, soap is used for bathing, soap is used for laundry, soap is used for washing dishes.

The profit motive is transforming health outcomes in this world.
But it's been happening for centuries: the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894 in Victorian England to actually combat cholera.
Last week, I was in Ghana with the minister of health, because if you don't know, there's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment.
We are a team of scientists and technologists from Chile, Panama, Mexico, Israel and Greece, and based on recent scientific discoveries, we believe that we have found a reliable and accurate way of detecting several types of cancer at the very early stages through a blood sample.
We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules that circulate freely in our blood called microRNAs.
To explain what microRNAs are and their important role in cancer, I need to start with proteins, because when cancer is present in our body, protein modification is observed in all cancerous cells.
So microRNAs are small molecules that regulate gene expression.
Unlike DNA, which is mainly fixed, microRNAs can vary depending on internal and environmental conditions at any given time, telling us which genes are actively expressed at that particular moment.
And that is what makes microRNAs such a promising biomarker for cancer, because as you know, cancer is a disease of altered gene expression.
And that is what makes microRNAs such a promising biomarker for cancer, because as you know, cancer is a disease of altered gene expression.
It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes.
Another important thing to consider is that no two cancers are the same, but at the microRNA level, there are patterns.
So imagine trying to differentiate two molecules, extremely similar, extremely small.
We believe that we have found a way to do so, and this is the first time that we've shown it in public.
Let me do a demonstration.
Each well of these plates has specific biochemistry that we assign, that is looking for a specific microRNA, acting like a trap that closes only when the microRNA is present in the sample, and when it does, it will shine with green color.
To run the reaction, you put the plate inside a device like this one, and then you can put your smartphone on top of it.
If we can have a camera here so you can see my screen.

If we can have a camera here so you can see my screen.
A smartphone is a connected computer and it's also a camera, good enough for our purpose.
It is too expensive for our families.
It is too expensive for humanity.
We cannot lose the war against cancer.
Today, my aunt, she's fighting bravely and going through this process with a very positive attitude.
However, I want fights like this to become very rare.
I want to see the day when cancer is treated easily because it can be routinely diagnosed at the very early stages, and I'm certain that in the very near future, because of this and other breakthroughs that we are seeing every day in the life sciences, the way we see cancer will radically change.


Technology has brought us so much: the moon landing, the Internet, the ability to sequence the human genome.
language is created by people, and people are messy and we're complex and we use metaphors and slang and jargon and we do this 24/7 in many, many languages, and then as soon as we figure it out, we change it up.
So did these ads that the CDC put on, these television ads that featured a woman with a hole in her throat and that were very graphic and very disturbing, did they actually have an impact on whether people quit?
And the Health Media Collaboratory respected the limits of their data, but they were able to conclude that those advertisements — and you may have seen them — into a thought process that may have an impact on future behavior.
I want to tell you a personal story about why this matters a lot to me.
I need to take a breath.
My son Isaac, when he was two, was diagnosed with autism, and he was this happy, hilarious, loving, affectionate little guy, but the metrics on his developmental evaluations, which looked at things like the number of words — at that point, none — communicative gestures and minimal eye contact, put his developmental level at that of a nine-month-old baby.
Because at this point in our history, as we've heard many times over, we can process exabytes of data at lightning speed, and we have the potential to make bad decisions far more quickly, efficiently, and with far greater impact than we did in the past.
Great, right?
And so what we need to do instead is spend a little bit more time on things like the humanities and sociology, and the social sciences, rhetoric, philosophy, ethics, because they give us context that is so important for big data, and because they help us become better critical thinkers.
I graduated from high school in Zimbabwe and I went off to college.
Six years later, I returned to the country.
Everything was different.
The central bank governor will think you're crazy.
You might get impeached for that.
But if you become the president of Zimbabwe, and you say, "You know, I really like this job.
Now, I hope you will agree with me that these things I've just described to you, each of them, deserves some kind of prize.  And that's what they got, each of them got an Ig Nobel prize.
In 1991, I, together with bunch of other people, started the Ig Nobel prize ceremony.
Every year we give out 10 prizes.
Years later, she moved to America.
She had a baby, One day she looked, and on the floor, her infant son had picked up her bra, and had her bra on his face.
And that's where the idea came from.

We need to build a log cabin, if you will, at the bottom of the sea.
And so there was a great curiosity in my soul when I went to go visit a TED [Prize winner] by the name of Dr. Sylvia Earle.
Maybe you've heard of her.

Because of the luxury of time, we were able to study animals such as sharks and grouper in aggregations that we've never seen before.
It's like seeing dogs and cats behaving well together.
Even being able to commune with animals that are much larger than us, such as this endangered goliath grouper who only still resides in the Florida Keys.
And that particular camera gives us an insight into what fairly common animals do but we can't even see it in the blink of an eye.
Let me show you a quick video of what this camera does.
You can see the silky bubble come out of our hard hats.
You can see the silky bubble come out of our hard hats.
It gives us an insight into some of the animals that we were sitting right next to for 31 days and never normally would have paid attention to, such as hermit crabs.
Now, using a cutting-edge piece of technology that's not really meant for the oceans is not always easy.
But before I do that, I want to tell you a bit about where it came from, what motivated it.
So I was born in Russia, and three years ago, in 2011, there were the Russian federal elections.
There were massive irregularities reported, and people came out to protest, which was very unlikely for Russia.
But there are a few hurdles, and they are quite basic and quite fundamental.
One is piloting.
So for this image, they flew a camera, a five kilogram device with an SLR under it.
And this is one potential solution.
So this is the Fotokite.
Well, let me see, it's a quadrocopter, but what's kind of special about it is there's a leash.
So this is the Fotokite.

Live demos are hard, right?
Things go wrong all the time.
But no matter what, this thing will actually prevent this thing from going into you.

What's more, it tells you immediately that I am the one responsible for this device.
And in 2005, I was working at a big cancer center when I received the news that my mother had breast cancer.
And then five days later, I received the news that I had breast cancer.
My mother and I can be competitive —  — but I was really not trying to compete with her on this one.
He's pretty aware of cancer already.
It was at that point where I felt like, oh my God, this is just taking over my life.
And that's when I told myself, claim your experience.
And he did.
He started volunteering and he made friends there, and he began going to a church and he made friends there, and at Christmas he invited my husband and me to a party in his apartment, and the place was filled with his friends.
Claim your experience.
Survivor.
No movement, no growth.
Claim your experience.
And I believe that for us, being in the tomb means doing our own deep inner work around our wounds and allowing ourselves to be healed.
We have to let that crucified self die so that a new self, a truer self, is born.
We have to let that old story go so that a new story, a truer story, can be told.
We have to let that crucified self die so that a new self, a truer self, is born.

Well, we got 331, which is okay, but we also know that not a lot of guerrillas saw them, but we know that a lot of guerrillas heard about them, and we know this because we are constantly talking to demobilized guerrillas.
So let me take you back four years before the trees.
Four years before the trees, we were approached by the government to help them come up with a communications strategy to get as many guerrillas as we could out of the jungle.
Four years before the trees, we were approached by the government to help them come up with a communications strategy to get as many guerrillas as we could out of the jungle.
The government had a military strategy, it had a political strategy, but it said, "We don't really have a communications strategy, and it probably would be a good thing to have," so we decided to immediately jump into this, because it is an opportunity to affect the outcome of the conflict with the things that we do, with the tools that we have.
But we didn't know very much about it.
They did meet.
She had been recruited when she was 15, and she left when she was 17, so there were a lot of other complications, but they did eventually meet.
I don't know if they're together now, but I can find out.  But what I can tell you is that our radio strategy was working.

I don't know if they're together now, but I can find out.  But what I can tell you is that our radio strategy was working.
The problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla.
And we thought we had to do with public money the half that families won't be able to do individually.
We identified five design conditions that belonged to the hard half of a house, and we went back to the families to do two things: join forces and split tasks.
Our design was something in between a building and a house.
We wanted to have a working space with the right light, with the right temperature, with the right air.
So we asked ourselves: Does the typical office building help us in that sense?
Well, how does that building look, typically?
He himself is saying that.
Man 3: No, no, no, Nieves...
Alejandro Aravena: I don't know if you were able to read the subtitles, but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not a hippie, romantic, kind of thing.
And what they said was, look, fine to protect the city against future tsunamis, we really appreciate, but the next one is going to come in, what, 20 years?
But every single year, we have problems of flooding due to rain.
In addition, we are in the middle of the forest region of the country, and our public space sucks.
It's poor and it's scarce.
And the origin of the city, our identity, is not really connected to the buildings that fell, it is connected to the river, but the river cannot be accessed publicly, because its shores are privately owned.
So we thought that we had to produce a third alternative, and our approach was against geographical threats, have geographical answers.
So design's power of synthesis is trying to make a more efficient use of the scarcest resource in cities, which is not money but coordination.
By doing so, we were able to save four million dollars, and that is why the forest is today under construction.
So be it the force of self construction, the force of common sense, or the force of nature, all these forces need to be translated into form, and what that form is modeling and shaping is not cement, bricks, or wood.
People tend to think of prohibition as the ultimate form of regulation when in fact it represents the abdication of regulation with criminals filling the void.
Which is why putting criminal laws and police front and center in trying to control a dynamic global commodities market is a recipe for disaster.
And what we really need to do is to bring the underground drug markets as much as possible aboveground and regulate them as intelligently as we can to minimize both the harms of drugs and the harms of prohibitionist policies.
Now, with marijuana, that obviously means legally regulating and taxing it like alcohol.
The benefits of doing so are enormous, the risks minimal.
Will more people use marijuana?
Now, could we reduce smoking even more by making it totally illegal? Probably.
But just imagine the drug war nightmare that would result.
So the challenges we face today The first is the policy challenge of designing and implementing alternatives to ineffective prohibitionist policies, even as we need to get better at regulating and living with the drugs that are now legal.
Merci. We have to prepare for the following performance, and I have a question for you, and the question is this: You show up in places like the ones you just have shown us, and you are carrying a camera and I assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome.
You walk into sacred rituals, private moments in a village, a town, a group of people.
How do you break the barrier when you show up with a lens?
When did you do a video with him?
VM: I guess four years ago, four years in my first travel.
BG: So it was one of your first ones in Brazil.
The first patient to ever be treated with an antibiotic was a policeman in Oxford.
On his day off from work, he was scratched by a rose thorn while working in the garden.
That small scratch became infected.
So they gave Albert Alexander, this Oxford policeman, the drug, and within 24 hours, he started getting better.
His fever went down, his appetite came back.
Second day, he was doing much better.
And you can see in 1999 this is the pattern of resistance, mostly under about 10 percent across the United States.
Now watch what happens when we play the video.
So I don't know where you live, but wherever it is, it certainly is a lot worse now than it was in 1999, and that is the problem of antibiotic resistance.
A hospital in St. Louis basically would put up on a chart the names of surgeons in the ordering of how much antibiotics they'd used in the previous month, and this was purely an informational feedback, there was no shaming, but essentially that provided some information back to surgeons that maybe they could rethink how they were using antibiotics.
Now, there's a lot that can be done on the supply side as well.
If you look at the price of penicillin, the cost per day is about 10 cents.
And it was: We found out that she had stage IV breast cancer, cancer that by then had spread to her lungs, her bones, and her brain.
My mother was brave, though, and she had hope.
She went through surgery and radiation, and was on her third round of chemotherapy when she lost her address book.
No? I thought I heard a beep.  Sound familiar?
Yeah, it sounds familiar to me, too.
A couple of weeks after I put that online, 500,000 people in dozens of countries, I mean dozens of countries, watched this video.
A common theme running through all of these comments online is this fundamental belief that we are powerless to do anything other than go to meetings and suffer through these poorly run meetings and live to meet another day.
But the truth is, we're not powerless at all.
In fact, the cure for MAS is right here in our hands.
It's right at our fingertips, literally.
It's something that I call ¡No MAS!
Which, if I remember my high school Spanish, means something like, "Enough already, make it stop!"
Now, this bleed is extremely traumatic and can kill you in less than three minutes.
Unfortunately, by the time that a medic actually gets to you, can take five minutes or more, with the application of pressure, to stop that type of bleed.
Now, this problem is not only a huge problem for the military, but it's also a huge problem that's epidemic throughout the entire medical field, which is how do we actually look at wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body?
But not many people know what else.
But it actually turns out that your cells sit in this mesh of complicated fibers, proteins and sugars known as the extracellular matrix.
So now, the ECM is actually this mesh that holds the cells in place, provides structure for your tissues, but it also gives the cells a home.
So now every other piece of technology on the market can only manage a two- dimensional approximation of the extracellular matrix, which means that it doesn't fit in with the tissue itself.
So when I was a freshman at NYU, what I discovered was you could actually take small pieces of plant-derived polymers and reassemble them onto the wound.
So if you have a bleeding wound like the one behind me, you can actually put our material onto this, and just like Lego blocks, it'll reassemble into the local tissue.

So now, this has a whole bunch of applications, but basically the idea is, wherever you put this product, you're able to reassemble into it immediately.
Now, this is a simulated arterial bleed — at twice human artery pressure.
So now, this type of bleed is incredibly traumatic, and like I said before, would actually take five minutes or more with pressure to be able to stop.
So now, this type of bleed is incredibly traumatic, and like I said before, would actually take five minutes or more with pressure to be able to stop.
Now, in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself, our material is able to stop that bleed, and it's because it actually goes on and works with the body to heal, so it reassembles into this piece of meat, and then the blood actually recognizes that that's happening, and produces fibrin, producing a very fast clot in less than 10 seconds.
So now this technology — Thank you.
Several months later, I was in the northeast Amazon, walked into a village, and the shaman said, "You're limping."
And I'll never forget this as long as I live.
He looked me in the face and he said, "Take off your shoe and give me your machete."
He looked me in the face and he said, "Take off your shoe and give me your machete."
He walked over to a palm tree and carved off a fern, threw it in the fire, applied it to my foot, threw it in a pot of water, and had me drink the tea.
The pain disappeared for seven months.
This is not an acceptable way of doing business.
The rainforest has been called the greatest expression of life on Earth.
There's a saying in Suriname that I dearly love: "The rainforests hold answers to questions we have yet to ask."
The line through the middle is the eastern border of the reserve.
Top half Indians, bottom half white guys.
Top half wonder drugs, bottom half just a bunch of skinny-ass cows.
There's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes.
We see illegal logging coming from the south, and drug runners are trying to move through the park and get into Brazil.
This, in the past, is why you didn't mess with isolated Indians.
They were shot at, their malocas, their longhouses, were burned.
Some of them were massacred.
Using automatic weapons to slaughter uncontacted peoples is the single most despicable and disgusting human rights abuse on our planet today, and it has to stop.
I became interested in the way they were choosing to represent themselves, this outward expression of masculinity, the ideal of the warrior.
I worked slowly, using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter.
The process is old-fashioned.
We pass Mjølfjell Station.

I have some really strong memories from that week, and it's all about people.
This guy, for instance, he's head of research at the University in Tromsø  And I will show you a piece of cloth, this one.
It's the other strong memory.
This guy, for instance, he's head of research at the University in Tromsø  And I will show you a piece of cloth, this one.
It's the other strong memory.
It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen.
He came at 9 a.m., and he didn't get a note from his teacher, because the teacher had watched the program.
How did we do this?
Yes, we took a conference room on board the Hurtigruten.
Cameraman: I work on different camera solutions.
They're just tools used in a different context.
TH: Another camera is this one. It's normally used for sports.
Even the passengers on board the Hurtigruten coastal ship --  -- they chose to watched the telly instead of turning 90 degrees and watching out the window.
So we were allowed to be part of people's living room with this strange TV program, with music, nature, people.
And Slow TV was now a buzzword, and we started looking for other things we could make Slow TV about.
We didn't know anything more when we left Bergen.
So you have to let the viewers make the stories themselves, and I'll give you an example of that.
This is from last summer, and as a TV producer, it's a nice picture, but now you can cut to the next one.

Some of you start wondering, is the farmer at home?
Has he left? Is he watching the cow?
And where is that cow going?
So my point is, the longer you keep a picture like this, and we kept it for 10 minutes, you start making the stories in your own head.
That's Slow TV.
So we think that Slow TV is one nice way of telling a TV story, and we think that we can continue doing it, not too often, once or twice a year, so we keep the feeling of an event, and we also think that the good Slow TV idea, that's the idea when people say, "Oh no, you can't put that on TV."
And if you drive a car in the United States, I would bet money that they have photographs like this of you going about your daily life.
Mike hasn't done anything wrong.
Why is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information?
Also, using a device known as a StingRay, law enforcement agents can send tracking signals inside people's houses to identify the cell phones located there.
And if they don't know which house to target, they've been known to drive this technology around through whole neighborhoods.
Just as the police in Ferguson possess high-tech military weapons and equipment, so too do police departments across the United States possess high-tech surveillance gear.

So you can see, though, that the tensions that we've heard about in San Francisco in terms of people being concerned about gentrification and all the new tech companies that are bringing new wealth and settlement into the city are real, and you can actually see that documented here.
You can see the LGBT community is not really getting along with the geek community that well, the arts community, the music community.
And so it leads to things like this.
Even something as mysterious as love.
And so, to try to persuade you of how totally amazing, excellent and relevant mathematics is, I want to give you my top three mathematically verifiable tips for love.
Okay, so Top Tip #1: How to win at online dating.
Before, effort and difficulty made them feel dumb, made them feel like giving up, but now, effort and difficulty, that's when their neurons are making new connections, stronger connections.
That's when they're getting smarter.
I received a letter recently from a 13-year-old boy.
Audience: Wugs.
Erin McKean: Exactly! You know how to make the plural of wug.
That rule lives in your brain.
"Commercial" used to be an adjective and now it's a noun.
And of course, you can "green" things.
Another way to make words in English is back-formation.
And therefore, I decided to dedicate my life to bringing down the walls that separate people.
I do so through many ways.
Tourism is one of them, but also media and education, and you might be wondering, really, can tourism change things?
By the way, this is my mother. She's cool.
And that's the Palestinian food called maqluba.
It means "upside-down."

I lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge.
I bought a racing bicycle that summer, and I bicycled every day to work.
To find my way, I used my phone.
All of us; all of us equally.
And so you feel that at least in a small way you're repairing that huge social fracture which makes it so that for many of them, prison is their only destination.
I remember a verse by a tremendous poet, a great poet, from our Unit 48 workshop, Nicolás Dorado: "I will need an infinite thread to sew up this huge wound."
And so you feel that at least in a small way you're repairing that huge social fracture which makes it so that for many of them, prison is their only destination.
I remember a verse by a tremendous poet, a great poet, from our Unit 48 workshop, Nicolás Dorado: "I will need an infinite thread to sew up this huge wound."
Poetry does that; it sews up the wounds of exclusion.
They have to get into their heads, search for that bit of freedom that can never be taken away when they write and that is also useful to realize that freedom is possible even inside a prison, and that the only bars we have in our wonderful space is the word "bars," and that all of us in our hell burn with happiness when we light the wick of the word.
I told you a lot about the prison, a lot about what I experience every week, and how I enjoy it and transform myself with the inmates.
But you don't know how much I'd like it if you could feel, live, experience, even for a few seconds, what I enjoy every week and what makes me who I am.
And that DNA is what we're going to compare to the DNA that comes from the skeletons.
While we're doing that, though, we're looking for the bodies.
And these are skeletons by now, most of these crimes happened 32 years ago.
You will not play at the casino that you bring some kind of well-being within society, in education, at the workplace.
Otherwise, a nation that is the most powerful and the richest but everyone is miserable, what's the point?
And if you have more consideration for others, you are not going to ransack that planet that we have and at the current rate, we don't have three planets to continue that way.
It can be extended even to other species.
Now, if we want a more altruistic society, we need two things: individual change and societal change.
So is individual change possible?
So I'll start with mobility.
Insects move around amazingly well.
This video is from UC Berkeley.
This is actuated with a method that we call in my lab "graduate student with tweezers."  So what you'll see in the next video is this guy doing amazingly well for its jumps.
So this is Aaron, the graduate student in question, with the tweezers, and what you see is this four-millimeter-sized mechanism jumping almost 40 centimeters high.
That's almost 100 times its own length.

We want sensing, power, control, actuation all together, and not everything needs to be bio-inspired.
So this robot's about the size of a Tic Tac.
And in this case, instead of magnets or muscles to move this around, we use rockets.
So this is a micro-fabricated energetic material, and we can create tiny pixels of this, and we can put one of these pixels on the belly of this robot, and this robot, then, is going to jump when it senses an increase in light.
So the next video is one of my favorites.
So you have this 300-milligram robot jumping about eight centimeters in the air.
And that kick crowned, basically, 30 years of basic research studying how the brain, how this amazing universe that we have between our ears that is only comparable to universe that we have above our head because it has about 100 billion elements talking to each other through electrical brainstorms, what Juliano accomplished took 30 years to imagine in laboratories and about 15 years to plan.
When John Chapin and I, 15 years ago, proposed in a paper that we would build something that we called a brain-machine interface, meaning connecting a brain to devices so that animals and humans could just move these devices, no matter how far they are from their own bodies, just by imagining what they want to do, our colleagues told us that we actually needed professional help, of the psychiatry variety.
And despite that, a Scot and a Brazilian persevered, because that's how we were raised in our respective countries, and for 12, 15 years, we made demonstration after demonstration suggesting that this was possible.
By sensorizing these devices with lots of different types of sensors, as you are going to see in a moment, we actually sent messages back to the brain to confirm that that voluntary motor will was being enacted, no matter where -- next to the subject, next door, or across the planet.
And as this message gave feedback back to the brain, the brain realized its goal: to make us move.
So this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago, where a monkey, without moving its body, learned to control the movements of an avatar arm, a virtual arm that doesn't exist.
The perfect Brazilian lunch: not moving a muscle and getting your orange juice.
So as we saw this happening, we actually came and proposed the idea that we had published 15 years ago.
We reenacted this paper.
And more than that --  -- more than just walking, he is feeling the ground, and if the speed of the exo goes up, he tells us that he is walking again on the sand of Santos, the beach resort where he used to go before he had the accident.
That's why the brain is creating a new sensation in Bruno's head.
So he walks, and at the end of the walk -- I am running out of time already -- he says, "You know, guys, I need to borrow this thing from you when I get married, because I wanted to walk to the priest and see my bride and actually be there by myself.
And this is what we wanted to show during the World Cup, and couldn't, because for some mysterious reason, FIFA cut its broadcast in half.
What you are going to see very quickly is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick a few minutes before we went to the pitch and did the real thing in front of the entire crowd, and the lights you are going to see just describe the operation.
Basically, the blue lights pulsating indicate that the exo is ready to go.
Bruno Giussani: Miguel, thank you for sticking to your time.
I actually would have given you a couple more minutes, because there are a couple of points we want to develop, and, of course, clearly it seems that we need connected brains to figure out where this is going.
So let's connect all this together.
But each monkey is only getting the two dimensions on the video screen that the monkey controls.
And to get that thing done, you need at least two monkeys to synchronize their brains, but the ideal is three.
So what we found out is that when one monkey starts slacking down, the other two monkeys enhance their performance to get the guy to come back, so this adjusts dynamically, but the global synchrony remains the same.


It is very fashionable and proper to speak about food in all its forms, all its colors, aromas and tastes.
And when both are ready, they build a toilet, a shower room, and of course also a water tower, an elevated water reservoir.
We use a system of two leach pits to treat the waste.
From the toilet, the muck comes into the first leach pit.
If any of you come to my place, I would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you.
So there you can see the completed toilets, the water towers.
This is in a village where most of the people are even illiterate.

I want to speak about a forgotten conflict.
It's a conflict that rarely hits the headlines.
It happens right here, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Now, most people outside of Africa don't know much about the war in Congo, so let me give you a couple of key facts.
The Congolese conflict is the deadliest conflict since World War II.
Now, most people outside of Africa don't know much about the war in Congo, so let me give you a couple of key facts.
The Congolese conflict is the deadliest conflict since World War II.
It has caused almost four million deaths.
Well, the reason why militias had attacked Isabelle's village was because they wanted to take the land that the villagers needed to cultivate food and to survive.
The second central observation is that international peace efforts have failed to help address local conflicts because of the presence of a dominant peacebuilding culture.
So what I mean is that Western and African diplomats, United Nations peacekeepers, donors, the staff of most nongovernmental organizations that work with the resolution of conflict, they all share a specific way of seeing the world.
Maybe we could listen to a nice bit of Mozart.
Have you heard of the idea of the Mozart effect?
So the idea is that listening to Mozart makes you smarter and improves your performance on I.Q. tests.
In every culture, too, men preferred women who were younger than themselves, an average of, I think it was 2.66 years, and in every culture, too, women preferred men who were older than them, so an average of 3.42 years, which is why we've got here "Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy."
So moving on from trying to score with a partner to trying to score in basketball or football or whatever your sport is.
The myth here is that sportsmen go through hot-hand streaks, Americans call them, or purple patches, we sometimes say in England, where they just can't miss, like this guy here.
Lastly, I had to code a smartphone app that would essentially transform the care-giver's smartphone into a remote monitor.
For this, I had to expand upon my knowledge of coding with Java and XCode and I also had to learn about how to code for Bluetooth low energy devices by watching YouTube tutorials and reading various textbooks.
Integrating these components, I was able to successfully create two prototypes, one in which the sensor is embedded inside a sock, and another that's a re-attachable sensor assembly that can be adhered anywhere that makes contact with the bottom of the patient's foot.
He was right. Why didn't I call him?
I didn't have an answer then, but I do today, and it's a simple one: loneliness.
Loneliness creates a deep psychological wound, one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking.
It depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected from those around you.
And I did.
There is a lot of research on loneliness, and all of it is horrifying.
I'm not kidding.
Chronic loneliness increases your likelihood of an early death by 14 percent.
Loneliness causes high blood pressure, high cholesterol.
I once visited a day care center, where I saw three toddlers play with identical plastic toys.
You had to slide the red button, and a cute doggie would pop out.
One little girl tried pulling the purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back and looked at the box, with her lower lip trembling.
But you cannot allow yourself to become convinced you can't succeed.
You have to fight feelings of helplessness.
You have to gain control over the situation.
We all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings, what we wish we were, what we wish we weren't, we call ourselves names.
Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it.
And it's interesting that we do, because our self-esteem is already hurting.
Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene.
Because we don't prioritize our psychological health.
We know from dozens of studies that when your self-esteem is lower, you are more vulnerable to stress and to anxiety, that failures and rejections hurt more and it takes longer to recover from them.
But achieving a dream is a momentary sensation, and your life is not.
The only way to really achieve all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step of your journey.
That's the best way.

We humans have always been very concerned about the health of our bodies, but we haven't always been that good at figuring out what's important.
Take the ancient Egyptians, for example: very concerned about the body parts they thought they'd need in the afterlife, but they left some parts out. This part, for example.
This buzzing is a cicada.
This is a family of gibbons.
It's actually singing to each other over a great distance.
People in my generation have heard about saving the rainforest since we were kids, and it seems that the message has never changed: We've got to save the rainforest, it's super urgent, this many football fields have been destroyed yesterday.
and yet here we are today, about half of the rainforest remains, and we have potentially more urgent problems like climate change.
But in fact, this is the little-known fact that I didn't realize at the time: Deforestation accounts for more greenhouse gas than all of the world's planes, trains, cars, trucks and ships combined.
It might just be the cheapest, fastest way to fight climate change.
And so here's the system that we imagine.
It looks super high tech.
That was not exceptional, we were told, and that particularly is on the periphery of the forests that are most under threat.
And then something really amazing happened, which was that people started sending us their own old cell phones.
So in fact what we have now is a system where we can use people on the ground, people who are already there, who can both improve and use the existing connectivity, and we're using old cell phones that are being sent to us by people from around the world that want their phones to be doing something else in their afterlife, And if the rest of the device can be completely recycled,
Before the invention of email, we largely communicated using letters, and the process was quite simple.
You would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper, then you would place it into a sealed envelope, after you put a stamp and address on it.
Unfortunately, today, when we actually send an email, we're not sending a letter.

They need to know where we live, how old we are, what we like, what we don't like, and anything else they can get their hands on.
And if you think about it, the best way to get this information is really just to invade our privacy.
So these companies aren't going to give us our privacy.
So what we do is we generate encryption keys on your computer, and we don't generate a single key, but actually a pair of keys, so there's an RSA private key and an RSA public key, and these keys are mathematically connected.
So let's have a look and see how this works when multiple people communicate.
So here we have Bob and Alice, who want to communicate privately.
So let's have a look and see how this works when multiple people communicate.
So here we have Bob and Alice, who want to communicate privately.
So the key challenge is to take Bob's message and to get it to Alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message.

So the key challenge is to take Bob's message and to get it to Alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message.
So we've now accomplished the objective, which is to get the message from Bob to Alice without the server being able to read what's going on.
Actually, what I've shown here is a highly simplified picture.
The reality is much more complex and it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this.
Now, during all this time, he was holding a small notebook that sometimes he would open and flip through the pages and look at something.
But I was not really paying attention to the book because I was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before, "I will not touch the deck till the end."
Now sir, you have the giraffe.
I really do.
And the reason why we don't see them as often, it's because we don't place ourselves in a position to search for those amazing things.
But what if we decided to search for those amazing things, for those small coincidences in life that are truly amazing?
Audience member 3: I think so.
HG: Yes? You see, a coincidence!
Let's make sure you have it.
I have a dollar bill here to explain.
I want you to take the dollar bill, and fold the Washington part inside, like this.
So you get this kind of big square, okay?
And this is the reason why: later, I'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage and I don't want you to think, oh, while I was distracted by Helder, someone came onstage and swapped the bill.
So I want to make sure it's exactly the same bill.
Now not only that, I want you to take the paper clip and put it around the bill.
We could combine a toothbrush with a guitar and --  -- you've got a toy you can play with while brushing your teeth.
Kids who don't like to brush their teeth might begin to like it.
Can we make a hat into a toy?
I study maths. I write poetry.
So I thought I'd start with a love poem about prime numbers.
This is called "59."
Shadows were nowhere to be seen; when she was there he beamed, His eyes would light up in ways that can’t be faked, When she grinned her rays erased the razor-tipped words of hate, They gave each other nicknames, they were "cool star" and "fun sun," And gradually the shadowy damage became undone, She was one in a septillion, and she was brilliant, Could turn the coldest blooded reptilians vermillion, Loved by billions, from Chileans to Brazilians,
And taught the Sunshine Kid the meaning of resilience.
She said: “All the darkness in the world cannot put out the light from a single candle So how the hell can they handle your light?
This is L'Ospedale degli Innocenti, built in 1419 by Brunelleschi, who was one of the most famous and influential architects of his time.
And when I look at this building and then think about hospitals today, what amazes me is this building's ambition.
It's just a really great building.
And when I look at this building and then think about hospitals today, what amazes me is this building's ambition.
It's just a really great building.
It has these courtyards in the middle so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air, and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings, so they just feel more comfortable to be in.
Recording these interviews, I saw how the microphone gave me the license to go places I otherwise never would have gone and talk to people I might not otherwise ever have spoken to.
I had the privilege of getting to know some of the most amazing, fierce and courageous human beings I had ever met.
It was the first time the story of Stonewall had been told to a national audience.
They usually have obsessions.
In Josh's case, it's with animals, so this is Josh talking with his mom Sarah at Grand Central nine years ago.
Josh Littman: From a scale of one to 10, do you think your life would be different without animals?
My generation of women fought the battles for the right to work and the right for equal pay.
Nobody really expected much from people at work or in society because all the expectations then were about home and family responsibilities.
And I couldn't really face that, so I started to challenge the conventions of the time, even to the extent of changing my name from "Stephanie" to "Steve" so as to get through the door before anyone realized that he was a she.
In 1975, 13 years from startup, equal opportunity legislation came in in Britain and that made it illegal to have our pro-female policies.
And as an example of unintended consequences, my female company had to let the men in.
When I started my company of women, the men said, "How interesting, because it only works because it's small."
Let me share with you two secrets of success: Surround yourself with first-class people and people that you like; and choose your partner very, very carefully.
Because the other day when I said, "My husband's an angel," a woman complained -- "You're lucky," she said, "mine's still alive."
If success were easy, we'd all be millionaires.
I need never worry about getting lost because several charities would quickly come and find me.
It's one thing to have an idea for an enterprise, but as many people in this room will know, making it happen is a very difficult thing and it demands extraordinary energy, self-belief and determination, the courage to risk family and home, and a 24/7 commitment that borders on the obsessive.
So it's just as well that I'm a workaholic.
["No dogs and Chinese allowed"] How would you feel if you were Chinese, in your own country, if you saw that sign appear?
China also believes and feels as if, in the events of 1919, at the Peace Conference in Paris, when Germany's colonies were given back to all sorts of countries around in the world, what about German colonies in China? They were, in fact, given to Japan.
When Japan then invaded China in the 1930s the world looked away and was indifferent to what would happen to China.
On the question of is the U.S. containing China, they say, "No, look at the history of the Soviet Union. That was containment."
Instead, what we have done in the U.S. and the West is welcome China into the global economy, and on top of that, welcome them into the World Trade Organization.
The U.S. and the West say China cheats on the question of intellectual property rights, and through cyberattacks on U.S. and global firms.
And you see this teenager running down a street, and then you see Google Street View and Google Maps imagery and you realize the street he's running down is yours.
And when he stops in front of a house, he stops in front of your house.
And this was great, and I saw people having an even deeper emotional reaction to this than the things that I had made in rectangles.
How do we even figure this out?
to look at what we really want, we thought about the philosopher John Rawls.
If you remember John Rawls, he had this notion of what's a just society.
My contacts worked to expedite my case through UNHCR, and I got resettled in Australia in May 2013.
Not every asylum seeker is lucky like me.
It is really difficult to live a life with an uncertain fate, in limbo.
But in this kindergarten, there is no reason they get nervous.
Because there is no boundary.
And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn't want to stay in the room, we let him go.
I just cared about the laughter, and actually, as a neuroscientist, I've come to care about it again.
And it is a really weird thing to do.
What I'm going to do now is just play some examples of real human beings laughing, and in fact how primitive laughter is as a sound.
So it's not at all unusual, for example, to hear people to say humans are the only animals that laugh.
Nietzsche thought that humans are the only animals that laugh.
In fact, you find laughter throughout the mammals.
In fact, you find laughter throughout the mammals.
It's been well-described and well-observed in primates, but you also see it in rats, and wherever you find it -- humans, primates, rats -- you find it associated with things like tickling.
That's the same for humans.
It's been well-described and well-observed in primates, but you also see it in rats, and wherever you find it -- humans, primates, rats -- you find it associated with things like tickling.
That's the same for humans.
You find it associated with play, and all mammals play.
The thing I really like about that is it's all very serious until he jumps onto the ice, and as soon as he doesn't go through the ice, but also there isn't blood and bone everywhere, his friends start laughing.
And imagine if that had played him out with him standing there going, "No seriously, Heinrich, I think this is broken," we wouldn't enjoy watching that. That would be stressful.
Or if he was running around with a visibly broken leg laughing, and his friends are going, "Heinrich, I think we need to go to the hospital now," that also wouldn't be funny.
But notice the violence that they fear is not the violence of genocide or the wars, it's everyday violence.
So for me, as a lawyer, of course, my first reaction was to think, well, of course we've got to change all the laws.
We've got to make all this violence against the poor illegal.
Now I want you to relax your hand.
Sam, you're with me?
So you're going to squeeze.

You may not realize this, but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy.
This fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us is an integral part of our health, and our technology is evolving so rapidly that today we can program these bacteria like we program computers.
Now, what you can't see is that our genetic program instructs these bacteria to each produce small molecules, and these molecules travel between the thousands of individual bacteria telling them when to turn on and off.
And the bacteria synchronize quite well at this scale, but because the molecule that synchronizes them together can only travel so fast, in larger colonies of bacteria, this results in traveling waves between bacteria that are far away from each other, and you can see these waves going from right to left across the screen.
Now, our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon called quorum sensing, in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors once they reach a critical density.
Now, our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon called quorum sensing, in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors once they reach a critical density.
You can observe quorum sensing in action in this movie, where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow once it reaches a high or critical density.
Our genetic program continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins as the colony grows outwards.
The last one was a pitchpole.
I have the Argus beacon with me.
I would set off the distress signal, but quite frankly, I don't think they'd ever be able to find this little boat.
She was having a hard time making the transition back into civilization.
In this scene, she sits at home.
The phone is ringing, her friends are calling, but she doesn't know how to talk to them.
This is Bret Adee opening one of his 72,000 beehives.
He and his brother run the largest beekeeping operation in the world, and the USDA is integrating their mite-resistant bees into his operation with the hope that over time, they'll be able to select the bees that are not only mite-resistant but also retain all of these qualities that make them useful to us.
And to say it like that makes it sound like we're manipulating and exploiting bees, and the truth is, we've been doing that for thousands of years.
And then she actually built it.
I don't think I realized this was so unusual at the time, and maybe I still haven't, because I'm still designing houses.
This is a six-story bespoke home on the island of Bali.
First, we needed safe treatment solutions.
Borax is a natural salt.
It turns bamboo into a viable building material.
Why are doors so often rectangular?
Why not round?
How could you make a door better?
To reap the selective benefits and work within the constraints of this material, we have really had to push ourselves, and within that constraint, we have found space for something new.
It's a challenge: how do you make a ceiling if you don't have any flat boards to work with?
Let me tell you, sometimes I dream of sheet rock and plywood.
And few things give me greater joy than a well-designed flag.
Yeah!
Happy 50th anniversary on your flag, Canada.
Ted Kaye: Vexillology is the study of flags.
RM: It's that extra "lol" that makes it sound weird.
Narrator: Number one, keep it simple.
Narrator: Number three, use two to three basic colors.
TK: The basic rule for colors is to use two to three colors from the standard color set: red, white, blue, green, yellow and black.
RM: The design of the Chicago flag has complete buy-in with an entire cross-section of the city.
RM: And it isn't just that people love Chicago and therefore love the flag.
I also think that people love Chicago more because the flag is so cool.
TK: A positive feedback loop there between great symbolism and civic pride.

RM: Okay. So when I moved back to San Francisco in 2008, I researched its flag, because I had never seen it in the previous eight years I lived there.
The main component of the San Francisco flag is a phoenix representing the city rising from the ashes after the devastating fires of the 1850s.
TK: A powerful symbol for San Francisco.
RM: I still don't really dig the phoenix.
Now, if this were a United States city, the flag would probably look like this.
You know, yeah.  But instead, the flag of Amsterdam looks like this.
Rather than plopping the whole coat of arms on a solid background and writing "Amsterdam" below it, they just take the key elements of the escutcheon, the shield, and they turn it into the most badass city flag in the world.
RM: Meanwhile, back in San Francisco.
Is there anything we can do?
TK: I like to say that in every bad flag there's a good flag trying to get out.  The way to make San Francisco's flag a good flag is to take the motto off because you can't read that at a distance.

Take the name off, and the border might even be made thicker, so it's more a part of the flag.
Both are so much better.
And I think if they were adopted, I would see them around the city.
In my crusade to make flags of the world more beautiful, many listeners have taken it upon themselves to redesign their flags and look into the feasibility of getting them officially adopted.

If you see your city flag and like it, fly it, even if it violates a design rule or two.
I don't care.


I'd like to have you look at this pencil.
because if James Somerset was a legal thing, he was not eligible for a writ of habeus corpus, only if he could be a legal person.
So Lord Mansfield decided that he would assume, without deciding, that James Somerset was indeed a legal person, and he issued the writ of habeus corpus, and James's body was brought in by the captain of the ship.
There were a series of hearings over the next six months.
It was the coldest I've ever been.
But even with swollen lips, sunken eyes, and cheeks flushed red, I have found that this place right here is somewhere I can find great joy.
Now, when it comes to pain, psychologist Brock Bastian probably said it best when he wrote, "Pain is a kind of shortcut to mindfulness.

When I was growing up, I really liked playing hide-and-seek a lot.
One time, though, I thought climbing a tree would lead to a great hiding spot, but I fell and broke my arm.
I actually started first grade with a big cast all over my torso.
If my mom or I had a tool like this when we needed physical therapy, then we would have been more successful following the treatment, and perhaps gotten better a lot sooner.
Thank you.
Tom Rielly: So Cosmin, tell me what hardware is this that they're rapidly putting away?
We think the surface is hot enough to melt rock and has liquid lava lakes.
Gliese 1214b.
This planet, we know the mass and the size and it has a fairly low density.
So even though babies are going to see much less evidence for squeaking, and have many fewer actions to imitate in this one ball condition than in the condition you just saw, we predicted that babies themselves would squeeze more, and that's exactly what we found.
So 15-month-old babies, in this respect, like scientists, care whether evidence is randomly sampled or not, and they use this to develop expectations about the world: what squeaks and what doesn't, what to explore and what to ignore.
Let me show you another example now, this time about a problem of causal reasoning.
So in this next experiment, we're going to give babies just a tiny bit of statistical data supporting one hypothesis over the other, and we're going to see if babies can use that to make different decisions Here's the setup.
Hyowon is going to try to make the toy go and succeed.
I am then going to try twice and fail both times, and then Hyowon is going to try again and succeed, and this roughly sums up my relationship to my graduate students in technology across the board.
We rebuilt the entire school day schedule from scratch to add a variety of start and end times, remediation, honors courses, extracurricular activities, and counseling, all during the school day.
All during the school day.
We created a deployment plan that specified where every single support person and police officer would be every minute of the day, and we monitored at every second of the day, and, our best invention ever, we devised a schoolwide discipline program titled "Non-negotiables."
Naturally, I did not come out of the closet.
The kids at my school opened it without my permission.
Called me by a name I did not recognize, said "lesbian," but I was more boy than girl, more Ken than Barbie.

As she counts the echoes left behind by Mya Hall, Leelah Alcorn, Blake Brockington.
She fears that I'll die without a whisper, that I'll turn into "what a shame" conversations at the bus stop.
She claims I have turned myself into a mausoleum, that I am a walking casket, news headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle, Bruce Jenner on everyone's lips while the brutality of living in this body becomes an asterisk at the bottom of equality pages.
We've made the car stronger.
We've added seat belts, we've added air bags, and in the last decade, we've actually started trying to make the car smarter to fix that bug, the driver.
Now, today I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference between patching around the problem with driver assistance systems and actually having fully self-driving cars and what they can do for the world.

Now, today I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference between patching around the problem with driver assistance systems and actually having fully self-driving cars and what they can do for the world.
I'm also going to talk to you a little bit about our car and allow you to see how it sees the world and how it reacts and what it does, but first I'm going to talk a little bit about the problem.
And I'm going to start with some of our own experience.
So back in 2013, we had the first test of a self-driving car where we let regular people use it.
Well, almost regular -- they were 100 Googlers, but they weren't working on the project.
And we gave them the car and we allowed them to use it in their daily lives.
But unlike a real self-driving car, this one had a big asterisk with it: They had to pay attention, because this was an experimental vehicle.
We tested it a lot, but it could still fail.

We tested it a lot, but it could still fail.
And so we gave them two hours of training, we put them in the car, we let them use it, and what we heard back was something awesome, as someone trying to bring a product into the world.
And so we gave them two hours of training, we put them in the car, we let them use it, and what we heard back was something awesome, as someone trying to bring a product into the world.
Every one of them told us they loved it.
In fact, we had a Porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day, "This is completely stupid. What are we thinking?"
In fact, we had a Porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day, "This is completely stupid. What are we thinking?"
But at the end of it, he said, "Not only should I have it, everyone else should have it, because people are terrible drivers."
So this was music to our ears, but then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing, and this was eye-opening.

But at the end of it, he said, "Not only should I have it, everyone else should have it, because people are terrible drivers."
So this was music to our ears, but then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing, and this was eye-opening.
The better the technology gets, the less reliable the driver is going to get.
So by just making the cars incrementally smarter, we're probably not going to see the wins we really need.
Let me talk about something a little technical for a moment here.
You can ignore most of that axis, because if you're driving around town, and the car starts stopping randomly, you're never going to buy that car.
And the vertical axis is how often the car is going to apply the brakes when it's supposed to to help you avoid an accident.
Now, if we look at the bottom left corner here, this is your classic car.
We just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two.
There are now 17,000 less people dying every year in America.
But if we want a self-driving car, we need a technology curve that looks like this.
So there's a pretty big gap there.
And then finally, there's how the system can handle uncertainty.
So this pedestrian here might be stepping into the road, might not be.
So that's enough about the differences between the two.
Let's spend some time talking about how the car sees the world.
So this is our vehicle.
It starts by understanding where it is in the world, by taking a map and its sensor data and aligning the two, and then we layer on top of that what it sees in the moment.
So here, all the purple boxes you can see are other vehicles on the road, and the red thing on the side over there is a cyclist, and up in the distance, if you look really closely, you can see some cones.
Then we know where the car is in the moment, but we have to do better than that: we have to predict what's going to happen.

So here the pickup truck in top right is about to make a left lane change because the road in front of it is closed, so it needs to get out of the way.
Knowing that one pickup truck is great, but we really need to know what everybody's thinking, so it becomes quite a complicated problem.
So how hard can it really be?
Back when we started in 2009, this is what our system looked like.
So you can see our car in the middle and the other boxes on the road, driving down the highway.
His teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound, passed it to another teammate named Ray Allen.
He sank a three. It went into overtime.
They won the game. They won the championship.
Every day, I work to amplify the voices of women and to highlight their experiences and their participation in peace processes and conflict resolution, and because of my work, I recognize that the only way to ensure the full participation of women globally is by reclaiming religion.
Now, this matter is vitally important to me.
As a young Muslim woman, I am very proud of my faith.
Imagine you did that, right?
What would happen?
Now, we have a story about what would happen that we've been told for a century.

We think, because there are chemical hooks in heroin, as you took it for a while, your body would become dependent on those hooks, you'd start to physically need them, and at the end of those 20 days, you'd all be heroin addicts. Right?
That's what I thought.
Professor Alexander explained to me, the idea of addiction we've all got in our heads, that story, comes partly from a series of experiments that were done earlier in the 20th century.
They're really simple.
You can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic.
They've got loads of cheese, they've got loads of colored balls, Crucially, they've got loads of friends. They can have loads of sex.
And they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drugged water.
But here's the fascinating thing: In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water.
And they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drugged water.
But here's the fascinating thing: In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water.
They almost never use it.
It'll be 15 years this year since that experiment began, and the results are in: injecting drug use is down in Portugal, according to the British Journal of Criminology, by 50 percent, five-zero percent.
Overdose is massively down, HIV is massively down among addicts.
Addiction in every study is significantly down.
I actually think there's a layer of implications to all this research below that.
We live in a culture where people feel really increasingly vulnerable to all sorts of addictions, whether it's to their smartphones or to shopping or to eating.
Before these talks began -- you guys know this -- we were told we weren't allowed to have our smartphones on, and I have to say, a lot of you looked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable for the next couple of hours.  A lot of us feel like that, and it might sound weird to say, I've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction
AS: Now, the most beautiful thing to me --  -- as a photographer is the quality of vulnerability.
The physical exterior reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse at a more fragile interior.
At this date-a-thon event, I saw so many examples of that, but as I watched Stacey's dates and talked to her about them, I realized how different photographic love is from real love.
Okay, they would not be able to do that very often.
And indeed, neither can the katydids.
And so what that means is the katydid males are very choosy about who they offer these nuptial gifts to.
And indeed, neither can the katydids.
And so what that means is the katydid males are very choosy about who they offer these nuptial gifts to.
Now, the gift is very nutritious, and the female eats it during and after mating.
But they also are very used to having to deal with patients, so I'd say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you and that you become, literally, a patient -- "patient" means "the one who waits."
Things are changing, but classically, they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition, to get your friends and family engaged, or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you're going through.
But instead, you're forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers.

While I was in the hospital, I asked for a printed-out picture of my cancer and I spoke with it.
It was really hard to obtain, because it's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer.
So I created a website, which is called La Cura, on which I put my medical data, online.
I actually had to hack it and that's a thing which we can talk about in another speech.
I chose this word, La Cura -- La Cura in Italian means "the cure" -- because in many different cultures, the word "cure" can mean many different things.
I received lots of media attention from Italy and from abroad and I quickly received more than 500,000 contacts -- emails, social networking -- most of them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer, as a full individual.
For example, many thousands of videos, images, pictures, art performances were produced for La Cura.
For example, here we see Francesca Fini in her performance.
Writing messages is the essence of my artwork.
What is funny, actually, is that even Arabic-speaking people really need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing.
You don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece.

You don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece.
I think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes.
I was born and raised in France, in Paris, and I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was 18.
Today I only write messages in Arabic.
One of the reasons this is so important to me, is because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world.
But a week later, the organizer of the event asked me to come back, and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy's house.
So, this guy --  like, was forced to see it every day.
At the beginning, I was going to write, "[In Arabic]," which means, "In your face," but --  I decided to be smarter and I wrote, "[In Arabic]," which means, "Open your heart."
I'm really proud of my culture, and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork.
And I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know, with the beauty of Arabic script.
Today, I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall.

This is a map of New York State that was made in 1937 by the General Drafting Company.
It's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds, because down here at the bottom of the Catskill Mountains, there is a little town called Roscoe -- actually, this will go easier if I just put it up here -- There's Roscoe, and then right above Roscoe is Rockland, New York, and then right above that is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.
And I became a learner, because I found myself in a community of learners.
I found myself surrounded by people who celebrated intellectualism and engagement, and who thought that my ironic oh-so-cool disengagement wasn't clever, or funny, but, like, it was a simple and unspectacular response to very complicated and compelling problems.
And so I started to learn, because learning was cool.
But I think in a lot of ways, the YouTube page resembles a classroom.
Look for instance at "Minute Physics," a guy who's teaching the world about physics:  Let's cut to the chase.
As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally.
Good question. There are two main reasons.
First, just like the electron is an excitation in the electron field, the Higgs boson is simply a particle which is an excitation of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field.
The Higgs field in turn plays an integral role in our model for the weak nuclear force.
And you find this whether it's world history, or mathematics, or science, or whatever it is.
You also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the Internet in order to create places for intellectual engagement, instead of the ironic detachment that maybe most of us associate with memes and other Internet conventions -- you know, "Got bored. Invented calculus."
Or, here's Honey Boo Boo criticizing industrial capitalism: ["Liberal capitalism is not at all the Good of humanity.
The way he says "thank you" really creeps me out.
OK, so I'd like each of you to look under your chairs.
There's an envelope.
But what are states and nations?
They are not an objective reality.
A mountain is an objective reality.
And what do corporations do all day?
Mostly, they try to make money.
Yet, what is money?
Look at it -- it has no value.
You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it, you cannot wear it.
But then came along these master storytellers -- the big bankers, the finance ministers, the prime ministers -- and they tell us a very convincing story: "Look, you see this green piece of paper?
But, you give me a worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana?
No way!
What do you think I am, a human?
By the same token, in 2004, the surveillance system built into the network of Vodafone Greece -- Greece's largest telephone company -- was compromised by an unknown entity, and that feature, the surveillance feature, was used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister The foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught.
And really, this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features, or backdoors.
When you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology, you have no way of controlling who's going to go through it.
In other words: Are there processes, mechanisms, phenomena in living organisms that can only be explained with a helping hand from quantum mechanics?
Now, quantum biology isn't new; it's been around since the early 1930s.
But it's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments -- in biochemistry labs, using spectroscopy -- have shown very clear, firm evidence that there are certain specific mechanisms that require quantum mechanics to explain them.
It's a fuzzy world.
where particles can also behave like spread-out waves.
If we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics, then, as the fundamental foundation of reality itself, quantum physics underpins organic chemistry.
It's almost like magic.
Physicists and chemists have had nearly a century of trying to get used to this weirdness.
I don't blame the biologists for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics.
Erwin Schrödinger, of Schrödinger's Cat fame, He was one of the founders of quantum mechanics in the 1920s.
In 1944, he wrote a book called "What is Life?"
It was tremendously influential.
It's a wave that has a certain probability of being able to permeate through a solid wall, like a phantom leaping through to the other side.
You can see a faint smudge of light in the right-hand box.
Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier, and yet somehow, as though by magic, disappear from one side and reappear on the other.

Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier, and yet somehow, as though by magic, disappear from one side and reappear on the other.
The nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall, you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall.

Do they jump across, like the ball going over the wall?
Or can they quantum-tunnel across, even if they don't have enough energy?
Early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here.
Quantum coherence taking place inside a living cell.
A remarkable idea, and yet evidence is growing almost weekly, with new papers coming out, confirming that this does indeed take place.
My third and final example is the most beautiful, wonderful idea.

It's also still very speculative, but I have to share it with you.
The European robin migrates from Scandinavia down to the Mediterranean, every autumn, and like a lot of other marine animals and even insects, they navigate by sensing the Earth's magnetic field.
Now, the Earth's magnetic field is very, very weak; it's 100 times weaker than a fridge magnet, and yet it affects the chemistry -- somehow -- within a living organism.
That's not in doubt -- a German couple of ornithologists, Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko, in the 1970s, confirmed that indeed, the robin does find its way by somehow sensing the Earth's magnetic field, to give it directional information -- a built-in compass.
The puzzle, the mystery was: How does it do it?

Two quantum-entangled electrons within a single molecule dance a delicate dance that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies in the Earth's magnetic field.
We don't know if it's the correct explanation, but wow, wouldn't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate?
Quantum biology is still in it infancy.

Now, you can't get to these sites with a normal browser -- Chrome or Firefox -- because they're on this hidden part of the Internet, known as Tor hidden services, where URLs are a string of meaningless numbers and letters that end in .onion, and which you access with a special browser called the Tor browser.
Now, the Tor browser was originally a U.S. Naval intelligence project.
It then became open source, and it allows anybody to browse the net without giving away their location.
You will find libraries of pirated books.
But you'll also find the drugs markets, illegal pornography, commercial hacking services, and much more besides.
Now, the dark net is one of the most interesting, exciting places anywhere on the net.
Some of the unscrupulous dealers were running away with peoples' bitcoin before they'd mailed the drugs out.
The community came up with a solution, called multi-signature escrow payments.
So on purchasing my item, I would send my bitcoin to a neutral, secure third digital wallet.
There's even a mystery shopper.
Now, whatever you think about the morality of these sites -- and I submit that it's not actually an easy question -- the creation of functioning, competitive, anonymous markets, where nobody knows who anybody else is, constantly at risk of being shut down by the authorities, is a staggering achievement, a phenomenal achievement.
And it's that kind of innovation that's why those on the fringes are often the harbingers of what is to come.
And there are hundreds of activists around the world working on techniques and tools to keep you private online -- default encrypted messaging services.
Ethereum, which is a project which tries to link up the connected but unused hard drives of millions of computers around the world, to create a sort of distributed Internet that no one really controls.
Now, we've had distributed computing before, of course.
You may be asking yourselves that very question.
Now, I know of course, we have to make a living, but nobody in this room thinks that that's the answer to the question, "Why do we work?"
For folks in this room, the work we do is challenging, it's engaging, it's stimulating, it's meaningful.
Whether your response to poverty is resignation or revolution, depends on how you understand the sources of your poverty.
This is the role that ideas play in shaping us as human beings, and this is why idea technology may be the most profoundly important technology that science gives us.
And there's something special about idea technology, that makes it different from the technology of things.
Rituals, relationships, restrictions.
Take a piece of paper and put those three words on top of three columns, then try to fill those columns as honestly as you can.
A very different picture of your life in local context, of your identity as a set of experiences, may emerge.
It's not because I wasn't born there.
My father can't go back, either.
The country in which he was born, that country no longer exists.
And in fact, draining a swamp to make way for agriculture and development was considered the very essence of conservation not too long ago.
But now we're backpedaling, because the more we come to learn about these sodden landscapes, the more secrets we're starting to unlock about interspecies relationships and the connectivity of habitats, watersheds and flyways.
Take this bird, for example: this is the prothonotary warbler.
This is a bird the size of a tennis ball -- I mean, that's crazy!
I used a GPS to get here today, and this is my hometown.
It's crazy.
And when I say Everglades, most people are like, "Oh, yeah, the national park."
But the Everglades is not just a park; it's an entire watershed, starting with the Kissimmee chain of lakes in the north, and then as the rains would fall in the summer, these downpours would flow into Lake Okeechobee, and Lake Okeechobee would fill up and it would overflow its banks and spill southward, ever slowly, with the topography, and get into the river of grass, the Sawgrass Prairies, before meting into the cypress slews,
until going further south into the mangrove swamps, and then finally -- finally -- reaching Florida Bay, the emerald gem of the Everglades, the great estuary, the 850 square-mile estuary.
And I took this platform down to Lake Okeechobee and I spent over a week in the water, wading waist-deep, 9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk, to get one image that I thought might communicate this.
And here's the day that it finally worked: [Video:  After setting up the platform, I look off and I see a kite coming over the cattails.
And I see him scanning and searching.
And he gets right over the trap, and I see that he's seen it.
And he beelines, he goes straight for the trap.
And in that moment, all those months of planning, waiting, all the sunburn, mosquito bites --  Oh my gosh, I can't believe it!] You can believe how excited I was when that happened.
It's a wetland of international importance.
And we've come a long way in the last 60 years.
And as the world's largest and most ambitious wetland restoration project, the international spotlight is on us in the Sunshine State.
But it's up to us to decide which legacy we want to attach our flag to.
They say that the Everglades is our greatest test.
If we pass it, we get to keep the planet.
Gender-specific medicine is good for men, too.
But you bring to a crisis the person you already are, including the, yes, momentum that you've learned to invoke through passionate caring and through action, both of which require but also create energy.
So as an activist, I began working with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation -- that's pdf.org -- to create a major initiative to put women on the Parkinson's disease map.

And as a poet, I began working with this subject matter, finding it tragic, hilarious, sometimes even joyful.
I do not feel diminished by Parkinson's; I feel distilled by it, and I actually very much like the woman I'm distilling into.
Not a problem.
Skip over all the pages reassuring religious people.
Already a universal donor: kidneys, corneas, liver, lungs, tissue, heart, veins, whatever.
And this one's called "The Ghost Light."
Lit from within is the sole secure way to traverse dark matter.
Some life forms -- certain mushrooms, snails, jellyfish, worms -- glow bioluminescent, and people as well; we emit infra-red light from our most lucent selves.
How could I help these people?

I live in a country that was a beautiful country.
I just want to share this with you.
My body was slowly getting stronger.
I had a job in computing that I loved, and had even got Kojak, the dog I had been dreaming about for years.
However, I longed to share my life with someone.
Sandrine Thuret: Very good.
MH: I'm really interested in the running thing.
Do I have to run?
MH: I'm really interested in the running thing.
Do I have to run?
Or is it really just about aerobic exercise, getting oxygen to the brain?
I want to talk to you about the future of medicine.
But before I do that, I want to talk a little bit about the past.
Now, throughout much of the recent history of medicine, we've thought about illness and treatment in terms of a profoundly simple model.
Here you had a chemical, either from the natural world or artificially synthesized in the laboratory, it would find its target, lock into its target -- a microbe or some part of a microbe -- and then turn off a lock and a key with exquisite deftness, exquisite specificity.
And you would end up taking a previously fatal, lethal disease -- a pneumonia, syphilis, tuberculosis -- and transforming that into a curable, or treatable illness.
You have a pneumonia, you take penicillin, you kill the microbe and you cure the disease.
So seductive was this idea, so potent the metaphor of lock and key and killing something, that it really swept through biology.
It was a transformation like no other.
And we've really spent the last 100 years trying to replicate that model over and over again in noninfectious diseases, in chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and heart disease.
It's worked for diseases like leukemia.
It's worked for some forms of breast cancer, but eventually you run to the ceiling of that approach.
And it's only in the last 10 years or so that we've begun to think about using the immune system, remembering that in fact the cancer cell doesn't grow in a vacuum.
We're trying to change the metabolic milieu for other forms of cancer.
Or take another disease, like depression.
Again, working upwards, since the 1960s and 1970s, we've tried, again, desperately to turn off molecules that operate between nerve cells -- serotonin, dopamine -- and tried to cure depression that way, and that's worked, but then that reached the limit.
But perhaps what's really at stake are three more intangible M's: mechanisms, models, metaphors.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I really like this metaphor.
Well, we asked a team of economists at Deloitte who checked and crunched the numbers, and they came back and said, well, look: if the world's average wealth goes from $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year, social progress is going to increase from 61 to 62.4.
Just 62.4. Just a tiny increase.
Now this seems a bit strange.
Well then, we get to nearly 73, very close to the Global Goals.
Can we achieve the Global Goals?
Certainly not with business as usual.
It's right at the southernmost tip of Norway.
And on January 2 this year, an elderly guy who lives in the village, he went out to see what was cast ashore during a recent storm.
And on a patch of grass right next to the water's edge, he found a wetsuit.

The customer paid cash.
There was no surveillance footage from the shop.
So it became a cold case.
What was left of Shadi was found nearly three months later, 800 kilometers away in a wetsuit on a beach in Norway.
He's still waiting for his funeral in Norway, and none of his family will be able to attend.
Many may think that the story about Shadi and Mouaz is a story about death, but I don't agree.
And this is all within our reach pretty easily.
But if you are fleeing a war zone, the answers to those two questions are dramatically different.
A better life is a life in safety.
Tomm Christiansen: The first time we were in Calais, it was about 1,500 refugees there.
They had a difficult time, but they were positive, they had hope.
The last time, the camp has grown, maybe four or five thousand people.
And scientists in Philadelphia showed they could use CRISPR to remove the DNA of an integrated HIV virus from infected human cells.
The opportunity to do this kind of genome editing also raises various ethical issues that we have to consider, because this technology can be employed not only in adult cells, but also in the embryos of organisms, including our own species.
And so, together with my colleagues, I've called for a global conversation about the technology that I co-invented, so that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications of a technology like this.
So those little bits of RNA from the CRISPR locus associate -- they bind -- to protein called Cas9, which is white in the picture, and form a complex that functions like a sentinel in the cell.
It searches through all of the DNA in the cell, to find sites that match the sequences in the bound RNAs.
And when those sites are found -- as you can see here, the blue molecule is DNA -- this complex associates with that DNA and allows the Cas9 cleaver to cut up the viral DNA.
And when those sites are found -- as you can see here, the blue molecule is DNA -- this complex associates with that DNA and allows the Cas9 cleaver to cut up the viral DNA.
It makes a very precise break.
So we can think of the Cas9 RNA sentinel complex like a pair of scissors that can cut DNA -- it makes a double-stranded break in the DNA helix.
As I'm going to tell you now, we recognized that that activity could be harnessed for genome engineering, to allow cells to make a very precise change to the DNA at the site where this break was introduced.
That's sort of analogous to the way that we use a word-processing program to fix a typo in a document.
The reason we envisioned using the CRISPR system for genome engineering is because cells have the ability to detect broken DNA and repair it.
Genome engineering is actually not new, it's been in development since the 1970s.
We've had technologies for sequencing DNA, for copying DNA, and even for manipulating DNA.
And these technologies were very promising, but the problem was that they were either inefficient, or they were difficult enough to use that most scientists had not adopted them for use in their own laboratories, or certainly for many clinical applications.
The technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell's DNA affect either a tissue or, in this case, an entire organism.
the CRISPR technology was used to disrupt a gene by making a tiny change in the DNA in a gene that is responsible for the black coat color of these mice.
Imagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter-mates by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome, and they're otherwise completely normal.
There is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light.
And you may wonder, what's the point?
And the point is this: There will be a massive extension of the Internet to close the digital divide, and also to allow for what we call "The Internet of Things" -- tens of billions of devices connected to the Internet.
This is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light.
Now what I would like to do first is switch on the light, and I'll simply, only switch on the light, for a moment, and what you'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right.
So the solar cell, for a moment, is harvesting energy from this artificial light source.

So the solar cell, for a moment, is harvesting energy from this artificial light source.
If I turn it off, we see it drops.
And let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell.
First you notice the energy harvested drops, as expected, but now the video still continues.
This means, despite the blockage, there's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell, so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information, in this case, a high-definition video.
Now, in 2009, Michelle Obama was the victim of a racist campaign, where people set out to insult her through her search results.
There was a picture distributed widely over the Internet where her face was distorted to look like a monkey.
And that picture was published all over.
So we took this needle and bent it back into itself, into a loop of interconnected activities.
Our idea was to bring all aspects of television-making into one single structure: news, program production, broadcasting, research and training, administration -- all into a circuit of interconnected activities where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration.
I still very much like this image.
Those are tightly intertwined with social clusters: meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas -- informal spaces for people to meet and exchange.
So the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid between the technical and the social, the human and the performative.
And of course, we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system, to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity.
And they're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building.
They're a piece of glass that you can stand on and watch the city pass by below you in slow motion.
The building has become part of everyday life in Beijing.

It is there.
So architecture suddenly assumes the quality of a player, of something that writes stories and performs stories.
And I think that could be one of its primary meanings that we believe in.
But of course, there's another story to this building.
They're open, permeable; they're interconnected.
We called the project "The Interlace," thinking that we interlace and interconnect the human beings and the spaces alike.
And the detailed quality of everything we designed was about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants.
And you can see how its cantilevering volumes project out and engage the public space and how its courtyards animate the public inside.
The idea was to create a complex system in which institutional entities could maintain their own identity, in which they would not be subsumed in a singular volume.
Here's a scale comparison to the Centre Pompidou in Paris.
There are three main types of communication, spoken, gestural -- so things like sign language -- and graphic communication.
Spoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral.
It requires close contact for a message to be sent and received.
Or maybe even rivers, mountains, trees -- landscape features, possibly like this black penniform surrounded by strange bell-shaped signs from the site of El Castillo in Spain.
The term penniform means "feather-shaped" in Latin, but could this actually be a depiction of a plant or a tree?
Some researchers have begun to ask these questions about certain signs at specific sites, but I believe the time has come to revisit this category as a whole.
And that's why I'm here today, to share my journey with you and to take you along with me.
So, we start with the last breath.
As you noticed, that last breath in is slow, deep and intense.
It's caused by nitrogen dissolving in the blood, which causes confusion between the conscious and unconscious mind.
A flurry of thoughts goes spinning through your head.
You can't control them, and you shouldn't try to -- you have to let it happen.

Luckily, it's far from just that.
For the past few years, I've been trying to show another side of free diving, because the media mainly talks about competitions and records.
But free diving is more than just that.

It's about being at ease in the water.
So it's not about getting two feet.
I think what many people do not understand is they think climate change is something that is happening in the future.
Well, we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum.
It's a new experience.
And I've just come back from my own constituency, and I've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades, they've been totally destroyed.
So this is what's happening, but when we talk about the rising sea level, we think it's something that happens gradually.
And so it's about them that we should be telling everybody, that it's not about their own national interest, because climate change, regrettably, unfortunately, is viewed by many countries as a national problem. It's not.
And this is the argument we got into recently with our partners, the Australians and New Zealanders, because they said, "We can't cut any more."
This is what one of the leaders, the Australian leader, said, that we've done our part, we are cutting back.
The women would tell the men what to do.
And the men didn't rape me because it was just a normal opening, and it was all public, and they were with their wives.
They carried me around and put me on the table, and put the knife between my legs.
You have the painting on the wall, the next day it's there.
Performance, if you are missing it, you only have the memory, or the story of somebody else telling you, but you actually missed the whole thing.
So you have to be there.
But Rafidah's kindness proved to be the pattern for that year.
Time and again, people went out of their way to help me.
Some took on research on my behalf, and others made detours on holidays and business trips to go to bookshops for me.
It's hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now are literally bacteria and algae and slime.
Now, this is the part of the talk where you may expect me to launch into my plea for us to all save the coral reefs.
But I have a confession to make: that phrase drives me nuts.
But I have a confession to make: that phrase drives me nuts.
Whether I see it in a tweet, in a news headline or the glossy pages of a conservation brochure, that phrase bothers me, because we as conservationists have been sounding the alarms about the death of coral reefs for decades.
And yet, almost everyone I meet, no matter how educated, is not sure what a coral is or where they come from.

How would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs when it's an abstract thing they can barely understand?
How would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs when it's an abstract thing they can barely understand?
If they don't understand what a coral is or where it comes from, or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is, why would we expect them to care about saving them?
So let's change that.
Because even in some of these reefs that we probably could have written off long ago, we sometimes see baby corals arrive and survive anyway.
And we're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability to adjust to some of the conditions that the adults couldn't.
They may be able to adjust ever so slightly more readily to this human planet.

it has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon.
with the amount of salmon that we're producing.
Aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet.
Gases are trapped in the ice cores, so we can measure CO2 -- that's why we know CO2 was lower in the past -- and the chemistry of the ice also tells us about temperature in the polar regions.
And if you move in time from 20,000 years ago to the modern day, you see that temperature increased.
It didn't increase smoothly.
It was different in the two polar regions, and CO2 also increased in jumps.
So we're pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this.
The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon, about 60 times more than is in the atmosphere.
And this animal you're going to see coming up was a big surprise.
I've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised.
This was after about 15 hours of work and we were all a bit trigger-happy, and suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past.
And then if we analyze corals closer to the modern day, or indeed if we go down there today anyway and measure the chemistry of the corals, we see that we move to a position where carbon can exchange in and out.
So this is the way we can use fossil corals to help us learn about the environment.
So I want to leave you with this last slide.
And we've got to make something different happen.
JF: Women's friendships are like a renewable source of power.
LT: Well, that's what's exciting about this subject.

Justice Ginsberg said something like -- every constitution that's been written since the end of World War II included a provision that made women citizens of equal stature, but ours does not.
So that would be a good place to start.
Very, very mild -- JF: Right.
It's simply too massive, too vast, too endless.
And what do you see here?
I think most people actually look past to the horizon.
Two new ideas were turning the subject on its head.
One was Einstein's theory of relativity, the other was arguably even more revolutionary: quantum mechanics, a mind-meltingly strange yet stunningly successful new way of understanding the microworld, the world of atoms and particles.
Over the last century, these two ideas have utterly transformed our understanding of the universe.
The next few years may tell us whether we'll be able to continue to increase our understanding of nature, or whether maybe for the first time in the history of science, we could be facing questions that we cannot answer, not because we don't have the brains or technology, but because the laws of physics themselves forbid it.
This is the essential problem: the universe is far, far too interesting.
Relativity and quantum mechanics appear to suggest that the universe should be a boring place.
We all got so excited because finding the Higgs proves the existence of a cosmic energy field.
Now, you may have trouble imagining an energy field, but we've all experienced one.
If you've ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal and felt a force pulling across that gap, then you've felt the effect of a field.

It's all around us right now.
We can't see it or touch it, but if it wasn't there, we would not exist.
The Higgs field gives mass to the fundamental particles that we're made from.
In both of these scenarios, atoms could not exist, and therefore all the other interesting stuff that we see around us in the universe would not exist.
In reality, the Higgs field is just slightly on, not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker than its fully on value, a bit like a light switch that's got stuck just before the off position.
And this value is crucial.
And this value is crucial.
If it were a tiny bit different, then there would be no physical structure in the universe.
So this is the first of our dangerous numbers, the strength of the Higgs field.
We often use the word "astronomical" when we're talking about big numbers.
Well, even that one won't do here.
This number is bigger than any number in astronomy.
Today, we have more than 60 million.
At that time, we had had, recently, some conflicts that were solved.
Now, we see a multiplication of new conflicts and the old conflicts never died: Afghanistan, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo.
I saw myself in his picture.
I thought, "I could be Khaled."
I could not sleep that night, and I decided to do something.
We were engaging them.
We were calling collectively for actions, and sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know.
The page became the most followed page in the Arab world.

Late in January 1975, a 17-year-old German girl called Vera Brandes walked out onto the stage of the Cologne Opera House.
The auditorium was empty.
The opera house had provided the wrong instrument.
This one had this harsh, tinny upper register, because all the felt had worn away.
The black notes were sticking, the white notes were out of tune, the pedals didn't work and the piano itself was just too small.
And the audience loved it.
Audiences continue to love it because the recording of the Köln Concert is the best-selling piano album in history and the best-selling solo jazz album in history.
Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess.
Some of Carson's undergraduate subjects struggled with that.
They had weak filters, they had porous filters -- let a lot of external information in.
And so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted by the sights and the sounds of the world around them.
And if you start with the randomness, that becomes less likely, and your problem-solving becomes more robust.
Let's talk about social psychology.
So the psychologist Katherine Phillips, with some colleagues, recently gave murder mystery problems to some students, and these students were collected in groups of four and they were given dossiers with information about a crime -- alibis and evidence, witness statements and three suspects.
So Phil Collins was playing drums on an early Brian Eno album.
He got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio.
Carlos Alomar, great rock guitarist, working with Eno on David Bowie's "Lodger" album, and at one point he turns to Brian and says, "Brian, this experiment is stupid."
But in the last decade, we've seen the combined effects of climate change, population growth and competition for water resources threaten these vital lifelines and water resources.
This figure shows you the change in the lake level of Lake Mead that happened in the last 15 years.
You can see starting around the year 2000, the lake level started to drop.
Well, in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for, it's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way of providing ourselves with water.
Some people think that we're going to solve the urban water problem by taking water from our rural neighbors.
But that's an approach that's fraught with political, legal and social dangers.
This figure here shows the stormwater park that they're building by hooking a series of stormwater collection systems, or storm sewers, and routing that water into an abandoned gravel quarry.
The water that's captured in the quarry is slowly passed through a man-made wetland, and then it goes into that ball field there and percolates into the ground, recharging the drinking water aquifer of the city.
And in the process of passing through the wetland and percolating through the ground, the water encounters microbes that live on the surfaces of the plants and the surfaces of the soil, and that purifies the water.

And in the process of passing through the wetland and percolating through the ground, the water encounters microbes that live on the surfaces of the plants and the surfaces of the soil, and that purifies the water.
In the first step in this process we pressurize the water and pass it through a reverse osmosis membrane: a thin, permeable plastic membrane that allows water molecules to pass through but traps and retains the salts, the viruses and the organic chemicals that might be present in the wastewater.
In the second step in the process, we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide and shine ultraviolet light on the water.
The ultraviolet light cleaves the hydrogen peroxide into two parts that are called hydroxyl radicals, and these hydroxyl radicals are very potent forms of oxygen that break down most organic chemicals.
This is an engineered treatment wetland that we recently built on the Santa Ana River in Southern California.
The treatment wetland receives water from a part of the Santa Ana River that in the summertime consists almost entirely of wastewater effluent from cities like Riverside and San Bernardino.
The water comes into our treatment wetland, it's exposed to sunlight and algae and those break down the organic chemicals, remove the nutrients and inactivate the waterborne pathogens.
So, let's create a water supply that will be able to withstand any of the challenges that climate change throws at us in the coming years.
Let's create a water supply that uses local sources and leaves more water in the environment for fish and for food.
Let's create a water system that's consistent with out environmental values.
He said, "Dear James Veitch, We shall be shipping Gold to you."
"You will earn 10% of any gold you distributes."
So I knew I was dealing with a professional.
The Turing test was first proposed by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950, in order to answer the question, can computers think?
Alan Turing believed that if a computer was able to have a to have a text-based conversation with a human, with such proficiency such that the human couldn't tell whether they are talking to a computer or a human, then the computer can be said to have intelligence.
So in 2013, my friend Benjamin Laird and I, we created a Turing test for poetry online.

But basically, it's the game we just played.
You're presented with a poem, you don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer So thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online, so we have results.
And what are the results?
And Poem 2 was generated by an algorithm called RKCP.
Now before we go on, let me describe very quickly and simply, how RKCP works.
So RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil, who's a director of engineering at Google and a firm believer in artificial intelligence.
So RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil, who's a director of engineering at Google and a firm believer in artificial intelligence.
So, you give RKCP a source text, it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language, and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text. So in the poem we just saw before, Poem 2, the one that you all thought was human, it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called Emily Dickinson it looked at the way she used language, learned the model,
and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure.
and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure.
But the important thing to know about RKCP is that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using.
The language is just raw material, it could be Chinese, it could be in Swedish, it could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day.
Of course, this doesn't mean that William Blake was actually more human or that Gertrude Stein was more of a computer.
It simply means that the category of the human is unstable.
This has led me to understand that the human is not a cold, hard fact.

This has led me to understand that the human is not a cold, hard fact.

So my final insight is that the computer, more or less, works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it.

We show it Gertrude Stein, what we get back is Gertrude Stein.
We show it Gertrude Stein, what we get back is Gertrude Stein.
More than any other bit of technology, the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it.
So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence recently.
Can we build a creative computer?
What we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human-like computer?
But what we've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact, that it's an ever-shifting, concatenating idea and one that changes over time.
And I want to give a full TED Talk on corals and just how cool these things are.
One of the things that they do, one of their miraculous feats, is they produce lots of these fluorescent proteins, fluorescent molecules.
And in this coral, it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass -- could be this fluorescent protein.
And here's our footage.
They're the most cryptic fish.
You could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse.
And then the movement stops, like a caesura in poetry and the creator hovers.
So what's he doing?
Is he creating land? Is he creating sea?
But he's about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath Noah: emerald, topaz, scarlet on the prophet Zechariah.
Zechariah foresees a light coming from the east, and we are turned at this juncture to a new destination, with sibyls and prophets who will lead us on a parade.
You have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way, and we follow the mothers and fathers.
They are the ones who have overcome adversity, and Michelangelo's vision of people who combat adversity, overcome obstacles -- they're just like athletes.
So you have men and women flexing and posing in this extraordinary spotlight.
Presiding over this assembly is Jesus, first a suffering man on the cross, now a glorious ruler in Heaven.
It was something that happened over the space of 20 years of editorials and complaints, saying to the Church, "You can't possibly tell us how to live our lives.
Did you notice you have pornography in the Pope's chapel?"
And so after complaints and insistence of trying to get this work destroyed, it was finally the year that Michelangelo died that the Church finally found a compromise, a way to save the painting, and that was in putting up these extra 30 covers, and that happens to be the origin of fig-leafing.
We've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work or how to talk to them.
And we do teach our kids how the human body works, we teach them how the combustion engine functions and we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one.
But when the kid comes to us and asks, "So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?"
Her name is Ruby, she is six years old.
She is completely fearless, imaginative and a little bit bossy.
And every time I would run into a problem in trying to teach myself programming like, "What is object-oriented design or what is garbage collection?", I would try to imagine how a six-year-old little girl would explain the problem.
And idealistic foxes, and so on.
In Ruby's world, you learn technology through play.
And, for instance, computers are really good at repeating stuff, so the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this.
And I would ask, "Which one of these do you think is a computer?"
And the kids would be very conservative and go, "None of these is a computer.
I know what a computer is: it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time."
But I tell them, "Don't worry, your parents don't know the right answer, either.
They've just started to hear about this thing called The Internet of Things.
But you kids, you are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer."
They've just started to hear about this thing called The Internet of Things.
But you kids, you are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer."
And then I had this little girl who came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said, "This bicycle lamp, if it were a computer, it would change colors."
And that's the moment I'm looking for, the moment when the kid realizes that the world is definitely not ready yet, that a really awesome way of making the world more ready is by building technology and that each one of us can be a part of that change.
Final story, we also built a computer.
And we got to know the bossy CPU and the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things.
Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here, and as you'll see later, it can also swim.
So you might ask, why did we design this robot?
And in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience.
But the more I work in biorobotics, the more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion.
If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around, or even us as humans, when you go jogging or play tennis, we do amazing things.
And in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem.
It makes a wonderful link between swimming, as you find it in eels or fish, and quadruped locomotion, as you see in mammals, in cats and humans.
And in fact, the modern salamander is very close to the first terrestrial vertebrate, so it's almost a living fossil, which gives us access to our ancestor, the ancestor to all terrestrial tetrapods.
So the salamander swims by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait, so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail.
The last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb, so to handle impacts and forces.
And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.
So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.
And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub.

So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight, and also very elastic, so you can easily press it down and it will not break.
That's why, if there's a lesion of the spinal cord, this has dramatic effects.
The person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic.
This is because the brain loses this communication with the spinal cord.
We just can't help ourselves.
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits, which is why this disenchantment is so important.
Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level -- to know it in our bones so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior.
We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point.
Now, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior.
But in one study, we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking.
And more importantly, it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism.
The definition of capitalism, very simply put, is that the factors of production, such as trade and industry, capital and labor, are left in the hands of the private sector and not the state.
It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism.

It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism.
And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term, we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance.

And we have countries such as China, which have practiced more state capitalism, and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist.
Our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however, have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism.
However, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States.

However, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States.
This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality -- the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.
For example, sending children to school, parents could earn money for that, or getting their children inoculated or immunized, parents could get paid for doing that.
Now, quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway, the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico, in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York.
But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left-leaning policies.
Is that what you're suggesting?
DM: I'm suggesting we have to be open-minded.
I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to.
And the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number, by the end of this century, at 11 billion, which means that we are going to need a lot more protein.
This challenge is staggering -- so much so, that recently, a team at Anglia Ruskin Global Sustainability Institute suggested that if we don't change our global policies and food production systems, our societies might actually collapse in the next 30 years.
Currently, our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein.
Fish is the last food that we hunt.
And why is it that we keep hearing phrases like, "Life's too short for farmed fish," or, "Wild-caught, of course!"
over fish that we know virtually nothing about?
And why is it that we keep hearing phrases like, "Life's too short for farmed fish," or, "Wild-caught, of course!"
over fish that we know virtually nothing about?
We don't know what it ate during its lifetime, and we don't know what pollution it encounters.
We don't know.
Very few people realize the traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter that caught the wild animal.
But let's back up for a second and talk about why fish is the best food choice.
It's not sustainable, it's not healthy.
Have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean?
Of course not.
If you feed salmon soy with nothing else, it literally explodes.
Salmon is a carnivore, it has no way to digest soy.
Now, fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to humankind.
Insects are the -- well, first of all, the perfect recycling because they're grown on food waste; but second, think of fly-fishing, and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed.
You don't need large tracts of land for it and you don't need to cut down rain forests for it.
And microbes and insects are actually net water producers.
Tomorrow, there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing.
So somebody needs to connect the dots and give these developments a big kick in the butt.
And that's what we've been working on the last couple of years, and that's what we need to be working on together -- rethinking everything from the ground up, with a holistic view across the value chain, connecting all these things across the globe, alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision.
It's possible.
So we need to take pressure off the ocean.
We want to eat good and healthy.
You can help speed this up.
Ask questions when you order seafood.
Where does my fish come from?

It's a crude but convenient proxy for more important factors, like muscle mass, enzyme level, genetic traits they just don't have time to look for.
But race is a bad proxy.
In many cases, race adds no relevant information at all.
She told me, "Camouflage."
So that awesome little kid, she came home from school last October from her half day of preschool with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her when she tried to use the girls' bathroom.
And the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys' bathroom.
Why do I care about this problem? I care about it deeply.
I'm an informatics and data science guy and really, in my opinion, the only hope -- only hope -- to understand these interactions is to leverage lots of different sources of data in order to figure out when drugs can be used together safely and when it's not so safe.
So let me tell you a data science story.
And these reports are pretty simple: it has all the diseases that the patient has, all the drugs that they're on, and all the adverse events, or side effects, that they experience.
It is not all of the adverse events that are occurring in America today, but it's hundreds and hundreds of thousands of drugs.
So I said to Nick, "Let's think about glucose.
Harvard found 100 patients, same trend.
So at the end, we had 150 patients from three diverse medical centers that were telling us that patients getting these two drugs were having their glucose bump somewhat significantly.
More interestingly, we had left out diabetics, because diabetics already have messed up glucose.
And it turns out that about .5 to one percent of all searches on the Internet involve one of those words.
So that's our baseline rate.
If people type in "paroxetine" or "Paxil" -- those are synonyms -- and one of those words, the rate goes up to about two percent of diabetes-type words, if you already know that there's that "paroxetine" word.
People are worried about data.
They're worried about their privacy and security -- they should be.
We need secure systems.
We even have skyscrapers built for cars.
That's the world we live in today.
Now, cities have been dealing with this problem for decades.
And so we started thinking about, well, how do we make those two trips and turn them into one.
Because if we did, that ride would be a lot cheaper -- up to 50 percent cheaper -- and of course for the city you've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars.
And so the big question for us was: would it work?
But the part that I'm really --  But my favorite statistic -- remember, I'm from LA, I spent years of my life sitting behind the wheel, going, "How do we fix this?" -- my favorite part is that eight months later, we have added 100,000 new people that are carpooling every week.
Now, in China everything is supersized, and so we're doing 15 million uberPOOL trips per month, that's 500,000 per day.
And of course we're seeing that exponential growth happen.
UberX, when we first started, was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product.
It's now in many cities, half the price of a taxi.
And we have all the data to show that the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers.
That animal would have been incredibly dangerous, a menace to all around, and itself would have had nothing to fear.
And thus the name, "Dreadnoughtus," or, "fears nothing."
Now, to grow so large, an animal like Dreadnoughtus would've had to have been a model of efficiency.
They're now building better economies and communities where more people can succeed.
Over the past two years of using our product, Jenipher has increased her savings by 60 percent.
She's also started two additional food stalls and is now making plans for her own restaurant.
Because, first off, it makes you laugh.
And when you're laughing, you enter into a state of openness.
And in that moment of openness, a good social justice comedian can stick in a whole bunch of information, and if they're really skilled, a rectal exam.

Here are some ground rules for social justice comedy: first off, it's not partisan.
This isn't political comedy, this is about justice, and no one is against justice.

Two, it's inviting and warm, it makes you feel like you're sitting inside of a burrito.
I've been tagged in a photo.
When this appears, I can't help but click on it right now.
Right? Because, like, what if it's a bad photo?
that what if, instead of a spell check, you had a compassion check, meaning, you might highlight a word that might be accidentally abrasive -- perceived as abrasive by someone else.
So does this kind of conversation happen in the real world, not just in these design meetings?
Well, the answer is yes, and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.
If you didn't know, Couchsurfing is a website that matches people who are looking for a place to stay with a free couch, from someone who's trying to offer it.
So, great service -- what would their design goal be?
What are you designing for if you work at Couchsurfing?
And so you see, eventually for me to even be able to use my voice in my work was a huge step for me.
Every time I record audio, I fumble my way through saying each sentence many, many times, and then I go back in and pick the ones where I think I suck the least.
SS: Audio editing is like Photoshop for your voice.
But it's not just Homer.
If you look at all of the ancient literature -- Ancient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian and even the original Hebrew Bible -- they all mention very few colors.
And the most popular theory for why that might be the case is that cultures begin to recognize a color only once they have the ability to make that color.
A color like red, which was fairly easy for many cultures to make -- they began to see that color fairly early on.
But a color like blue, which was much harder to make -- many cultures didn't begin to learn how to make that color until much later.
They didn't begin to see it until much later as well.
But a color like blue, which was much harder to make -- many cultures didn't begin to learn how to make that color until much later.
They didn't begin to see it until much later as well.
So until then, even though a color might be all around them, they simply did not have the ability to see it.
SS: It just means I now have a much better understanding of what's at stake, and how giving up is not an option.
The Ancient Greeks didn't just wake up one day and realize that the sky was blue.
It took centuries, even, for humans to realize what we had been ignoring for so long.
This is a trigger that architects use to get you to create an emotional connection to the forms that we build our buildings out of.
It's a predictable emotional connection, and we've been using this trick for a long, long time.
We used it [200] years ago to build banks.
That's because there's never been a good feedback loop in architecture.
That's how we end up with buildings like this.
It's never going to happen again, I think, because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concrete, of steel, or of the elevator, and it's a media revolution.
This is the center of a town called the Pines in Fire Island in New York State.
It's a vacation community.
We proposed a building that was audacious, that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to, and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared, so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto Facebook and we put onto Instagram, and we let people start to do what they do: share it, comment, like it, hate it.
And it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature instead of the other way around.
It means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also be a place for sports and for yoga and you can even get married there late at night.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little reindeer pavilion that's as muscly and sinewy as the animals it's designed to observe.
and China, and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh.
So to be super clear, we're talking about the way you think you look, not how you actually look.
Low body confidence is undermining academic achievement.

Right now you have a movie playing inside your head.
It's an amazing multi-track movie.

I can't be certain that you guys are conscious.
Consciousness also is what makes life worth living.
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would have meaning or value.
Now, about 20 years ago, all that began to change.
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penrose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness.
And since then, there's been a real explosion, a flowering of scientific work on consciousness.

And since then, there's been a real explosion, a flowering of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.
So I think we're at a kind of impasse here.
We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation, we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains parts of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this picture.
This may sound a bit kooky to you.
I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?
Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental.
The amount of information integration falls off, but it's still non-zero.
On Tononi's theory, there's still going to be a non-zero degree of consciousness.
In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.

Now, I don't know if this theory is right, but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness, and it's been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data, and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.
Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world.
Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.

Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world.
Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
That's what physics really is ultimately doing, describing the flux of consciousness.
On this view, it's consciousness that puts the fire into the equations.
On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra.
Finally, you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups, the planet.
Does Canada have its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, does an integrated group like the audience at a TED conference, are we right now having a collective TED consciousness, an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts?
Does Canada have its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, does an integrated group like the audience at a TED conference, are we right now having a collective TED consciousness, an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it's at least one worth taking seriously.

Okay, so this panpsychist vision, it is a radical one, and I don't know that it's correct.
And these images, there are lots of them out there, they are what we call inspiration porn.
And I use the term porn deliberately, because they objectify one group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we're objectifying disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people.
They are not things to do with our bodies.
I use the term "disabled people" quite deliberately, because I subscribe to what's called the social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our diagnoses.
So I have lived in this body a long time.

I'm quite fond of it.
Genius.
We are learning from each others' strength and endurance, not against our bodies and our diagnoses, but against a world that exceptionalizes and objectifies us.
I really think that this lie that we've been sold about disability is the greatest injustice.
I want to live in a world where a 15-year-old girl sitting in her bedroom watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" isn't referred to as achieving anything because she's doing it sitting down.
I want to live in a world where we don't have such low expectations of disabled people that we are congratulated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement for disabled people, and I want to live in a world where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user.
Another flash alerts you to an open receiver.
You throw the ball, but you're hit right as you throw.
The ball comes off track.
Because I believe that we can use augmented reality for something more.
I believe we can use augmented reality as a way to foster more empathy within the human species itself, by literally showing someone what it looks like to walk a mile in another person's shoes.
We know what this technology is worth to sports leagues.
I recently retired from the California Highway Patrol after 23 years of service.
The majority of those 23 years was spent patrolling the southern end of Marin County, which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.
The bridge is an iconic structure, known worldwide for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.
And my mom asked me, "How come you always wear that t-shirt on your head?"
I said, "Mom, this is my hair. I'm a girl."
I knew then how to self-identify.
Dear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborn children, to be honest, but when I went and I looked into her eyes, believe me, I got extremely honored.
And long before she was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a heroic legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.
Her name was Malalai of Maiwand, and I named my daughter after her.
Dear brothers and sisters, we were striving for more rights for women, and we were struggling to have more, more and more space for the women in society.
But we came across a new phenomenon.
It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women's rights.
At the age of 10, Malala stood, and she stood for the right of education.
She wrote a diary for the BBC blog, she volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries, and she spoke from every platform she could.
And her voice was the most powerful voice.
Next let me share with you one other experiment, this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley.
In this experiment, individuals were shown hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while scans were made of their brains to create a large library of their brain reacting to video sequences.
Then a new movie was shown with new images, new people, new animals in it, and a new scan set was recorded.
And how will we learn to deal with the truths of unfiltered human thought?
You think the Internet was big.
These are huge questions.
But I would say nothing, and I would seethe inside.
So I promised myself, the next time, I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
I was not the militant lesbian ready to fight any four-year-old that walked into the cafe.
I was frozen by fear, curled up in the corner of my pitch-black closet clutching my gay grenade, and moving one muscle is the scariest thing I have ever done.
My family, my friends, complete strangers -- I had spent my entire life trying to not disappoint these people, and now I was turning the world upside down on purpose.
Is there a single equation for intelligence?
And the answer, I believe, is yes. ["F = T ∇ Sτ"] What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E = mc² for intelligence that I've seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement of correspondence that intelligence is a force, F, that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.
In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.
Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open.
And so, given this one equation, it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?

The first is that we will not evolve.
We have reached a kind of equipoise.
And the reasoning behind that would be, first, we have, through medicine, managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population.

So let me now introduce to you HULC -- or the Human Universal Load Carrier.
With the HULC exoskeleton, I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain for many hours.
Its flexible design allows for deep squats, crawls and high-agility movements.
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured, and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now.
Thank you.
Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set.
Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right?
Yeah.
So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans.
So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans.
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun.
But play's a shapeshifter.
And as we get farther and farther with our science, we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had are probably overly simplistic.
So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life.
One of the places we're seeing it, for example, in our culture today, in the United States today, is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.
We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human, such that it has a different right than a fetal life.
We have very difficult conversations nowadays -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody's dead.
In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead.
We have very difficult conversations nowadays -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody's dead.
In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead.
At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose, and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.
But today, we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings.
And as a consequence, we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who's dead, and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.
Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories would make somebody like me really happy.
I mean, they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that cheesy musical "1776" every few years, and it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.
It's because of what happened in 1776 with the Founding Fathers.
The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view, the original anatomical activists, and this is why.
The monarchs of the old world didn't have a concept of DNA, but they did have a concept of birthright.
They had a concept of blue blood.
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth.
I call this "Shiny Tiger."
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.
In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator.
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there.
In a certain sense, it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...
Well today, we know everything about where our objects come from.
This is a map that shows you all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.
But we know very little about where things go.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system.
So we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in Seattle, just over a year ago, to tag what they were throwing away -- different types of things, as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway.
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy.
This data was not available before.
But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.
So that was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman, he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing, but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning, and that's actuating our environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.
And we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo.
We called it Digital Water Pavilion.
The whole building is made of water.
And we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo.
We called it Digital Water Pavilion.
The whole building is made of water.
The roof also is covered with water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.
Or you could close the building, and the whole architecture will disappear, You know, these days, you always get images during the winter, when they take the roof down, of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building."
So here it is.
You can see on the left side a small boat.
That's about a 15-foot boat.

But for over two weeks, we programmed, we went to the Venice boardwalk, my kids got involved, my dog got involved, and we created this.
This is called the EyeWriter, and you can see the description.
This is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk, some copper wire and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack.
The epiphany is that death is a part of life.
She saved my life; I and my partner saved hers.
And you know, that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does.
She saved my life; I and my partner saved hers.
And you know, that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
I learned that it all changes in an instant.
We have this bucket list, we have these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't, all the fences I wanted to mend, all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did.
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a saying, which is, "I collect bad wines."
I want to tell you how we found that out.
When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago, it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.
The only thing that was known is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part, used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.
The dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found, and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect is actually running on that target.
And if not, Stuxnet does nothing.
So that really got my attention, and we started to work on this nearly around the clock, because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.
Anyway, so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target, but from different angles.
The small warhead is taking one cascade, and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down, and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves.
So in all, we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is.
So we don't have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet.
Here's some very cool stuff that we saw -- really knocked my socks off.
Down there is the gray box, and on the top you see the centrifuges.
But it gets worse.
And this is very important, what I'm going to say.
Think about this: this attack is generic.
And this is very important, what I'm going to say.
Think about this: this attack is generic.
It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics, with centrifuges, with uranium enrichment.
That was more for emphasis.
It was, "In perpetuity. Forever."
But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor, but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie.
I was amazed.
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.
Our politicians say it, our president says it, even our CEO's say it.
But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality, something suddenly changes.
But why? Well, transparency is scary -- like that odd, still-screaming bear.
But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality, something suddenly changes.
But why? Well, transparency is scary -- like that odd, still-screaming bear.
It's unpredictable -- like this odd country road.
That's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period.
That's only online -- no print, no TV.
The film hasn't even been distributed yet.
That's only online -- no print, no TV.
The film hasn't even been distributed yet.
It's not even online. It's not even streaming.
I probably shouldn't say that.
It really comes from these artists.
And that's been my humbling experience in this.
So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts, and then we develop our intuition from there.
And really you do the same thing.
So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time.
And when they play with their particles, they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And so they wrote down all these observations, and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.
And so that's where physics was at a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little, tiny particles.
This is a photograph of the object.
And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center.
And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.
And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer, and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming pool-shaped hole underneath the device.
The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people, but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.
And so we knew, if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically, we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.
And so that's what we did.

And so that's what we did.
We turned off the lights, and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air, and then we cooled it down Now, all alone in the elevator, the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.
And so we measured its motion.

And so we measured its motion.
We found it was moving in really weird ways.
And so we measured its motion.
We found it was moving in really weird ways.
Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating, and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this -- like expanding and contracting bellows.

The first point was the importance of rules, like those rules that say you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes technologies and rules to get progress, and it's usually the rules that hold us back.
In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.
And the insight of President Lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust.
We went and looked at a site.
This picture's from there.
And Gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all-expenses-paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here's a description of the road.
And I'd like you to read it.
Because it doesn't feel like real money.
And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more.
So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi and Alessandro Previtero, we did a study with people at ING -- employees that are all working at ING -- and now these people were all in a session where they're doing enrollment for their 401 plan.
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience.
It's Friday, Friday. Gotta get down on Friday. Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend. Friday, Friday. Gettin' down on Friday. So you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope.
Rebecca Black's "Friday" is one of the most popular videos of the year.
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it.
And now there are 10,000 parodies of "Friday" on YouTube.
Even in the first seven days, there was one parody for every other day of the week.
There were remixes.
Someone made an old timey version.
And then it went international.
I never knew him in real life.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never let me forget his life.
We were poor.
All the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out, which was usually new clothes; they were always secondhand.
Two pairs of stockings for school, each to hide the holes in the other.
At midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the casket.
My mother asked us to feel her hand.
She asked the monk, "Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold?"
My mother asked us to feel her hand.
She asked the monk, "Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold?"
"Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said.
Is it something about the light?
What creates the illusion?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.
But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations.
I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place than to find a place, because then you don't need to compromise with the ideas in your head.
But it does require a lot of planning.
So for example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are from a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.
How could we help you?"
And we think, we like to think, that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-health projects fail, since we stopped listening.
This is my WiFi scale. It's a very simple thing.
And every morning I hop on it.
And yes, I've got a challenge, as you might see.
And I put my challenge on 95 kg.
But on the other hand, it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health.
As of next week, it will soon be available.
There will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other.
We asked around and nobody knew.
Nobody knew where the nearest life-saving AED was to be obtained right now.
So what we did, we crowdsourced The Netherlands.


So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate; we have them work in government.
But one fellow in particular, a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober, noticed something else, and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things.
So he did what any good developer would do, he wrote an app.
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.
So he did what any good developer would do, he wrote an app.
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.
So you agree to dig it out when it snows.
So it's got cute little game dynamics on it.
This is a modest little app.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.
This is a modest little app.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.
But it's doing something that no other government technology does.
It's very important that these tsunami sirens work, but people steal the batteries out of them.
So he's getting citizens to check on them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.
There is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally, that's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government.
And not even like a tech company, but more like the Internet itself.
And that means permissionless, it means open, it means generative.
And that's important.
Now there's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively.
It's not just Code for America fellows, there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up on government.

It has an app, a Web and mobile app, called Citizens Connect.
Now we didn't write this app.
This is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.
And I don't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here.
I'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others.
So one citizen helped another citizen, but government played a key role here.
I'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others.
So one citizen helped another citizen, but government played a key role here.
It connected those two people.
Now in order to do that I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers.
Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things.
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth.
And I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder, which I try not to let the security people see at airports.
But this has in it -- what I did is I took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it -- and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and amplified it 10 to the 22 times.
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card, I have plenty for everyone in the room, and, in fact, everyone in the world, and it's right here.
And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that point, an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism, instead of over this evolutionary time span.
And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities.

Because at that point, an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism, instead of over this evolutionary time span.
So an organism could, for instance, learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism, whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures, that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit.
So that nervous system, the fact that they built these special information structures, Because evolution could now happen within an individual.
I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.
There are billions of them.
Instead, what I do and what the designers at Thinking Machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do, much farther and faster than we could ever do.
In fact, their life depended on doing the job.
I was riding in a 747 with Marvin Minsky once, and he pulls out this card and says, "Oh look. Look at this.
It says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight.' Doesn't that make you feel confident?"
It became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination.
So I felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming.
They stopped us from being inspired.
And so when I saw the iPad, I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world.
It can know how we're holding it.
It can know where we are.
And it opens up a map.
All along, all fantasy books have always had maps, but these maps have been static.
This is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.
I mean, it's fascinating.
In aviation, we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash.
But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem.

It's not our burden.
What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people, especially if they were disproportionately Jewish?
I couldn't bear it.
It would be unconscionable.
Well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in.
There is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering, to poverty, to exclusion, to unfairness, to injustice.
Now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this.
And I started working on this motion, and the head of the motion was: "Motion to try my poor, 14-year-old black male client like a privileged, white 75-year-old corporate executive."
And I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct.
There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county, it's all misconduct.
And I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct.
There was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this county, it's all misconduct.
And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion, or did I actually write it?
And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.
He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?"
And this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said, "I came into this courtroom to tell this young man, keep your eyes on the prize, hold on."
Number one, how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time, war time and peace time, recession, depression and boom time.
This is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers.
It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges.
But the King of Siam, he was fed with aluminum utensils.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, worth more than gold and platinum.
It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, worth more than gold and platinum.
It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass, it doesn't come as a pure metal.
Last month, MIT put out a study showing that by the end of this decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average.
And if we have abundant energy, we also have abundant water.
Now we talk about water wars.
And if we have abundant energy, we also have abundant water.
Now we talk about water wars.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth, in 1990 after it just passed Saturn?
We're challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to, because it's got A.I., you can cough on it, you can do a finger blood prick.
And to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board-certified doctors.
So literally, imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers.
The one thing I've learned at the X Prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things, things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past.
Let me share and close with a story that really got me excited.
There is a program that some of you might have heard of.

It's a game called Foldit.
And up until now, it's been a supercomputer problem.
And this game has been played by university professors and so forth.
And it's literally, hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it.
It's called batting average.
So we talk about a 300, a batter who bats 300.
That means that ballplayer batted safely, hit safely three times out of 10 at bats.
And here's the thing.
In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years, we can't keep up with it.
Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive.
This was the sailfin grouper.
A big fishery was run on it until the '80s.
Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List.
And hence, the enormous role that a marine protected area can play.
Because with marine protected areas, we actually recreate the past.
We recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low.
This is Bjorn Sundin.
This is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour and so on and so on.
These guys make their fortunes online, but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking, or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer.
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging.
First question to answer for us: so what?
Tell us why your science is relevant to us.
Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points?
What do bullets do? Bullets kill, and they will kill your presentation.
A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed.
A mobile phone can change your life, and gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change.
This is autumn 1989, and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket.
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you?
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you?
Hold it up.
Hold your phones up, hold your phones up!
Hold your phones up, hold your phones up!
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone.
Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art.
Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls, me, I beautiful lawns, parkways.
I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees, that's my embellishment for that cloth.
Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls, me, I beautiful lawns, parkways.
I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees, that's my embellishment for that cloth.
You'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas.
And I'm like, "Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it.
That's why it's on the street.
That's the whole idea.
I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes.
Now don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about no free shit, because free is not sustainable.
They didn't want to call him King in case that gave him ideas, or his successor ideas.
So they wanted to give him the humblest, meagerest, most pathetic title that they could think of.
And that title was "President."
And that title was "President."
President. They didn't invent the title. I mean, it existed before, but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting.
It was like the foreman of the jury.
It was like the foreman of the jury.
And it didn't have much more grandeur than the term "foreman" or "overseer."
There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government, but it was really a nothing title.
And try and use this campaign to expose these mafiosos who are masquerading as national heroes.
I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called "Payback" and impersonate a police officer, set up a fake checkpoint on the street of Kabul and stop cars, but instead of asking them for a bribe, offering them money and apologizing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they'll accept this 100 Afghanis on our behalf.
I want to look at how, in my opinion, the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict chic.
I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds.
Not everybody gets to do that.
These heels are very uncomfortable, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them.
What is it, then?
Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women?
Maybe what was missing was not the women only, but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.
Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women?
Maybe what was missing was not the women only, but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.
Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building more than it needed the elections, which only reinforced polarization and division.
And we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically.
According to a Quranic verse "Salam" -- peace -- "is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem."
In turn, the word "raheem," which is known in all Abrahamic traditions, has the same root in Arabic as the word "rahem" -- womb -- symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female, from which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from.
Remi is 22, tall and very handsome.
He's speechless, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot.
Remi knows what love is.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million, or a billion, but one trillion frames per second.
I present you a new type of photography, femto-photography, a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can look around corners, beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X-ray, and really challenge what we mean by a camera.
Many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air, and it's bouncing around inside.
Meanwhile, the ripples are traveling on the table, and because of the reflections at the top, you see at the back of the bottle, after several frames, the reflections are focused.
I thought, this is how nature paints a photo, one femto frame at a time, but of course our eye sees an integral composite.
But if you look at this tomato one more time, you will notice, as the light washes over the tomato, it continues to glow. It doesn't become dark.
Why is that? Because the tomato is actually ripe, and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato, and it comes out after several trillionths of a second.
So, Superman can fly.
Some other heroes can become invisible, but what about a new power for a future superhero: to see around corners?
The idea is that we could shine some light on the door.
So after our paper was published in Nature Communications, it was highlighted by Nature.com, and they created this animation.
We're going to fire those bullets of light, and they're going to hit this wall, and because the packet of the photons, they will scatter in all the directions, and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin, which in turn will again scatter that light, and again in turn the door will reflect some of that scattered light, and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera, but most interestingly, they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot.
And because we have a camera that can run so fast, our femto-camera, it has some unique abilities.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
And this way, we know the distances, of course to the door, but also to the hidden objects, but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance.
By shining one laser, we can record one raw photo, which, you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense, but then we will take a lot of such pictures, dozens of such pictures, put them together, and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light, and from that, can we see the hidden object?
Now, I live in New Orleans, and I am in love with New Orleans.
My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees, shading lovers, drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years, and I trust a city that always makes way for music.
I feel like every time someone sneezes, New Orleans has a parade.
My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees, shading lovers, drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years, and I trust a city that always makes way for music.
I feel like every time someone sneezes, New Orleans has a parade.
The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America.
But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life.
I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day, and forget what really matters to you.
So with help from old and new friends, I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a fill-in-the-blank sentence: "Before I die, I want to ... " So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk, reflect on their lives, and share their personal aspirations in public space.
However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease, and they have to live with incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease, so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progression objectively, and ultimately, the only way we're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure.
But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers, so there's no simple blood test that you can do, and the best that we have is like this 20-minute neurologist test.
So I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe that every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings deserves to know what psychologists, sociologists, neurologists and fertility specialists already know: that claiming your 20s is one of the simplest, yet most transformative, things you can do for work, for love, for your happiness, maybe even for the world.
This is not my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of life's most defining moments take place by age 35.
I was never caught.
But most of all, I am baffled by, why did it bother me so much that this little girl, this tiny little girl, was so good at spelling?
Jealousy baffles me.
We forget how harsh his vision was.
We forget how pitiless he is.
I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut.
This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.
Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine.
She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters.
But I like contingency plans.
So while we wait for that to happen, let us remember that we have fiction for consolation.
Fiction alone demystifies jealousy.
Behind the lean-to was a dump, maybe 40 feet square with rotting apple cores and balled-up aluminum foil, and a dead sneaker.
And I was astonished, I was very angry, and I was deeply confused.
The campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in, who did they think would clean up after them?
And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education.
Everyone asks about the smell.
And then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm.
I also learned about the relentlessness of trash.
When you step off the curb and you see a city from behind a truck, you come to understand that trash is like a force of nature unto itself.

It never stops coming.

It's also like a form of respiration or circulation.
You put on the uniform, and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you've blocked traffic with your truck, or you're taking a break too close to their home, or you're drinking coffee in their diner, and they will come and scorn you, and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.
I find the stigma especially ironic, because I strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first guardians of public health.
Look.
It's exhausting. I'm like Shakira, Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.
C.P. is not genetic.

So, if my three older sisters were mopping, I was mopping.
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that I went too, and if we didn't all get A's, we all got my mother's slipper.
My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine every single summer, we'd grow up to be Madonna.
Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me, so I drank deer's milk, I had hot cups on my back, I was dunked in the Dead Sea, and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking, "It's working! It's working!"
But one miracle cure we did find was yoga.
Sherry Brown got the part.
I went racing to the head of the theater department crying hysterically, like someone shot my cat, to ask her why, and she said it was because they didn't think I could do the stunts.
I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the stunts, neither can the character."
And she looked at me and she went, "Five, four, three, two ..."
And we were live, right?
So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk so that I wouldn't roll off the screen during the segment, and when the interview was over, I was livid.
President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer, most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy, and it is only in the last 10 years that effective, viable therapies have come to seem real.
Hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology.

Hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology.
It is not 1961.
There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War, no politician like John Kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous, and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system.
Most of all, going to the moon turned out to be easy.

I'd like to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home.
I was like, "Well I'm not Britney Spears, but maybe you could teach me.
I mean, you've got to start somewhere, right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.

Same word, different amount of remembering; that's weird.
What's going on here?
Well the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you.
What Simonides figured out at that moment is something that I think we all kind of intuitively know, which is that, as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers and word-for-word instructions from our colleagues, we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories.
If I asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Simonides, chances are you would have a tough time with it.
But I would wager that if I asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse in your foyer right now, you would be able to see that.

The idea behind the memory palace is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember -- the crazier, weirder, more bizarre, funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is, the more unforgettable it's likely to be.
This is advice that goes back 2,000-plus years to the earliest Latin memory treatises.
So how does this work?
These are just tricks.
They are tricks that work because they're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work.
And you don't have to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works.
I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate.
Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate, even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school.
So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out.
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments.
In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called "growth mindset."

This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort.
So I thought, this is what I really want to design, not a shopping mall.
But the question was how we could do a multistory, contemporary building with these principles.
The next challenge was when we looked at the site, that is, in a really growing area of the city, where most of these buildings that you see in the image, they were not there.
So what I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim, an aim and a task which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter.
First the claim: Why do people think trust has declined?
And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
Well, we can do that for ourselves.
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust.
It totally dominated her imagination for months.
Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.
It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand.
But you watch that movie enough times, and you start to realize how unusual it is.
Now we live today, and are raising our children, in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.
But "The Wizard of Oz" stood alone.
It does happen. I've seen it, and yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very high-quality movie, "Argo."
Right? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office, a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.

It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.

But his story takes a different route.
In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier to getting from point A to point B are the roads.
Twenty-three years of civil war have completely destroyed the road system, and a motorbike can be the easiest way to get around.
They need expertise and mentorship to guide them in developing and launching their businesses.
Connect young people with the resources they need, provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation, and you will create catalysts for urban growth.
For me, entrepreneurship is more than just starting up a business.
This area is huge -- it's four miles by three miles in size.
The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy, and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east, it covered over the city.
So, how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape?
We also have evidence of an elite jewelers workshop, showing that whatever was there was a very important city.
No Itjtawy was here yet, but we're going to be returning to the site in the near future to map it out.
And even more importantly, we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well.

Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the form of Chinese characters.
Ever since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
Remember fire?
Two fires together, I get really hot.
Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.
