It was printed in Monterey, I checked.
The sign is wrong.
A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy.
The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining.
And it comes out in May.
And it's how they link together.
And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge.
Become politically active.
And so this is what they do.
As it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village.
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it.
So you start with the bagasse, and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.
However, you can't burn this.
It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking.
And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of "manioc."
So we went back to MIT, we took out the Instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces you needed in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it?
Blood diamonds, smuggled emeralds, timber, that is cut right from under the poorest. Second is technical assistance.
Money is not capital in most of the developing countries.
It's just cash.
Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents; it could be 20 cents; or it could be four dollars.
The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe, was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon, take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys -- that's kind of cool.
Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.
Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.
Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family, which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing, Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it, the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars, will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA budgets for human space flight.
I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.
And they hadn't done anything because -- kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems, and we were asking them to create a problem.
And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married, the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.
The experiments are incredibly simple.
And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms.
I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold.
This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS.
And I have a copy.
She goes, "Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'"  Well, if you like that one -- how much time have we got?
And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades.
There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village.
I'm sorry; it's not one yet.
Either one, you're going to lose.
What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts.
Like, I get hundreds of them a day; period.
Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps.
They moved to an abandoned school.
KA: But then you've got to figure out a way -- we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing.
It looks like a fairly simple thing, but this was a half a million dollar project?
It looks like a fairly simple thing, but this was a half a million dollar project?
DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen.
So that, very much, is in the realm of things I've been interested in before.
KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.
The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation.
For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns.
So, the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.
It was half as long.
So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.
And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.
This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.
It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity, you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.
And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it, or watching their kids die.
We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the control group.
Anyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest.
And now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it.
And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called, than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred.
We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida are different from the problems in New York.
Secondly, the resilience of nature.
We can destroy a river, and we can bring it back to life.
And I had never been a reader when I was young -- my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew; I tried all that -- and I just didn't like reading books.
Because what stem cells are -- they're these phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate into any type of tissue.
And the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged, we need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung trying to repair -- because you have this excessive proliferation of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue.
But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response, but can't quite control it.
And I really think that we can't think about cancer -- let alone any disease -- in such black-and-white terms.
It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous.
It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous.
If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it, or somehow -- you know, it's contained. It's very contained.
And you think, the more highways there are in a tissue, the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases.
Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows that it needs this blood supply? It needs to be constantly contracting, so therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself.
Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells, and this is why it seems as if it is so rare.
But when the body is actually initiating a process and we're calling it a disease, it doesn't seem as though elimination is the right solution. So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched, that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy.
And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink.
They're still talking about it.
I knew Craig and respected him.
You can come to the opening. I'll invite you.
RSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people -- when Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ...
FG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it.
I don't have my own plane yet.
As Chaucer said, "Love is blind."
"I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat.
The motor of the brain. It's a drive.
They've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools.
They've been doing it for a million years; words were women's tools.
And there's also many more male idiots in the world.
So the divorce rate right now is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline.
I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it, too, the magic of it.
And this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect, and started to run along the water next to us, in a courtship dance -- for miles.
In other words: structure.
Light comes through, it bounces back off the layers; it's called thin-film interference. Imagine being able to self-assemble products with the last few layers playing with light to create color.
And that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf.
The one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air, does not drink fresh water.
Life -- and this is the secret trick; this is the magic trick -- life creates conditions conducive to life.
It builds soil; it cleans air; it cleans water; it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live.
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.
But at the other hand, a couple of years ago I gave up all of my possessions, sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle -- and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body, fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.
At the same time, I run a website on cool tools, where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology.
So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.
Obviously, this in an incomplete question, just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it.
We find life at the bottom of every long-term, long-distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.
And the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.
I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.
I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.
When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.
It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact, what's important is that this information actually never died out.
We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and took what I could find, the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology, and then I tried to find out when they came back in, because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time, the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited, is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology,
That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out.
And then what we see in the singularity, that prophesized by Kurzweil and others -- his idea that technology is accelerating evolution.
I'm going to skip through some of the objections because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.
I'm going to skip through some of the objections because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.
I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies. I don't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about, maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.
You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.
That is the infinite game. And what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game.
And it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.
And sure enough, if you sit down, and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce, you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups.
Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce, A.
And I said, "I'm going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award."
I brought this with me, this was given to us by NBC Dateline to test.
It's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia.
This was being sold to high-school administrators for $900 apiece.
You could dowse for all sorts of things, but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers.
I'll show you.
This casino paid $28,500 on eBay for the cheese sandwich.
And she wrote a beautiful song.
It was in the top five in 2005, called, "Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing."
I'm not going to spend too much time on that, but what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects that appear when an author publishes a book.
A little present for you.
Just to tell you quickly about it: this is an engineering textbook.
This costs -- anybody guess?
Because it's published on demand and it's developed from this repository of open materials.
So imagine your kid's algebra textbook in seventh grade.
So imagine your kid's algebra textbook in seventh grade.
So imagine your kid's algebra textbook in seventh grade.
Imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed.
Imagine chemistry textbooks that actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed.
Clicking on that logo takes you to an absolute no-nonsense, human-readable document, a deed, that tells you exactly what you can do with this content.
Not just text, but music, images, video.
It was when I put the water in that I realized that I'd put a skin on water itself.
It makes the product strong, the tessellation.
My office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum and a NASA space lab.
A meringue is made exactly the same way, in my estimation, as a bone.
It's made from polysaccharides and proteins.
I set out to look at natural forms.
That is the power of organic design.
That is an image of a car for me.
There's a hole at the front and there's a reason for that.
Can you imagine? A car on a stick.
Can you imagine? A car on a stick.
It's this holistic integration. That's my studio. It's subterranean.
It's next to David Hockney's original studio.
So I'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you'll see in the video.
So I'm just going to interject a little bit with some of the things that you'll see in the video.
Lots of stuff. There's a little leaf chair -- that golden looking thing is called "Leaf."
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread, and he focused, like most inventors did, on the patent part and the making part.
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread, and he focused, like most inventors did, on the patent part and the making part.
That just over the last few years, what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it's not working the way that it used to.
And when Lionel started his bakery, the French pooh-pooh-ed it.
They didn't want to buy his bread. It didn't look like "French bread."
It wasn't what they expected.
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world.
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars, 10 times the standard.
But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model.
But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne -- you don't have to be super-outrageous to do this.
That's a purple cow; that's something worth noticing.
So what was it about crack cocaine?
Because you could smoke crack cocaine -- you can't smoke powdered cocaine -- and smoking is a much more efficient mechanism of delivering a high than snorting it.
So here's what the org chart of the gang looks like.
I don't know if you know much about org charts, but if you were to assign a stripped-down and simplified McDonald's org chart, this is exactly what it would look like.
This is one of the basic ideas in labor economics, called a "compensating differential."
And along came a brilliant inventor, a scientist, who came up with a partial cure for that disease.
And it wasn't perfect. Many children still died, but it was certainly better than what they had before.
And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free, virtually free, and was very easy to use.
I would like you to approve it for selling," then they would say, "This is a fantastic new car seat, it works great.
And to be an architect, somehow you have to negotiate between left and right, and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place and the outside world, and then make it understood.
And this was the first prototype in Korea, as we're dealing with a dynamic envelope, and then the same characteristic of the fabric.
This will be the first building in the United States that took -- well, I can't say it took the air conditioning out. It's a hybrid.
There's some air conditioning left in the base, but the skin now moves on hydraulics.
It forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind.
So it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that Earth.
And what we really want to do -- well, the architects, if there are architects out there, this is the Laugier Hut; this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long -- and what we wanted to do is really build this, because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world, and we wanted them to look down at their satellite, how they see their own site, that eight-acre site,
And what you look at is an aircraft carrier that's performance-driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes.
And the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing, but something that's only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time.
And talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together, and then where part of it is in the ground, part of it is oppositional lifts.
And it makes for event space and then it breaks in places that allow you to peer into the interior, and those interiors, again, are promoting transparency for the workplace, which has been a continual interest of ours.
Nature is only a cultural edifice today, right?
But another layer of representation was still introduced.
And we're trying to figure that out, because it is an amazing capability.
I knew we'd have a hard time with what followed.
And they had just come down from the high pastures, at 18,000 feet.
But it slightly bores me.
And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know.
Not solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model, an electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know, length, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs.
Wilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator, Rosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model.
And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.
And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.
And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap.
And so we were left by ourselves, and trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you -- what does this genetic information do?
So, we started with breast cancer because there's lots of money for it, no government money.
So -- "The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad.
It was a 10 by 10 cell.

We hired Brian because he was working part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia, so we actually hired him, so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes.
So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is, why isn't it all rubbish? Why is the website as good as it is?
We should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it.
Every single change on the site goes to the "Recent changes" page.
And then users can set up their own personal watch list.
And therefore, what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly, and then they'll just simply revert the change.
So the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works, it's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work, but we are not fanatical web anarchists.
It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers.
There are nano-engineered designs, which at least have been analyzed theoretically, that show the potential to be very lightweight, very inexpensive, very efficient, and we'd be able to actually provide all of our energy needs in this renewable way.
I put 49 famous computers on this logarithmic graph -- by the way, a straight line on a logarithmic graph is exponential growth -- that's another exponential.
They put tens of thousands of these in the blood cell -- they tried this in rats -- it lets insulin out in a controlled fashion, and actually cures type 1 diabetes.
This will be a routine feature in a cell phone.
I mean, we will have two-to-the-25th-power greater price performance, capacity and bandwidth of these technologies, which is pretty phenomenal.
We routinely do intellectual feats that would be impossible without our technology.
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.
What part of this do people not understand?
It's not just about life, of course --  -- it's about healthy life, you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun.
So really, this is how I would like to describe it.
You know, these are arguments; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about.
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.
What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -- or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -- would actually live?
And thirdly, the question is, what will it do to actually how much people want it?
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.
So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging, we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another.
However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die, so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.
Nature's my muse and it's been my passion.
I went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth the way it was three billion years ago, back before the sky turned blue.
Meteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too.
circuit boards of the future.
And our brains -- our celebrated brains -- reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.
Life is a force in its own right. It is a new element.
And it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin.
But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again.
But that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again.
But it was really through teaching.
Scale is truly important.
It's because you can go to a manufacturer -- and I will leave the name out -- but we wanted a small display, doesn't have to have perfect color uniformity.
And I said, "God, our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell.
And we've been going steadily downhill.
Now, people ask all the time what it is.
That's what it is.
Well, you can't see it.
This artist's impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.
And it's this science, which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world, but also transforming our world faster than ever.
I don't go along with all that, but it's interesting that he had a simple solution.
So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.
This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life -- and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential -- is something that we look at a lot.
We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it, called "Thoughtless Acts?"
So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment to do all these different things.
This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
And for us, it's been great because it's won loads of design awards.
That adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of Canada.
Sometimes, we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big.
Sometimes, we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big.
Can't see it because it's too big.
Well, let's first look at the probability -- and this is very, very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years, which is surprising.
And even if you just look at the current people, and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct, it should still have a high priority.
Or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a great piece of art.
And it's really difficult to recall, in a normal frame of mind, just how good life can be at its best.
Or how bad it can be at its worst.
It's been done in voles.
We have no reason to believe that within this much, much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being, perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about.
The violin is made of a wood box and four metal strings.
I have another piece that I'd like to play for you.
So actually, if you listen carefully, there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.
So actually, if you listen carefully, there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.
The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model of the other, the quasar.
And according to that theory, it's already too late to avoid a disaster, because if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol, with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars, or whatever it is, then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.
If you've been punched on the nose, then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches.
And I've always been nervous about the term "futurist," because you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it.
And George Homsey, a great guy, said, "Oh, the future is amazing.
That's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans.
We could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way.
Each different color has a different magnetic polarity, and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out.
Each different color has a different magnetic polarity, and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out.
This is three minutes of UV light.
So you reverse this. This is a very old movie, so with the new prototypes, actually both surfaces are flexible, but this will show you the point.
This is something that my people at SQUID Labs are working on at the moment, called "electronic rope."
So literally, you think about a rope. It has very complex structure in the weave.
And under no load, it's one structure.
And under no load, it's one structure.
And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags, and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking, "Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up, I'm going to have a good time working here.
So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it.
And their inaugural exhibit was called "Happiness."

So government needs to make us do something painful to fix it.
And our military get quite unhappy with having to stand guard on pipelines in Far-off-istan when what they actually signed up for was to protect American citizens.
Well, saving that fuel, 69 percent of the fuel in light vehicles costs about 57 cents per saved gallon.
Or we could, of course, just get this little bit by continuing to import some Canadian and Mexican oil, or the ethanol the Brazilians would love to sell us.
But they'll sell it to Japan and China instead, because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers, and they don't.
Then there's an important military role.
I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving.
This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.
We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices.
But when I went to architecture school, it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family.
Many architects seemed to think that when you design, you design a jewel, and it's a jewel that you try and crave for; whereas I felt that when you design, you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing.
This is Kosovo in '99. We did an open design competition, like I said.
We went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue.
This is a kenaf clinic. You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land, and it grows 14 feet in a month.
And we picked nine finalists, and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region, and then the community picked their design.
This was a matchmaking, thanks to a couple of TEDsters -- Sun [Microsystems], Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli, who connected me with this amazing African woman.
And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world, but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down -- but there's a growing footprint that's happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate, and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy, I think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution,
And to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish, and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.
And I like the words, "in my world," because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it.
We see that the signal that's actually in the heart, we can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack even before they have symptoms so we can save their life.
And then, finally, a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation, which is the level which says you are having a heart attack.
We've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way.
It'll pick you up, and then we're going to call your doctor, tell him about it.
And when it hits the mid-brain, that's when the headache begins.
In the middle, our experimentalist, the neurologist, who said, "I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura."
Yousef Mohammed: In other words, we're treating electricity with electricity, rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays.
We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart.
We thought we could adapt it for the brain.
The advantages of responsive neurostimulation: It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur, provide stimulation only when needed, can be turned off if seizures disappear; it has minimal side effects -- as a matter of fact, in all our clinical trials to date, we've seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it's been implanted -- and it's invisible, cosmetically hidden, so, if you have epilepsy and you have the device,
The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator, called RNS, for Responsive NeuroStimulator -- that's a brilliant acronym -- for the treatment of other brain disorders.
The present portable device is far from optimally designed, both as to human factors as appearance.
Larry Brilliant: Smallpox was the worst disease in history.
It killed more people than all the wars in history.
Seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue: blindness, which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease.
Seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons of surveillance and epidemiology to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue: blindness, which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease.
The key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu is early detection and rapid response.
Then there'll be secondary outbreaks, and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you.
Within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world.
Now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone, maybe we should listen.
Most of them impossible, some of them impractical and one or two of them certainly immoral.
Bono: All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information, its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives, by connecting every hospital, health clinic and school in one African country.
Basically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years, we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS.
I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.
Let me just ask you, to start with, this simple question: who invented the mountain bike?
Because traditional economic theory would say, well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big R&D lab where they were thinking up new projects, and it came out of there. It didn't come from there.
Well this view, I think, is increasingly wrong.
And there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank, and when I was a kid, it was amazing, because the moon shots would take off, and this thing would move on rails.
I was worried about my own vagina.
In the first place, it's not so easy to even find your vagina.
Let's just start with the word "vagina" -- vagina, vagina.
"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina!"
Vagina, vagina, vagina. It doesn't matter how many times you say the word, it never sounds like a word you want to say.
It's a completely ridiculous, totally un-sexy word.
We were having a conversation about menopause, and we got onto the subject of her vagina, which you'll do if you're talking about menopause.
I don't know that that would have been my life ambition.
I think what I learned from talking about the vagina and speaking about the vagina, is it was the most obvious thing -- it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world -- and yet it was the one thing nobody talked about.
It has taken me, this journey, to Islamabad, where I have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off.
And it's been really interesting to be in my head for the last two days; I've been very disoriented --  because I think the world, the V-world, is very much in your body.
I met her three years ago in Kenya. And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl; she was circumcised against her will when she was 10 years old, and she really made a decision that she didn't want this practice to continue anymore in her community.
And he had shown up, obviously, in a form that it took me a long time to understand, which is that when we give in the world what we want the most, we heal the broken part inside each of us.
But what's even cooler is that if I have two fingers, I can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily.
Now, here's a simple application here -- I can draw out a curve.
So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity.
My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.
The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up.
We know three things about intelligence.
Remember that old chestnut?
She said, "She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was.
And you count the number of times until the pattern head-tail-head appears and you average them. OK?
That's what you might think.
Here's a little caricature of a million individuals.
So the chance that she's innocent isn't one in 73 million.

A lot of you have heard the term "memes." The evolution of technology, I pay a lot of attention to, so, you know, one of the first things you got was a little hand axe.
But there's a more fundamental reason that it's not intrinsically upbeat, because a non-zero-sum game, all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse.
But it's not a crazy concern, OK, because understanding behavior can lead to a kind of empathy, and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love, and so on.
I'm often asked, "What surprised you about the book?"
And I believe in a pluralistic society, everybody's betting on something.
And when I started the church, you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now.
This is not my planet.
And he said, "No."
But you may, you may.
Your worldview, though, does determine everything else in your life, because it determines your decisions; it determines your relationships; it determines your level of confidence.
My wife and I first made five decisions on what to do with the money.
Third thing is, I added up all that the church had paid me over the last 25 years, and I gave it back.
Your value is not based on your valuables.
So I had to say, ok, I would use whatever affluence and whatever influence I've got to help those who don't have either of those.
And then God says, "Pick it up."
And then God says, "Pick it up."
First, it represented his identity; he was a shepherd.
It's the symbol of his own occupation: I am a shepherd. It's a symbol of his identity, his career, his job.
So it's a symbol of his identity, and it's a symbol of his income.
And that basketball represents your identity, who you are: you're an NBA player. It represents your income: you're making a lot of money off that little ball.
In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky, some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.
And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.
The first is the critical price.
The first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price.
I'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD, which is a technology which has done all of these.
The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998, it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.
And it started to take off. And you can see that the units started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.
Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment, that was an inflection point that he could do something with.
The next phase it hit was displacement.
Start with gene sequencing.
There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.

In other cultures, time is cyclical.
It's seen as moving in great, unhurried circles.
Whereas in the West, time is linear.
It's a finite resource; it's always draining away.
Started in Italy, but has spread across the world, and now has 100,000 members in 50 countries.
Started in Italy, but has spread across the world, and now has 100,000 members in 50 countries.
Now, one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out, is the reaction to it.
I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near, or at least not as much as I did before.
And the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier, healthier, more productive than I ever have.
And we'll go off and have a conversation on that.
And, you know, built the society that we now live in.
One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint.
Like, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie "City of God?"
Here's a way of transporting water.
This is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw.
I will not run, but it's very important for me who is going to succeed me.
How much would that cost?
Here is where the problem is, and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside.
It permeates their entire life.
And it's used for communication.
SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar."
Narrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Panbanisha.
Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod, and these guys open up snails for a living.
So, I'll play it one more time.
And so the first question that came to mind was, well, how fast does this limb move?
I said, "Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system that could capture these movements, you guys can film us collecting the data."
It's a very beautiful structure.
So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists.
And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure, which results in the water literally vaporizing.
And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat, and it's a very destructive process.
So, one question I often get after this talk -- so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal?
So, one question I often get after this talk -- so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal?
So I'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations. First of all, I want to show you the particular illusion here. I want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other. These are all perceptual tricks. These are real objects that I'm going to show you. Now I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped
the film here so you can get a very interesting experience. I want you to see how this illusion is constructed, and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out. Now watch, as it rotates back, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now.
If you are a child under the age of 10 who haven't been ruined yet, you will look at this image and see dolphins. Now, some of you adults here are saying, "What dolphins? What dolphins?"
It's a static image. How many people see this illusion? It's completely static.
Okay, now getting to a part -- I want to show design in illusions. I believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So that when you saw from one little angle was like this. And this little technique got popular in the 16th century and the 17th century to disguise hidden meanings, where you could flip the image and
To make the story short, here is the coverage of the country.
We put this thing together.
But understand what you're looking at we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female, so that we could put it in any of these people.
Going to scratch his nose.
Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger.
We urgently need to change this.
Technology has moved forward.
It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness, and sense of human need.
It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity.
It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity.
I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism, specifically visual journalism, can bring into focus both the benefits and the cost of political policies.
It can give credit to sound decision-making, adding momentum to success.
In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction, it becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior.
And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.
It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.
Coming of age in those days made real the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital for a free and dynamic society to function properly.
Society's problems can't be solved until they're identified.
One of the things I had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger.
I'm a witness, and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored.
Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda.
We have a chance here to prove that a country that almost slaughtered itself out of existence can practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow and provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help.
All that being good and no real credit for it.
So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water, and after niceties, they said, "Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart?"
Hey! Well, we also believe that when you go to heaven, you get your body restored to you in its best original state.
So does this mean that if I went to heaven, I would get my old uterus back?" And they said, "Sure."
This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country, before the outbreak of war.
And very, very quickly -- I love puppets. Here's a puppet.
In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition, and lying on my mum's sofa, day in day out, watching daytime TV.
We got to Khatanga.
NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began.
: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
And only from the air did I see the big picture.
That's pretty much it.
I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin, from when I was 12 years old.
My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater -- at least I thought it was beautiful.
And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach, and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of right across the chest, that were also fuzzy.
And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach, and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of right across the chest, that were also fuzzy.
And I was so humiliated and mortified that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater.
But so, curious, I run up to the child -- of course scaring the living bejesus out of him -- grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater.
We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know.
We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know.
Today, three years later, the company has employed another thousand women.
It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.
If I change this, and take GDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the population.
Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD.
And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years, and we have produced animations.
And it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today.
The lesson we learn from this is: you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary.
The design is there in nature, but it's not in anybody's head.
Now, I talked to Paul afterwards -- I wanted to check to find out how he'd calculated this, and get the sources and so forth -- and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this.

There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which -- in that case -- A parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat.

The Arabic word "Islam" means "submission."
You've all got a copy, and you've just heard the man.
First of all, the goal -- and you heard just now what the goal is -- it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions, and he has succeeded.
That's really important.
Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.
Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.
Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I said about this book.
But then I read on, and I read this: "First, Noah had never seen rain, because prior to the Flood, God irrigated the earth from the ground up."
And here's one that does concern me.
I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends -- I do more, obviously, I also coach people -- but I'm into immersion, because how did you learn language?
And two: that hopefully we can not just understand other people more, but appreciate them more, and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today.
All of you have done this.
Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same!"
Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic.
Both right before the swap and five days later, people who are stuck with that picture, who have no choice, who can never change their mind, like it a lot!
So here's the final piece of this experiment.
We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say, "You know, we're doing a photography course, and we can do it one of two ways.
The beautiful thing is that it moves bodily. It's what's technically known as a "barchan," and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about 17 meters per year.
Bats, I've even suggested, use perceived hues, such as red and blue, as labels, internal labels, for some useful aspect of echoes -- perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces, furry or smooth and so on -- in the same way as swallows or indeed, we, use those perceived hues -- redness and blueness, etc. -- to label long and short wavelengths of light.
There's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength.
A marble statue could wave its hand at us; the atoms that make up its crystalline structure are all vibrating back and forth anyway.
But the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move the same way at the same time, and again and again.
We could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability, which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at.
I don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that, because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe.
Or worse, we seek revenge, in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge, which we see, of course, all over the world today.
Or worse, we seek revenge, in all probability thereby triggering the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge, which we see, of course, all over the world today.
The economically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful, goal-seeking agent with pleasures and pains, desires and intentions, guilt, blame-worthiness.
And they say this with an amazing confidence.
This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done.
That reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle, Suzanne R. -- he's off to the races.
Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks.
So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness.
And I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail, and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting.
I'll just give that to you one more time.
It's the same thing.
The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all.
Yes.
If you work on two neurons, that's psychology."
That's my only real aim in life.
And you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- detached from the instrument and from the stick, even though I'm actually holding the stick quite tightly.
And as a result -- once we got over a little hurdle, and having to audition twice -- they accepted me. And not only that -- what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom.
Maybe terrible over there, but not too bad there, etc., etc.
And you know, I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time.
So, heavens! What was I to do? I no longer required the sticks; I wasn't allowed to have these sticks.
I had to basically look at this particular drum, see how it was made, what these little lugs did, what the snares did.
I think we have a design problem.
There is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game.
We're adding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Now if we look at the word "competition," I'm sure most of you've used it.
And we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem, but the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge, we will never be able to recover that.
It's not a specific thing.
But electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.
You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.
Because, remember, the Web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network.
So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure -- I'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994, when it was growing 2,300 percent a year.
You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain.
I mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket.
So you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it.
And there are -- when you research this, there are gruesome descriptions of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices.
That splendid music, the coming-in music, "The Elephant March" from "Aida," is the music I've chosen for my funeral.
I'm a biologist, and the central theorem of our subject: the theory of design, Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.
In professional circles everywhere, it's of course universally accepted.
In non-professional circles outside America, it's largely ignored.
But that's putting it too negatively.
Complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve, and you can't solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex, thereby simply compounding the problem.
Darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity.
The God theory is not just a bad theory.
In my view, not only is science corrosive to religion; religion is corrosive to science.
It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations, and blinds them to the wonderful, real explanations that we have within our grasp.
As has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.
It's completely compatible with the God of the physicists.
People are always going on about, "How did September the 11th change you?"
So you're going to be able to go like this.
First of all, it needs to be small.
OK, one more time -- I'm just going to give you a little help.
Or is it Mena Trott?
So, I talked to Josh Prince-Ramus about the convention center and the conferences. It's getting awfully big.
This year, unfortunately the lakebed's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed.
So you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture, and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass.
And the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant.
It's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle.
Well, you see, it's not his. Yes -- he started it.
In the early days, we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand, you know, because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.
And we said, "Well, that doesn't sound so much fun.
And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.
It would be artificial intelligence.
And finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass."
And finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass."
A sense of place: your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings, and to employ the vocabularies, grammars, syntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecture in order to inform us who we are.
And consequently, we can see the result all around us.
The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically, but it has to inform us where we are in our culture.
Public space. This is a good public space.
It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined.
It is emphatically an outdoor public room.
It has something that is terribly important -- it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.
It has something that is terribly important -- it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.
That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations -- things go in and out of it. It's permeable.
This, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits of Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein, and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building, because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.
And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table with all the drawings, and the renderings, and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and -- I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there?  Because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting.
The pattern of Main Street USA -- in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.
They're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods; they're not supposed to be a set for "The Last of the Mohicans."
It becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country.
And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.
You can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever.
The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it, as well as wastewater.
And we're announcing a new product here tonight, which is the first time this has ever been shown in public.
It's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye, started by Nigel Jagger in London.
You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater -- of feeling like you're underwater -- seeing what's going on.
(Narrator: The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera.
It can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate, and is equipped with powerful lights.
It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep.
Maybe we'll learn something really useful about it, but it's interesting and fascinating.
But sometimes, a science has some other attributes which makes it really, really interesting.
It's just a bunch of cells. You understand your liver.
And now it's not that hard, you know, here's the apple, here's the orange, you know, the Earth goes around, that kind of stuff.
Finally, another thing is the answer was there all along, but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing, and that's the thing.
They say, well, we have a thing in a box, and we have its inputs and its outputs.
And here's how that happens. Let's start with a non-intelligent brain.
And the alligator has some very sophisticated senses.
It's got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on, a mouth and a nose. It has very complex behavior.
It can run and hide. It has fears and emotions. It can eat you, you know.
But we don't consider the alligator very intelligent, not like in a human sort of way.
The old brain is still there. You still have that alligator brain.
And so as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain, it also goes up into the neocortex. And the neocortex is just memorizing.
Oh, I've been here before. And when you've been here before, this happened next. It allows you to predict the future.
I have this thing called the altered door thought experiment.
Now I could change your doorknob in other ways.
I can make it larger or smaller, I can change its brass to silver, I could make it a lever. I can change your door, put colors on; I can put windows in. I can change a thousand things about your door, and in the two seconds you take to open your door, you're going to notice that something has changed.
What your brain is doing is making constant predictions all the time about what is going to happen in your environment.
As I put my hand on this table, I expect to feel it stop.
Every single moment. And finally, let's think about how we test intelligence.
First of all, we have to have the right framework.
You have to make these theories very realistic in anatomical terms.
You cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence.
It's an automatic playback. And prediction of future inputs is the desired output.
It's an automatic playback. And prediction of future inputs is the desired output.
And as I said, the theory must be biologically accurate, it must be testable, and you must be able to build it.
90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean, and it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.
This animal is in "The Guinness World Book of Records" for being the world's heaviest bony fish.
So the hardest part of tagging, now, is after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.
In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?
No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.
We put together a program that would, one: get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.
Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.
By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves due to proper management of our finances.
Nobody thinks there's opportunity.
She said, "I agree with everything that's been said.
So, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32.
I guess that's better living through bugs.
Alan Kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Energy's a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide.
So I said, "Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity," was all I could think of. What is virtue?
But of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion is that it is more fun.
I'm going to get up in the morning and think, what can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat, my pet, my butterfly?"
And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk.
And one of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to emphasize it and make it more important.
This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool.
What we want to do is mix in all types of data.
This was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes to be cleared into the disaster impact zone.
The freshness, the capacity. I can turn this image.
So three things have happened.
Although there is a sofa, if you watch in the kitchen, you can see that the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.
Let me first grade what are the most important means.
Money is not a goal.
Money is not a goal.
Sword swallowing is from ancient India.
And it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.
And a lot of people ask me, you know, what kind of people do you get for a project like this?
Along that same line, I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year, we have never seen monsters underground -- at least the kind that eat you.
Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light, it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.
How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?
There is a place where you can.
And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon.
This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.
I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it so we're not going to burn the gear.
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand.
Today, with diabetes, what do we do?
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.
I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.
If we can invent materials, design materials, or extract materials from a natural environment, then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.
Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh -- about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.
He asked the question, if I take that material, which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine, and I place it somewhere else on a person's body, would it give a tissue-specific response, or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?
That material contained only natural signals.
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.
But this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic.
And the first thing that I want to talk about, the first thing I think we need to understand is: how do people respond to the epidemic?
We're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign.
The final movement is called Mounds.
What makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.
The time capsule was available for one month online, translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.
So it starts out with zero ants, just the founding queen, and it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five.
Really the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation.
And that's the process that I call task allocation.
So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse.
They bring it back and feed it to the larvae.
They bring it back and feed it to the larvae.
They smell with their antennae.
But the idea is that the ants are in there, and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it -- a stream of contacts with other ants.
And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip, are contacting the ants coming in.
So, what's interesting about this system is that it's messy.
We didn't want to replay actual evolution with humans and all that, because it's almost more interesting to look at alternate possibilities in evolution.
OK, so here I've basically thrown together a little creature.
OK, so that's the complete model. Now we can actually go to the painting phase.
Now, at this phase, the program actually has some understanding of the topology of this creature. It kind of knows where the backbone is, where the spine, the limbs are.
And so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature.
Almost, again, like the Montessori toy idea.
But it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines, are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.
And it made me suspicious.
And then --  three paragraphs later we get this little beauty: "We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time.
The modern sector is the abode of the elites.
In many African countries the modern sector is lost.
And when they produce their crops, they sell the surplus on marketplaces.
It also means that he will be able to generate wealth.
I want to tell you a little story.
Aid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that.
WK: Yeah.
WK: Yeah. The windmill.
CA: And so, and that windmill, what -- it worked?
It all began with a fantastic phone call.
A satellite picture looking down at the earth.
Because in Africa today, we are competing globally for capital.
I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa that speaks to transformation.
I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa that speaks to transformation.
And so here was this lesson again -- leadership matters.
This year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves.
Her understanding that a student-crafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible.
I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well, so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda, and I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986, to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there.
And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language, and how what we call people so often distances us from them, and makes them little.
And, mostly because people never really ask you, and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.
I’d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa -- those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid.
But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.
If the government's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people, such a government is driven by self-interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion.
The problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in Africa.
Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.
How about this word?
Notice -- we're very specific -- that word "compile."
Because what a dictionary is, is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.
We have a pan that's too small!
So, you can't get a smaller ham.
You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries, but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.
You know, anybody who's read a children's book knows that love makes things real.
It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic, if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less about control and more about description, then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile.
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic, if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less about control and more about description, then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile.
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes, is touched, any time you touch a word, you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation, you verb it, you make the mobile move.
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes, is touched, any time you touch a word, you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation, you verb it, you make the mobile move.
They show the word, but they don't show any context.
They show the word, but they don't show any context.
Where did it come from? Who said it?
Not "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because, well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.
Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?
And the feet just step over the sand, and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in-between.
So 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel, we have a new wheel. I will show you, in the next video -- can you start it, please? -- that very heavy loads can be moved.
There's a guy pushing there, behind, but it can also walk on the wind very well.
This is working on the stored wind in the bottles.
It has a feeler, where it can feel obstacles and turn around.
So, they have to survive all the dangers of the beach, and one of the big dangers is the sea. This is the sea.
And it must feel the water of the sea.
So, imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea.
As soon as it touches the water -- you should hear a sound of running air.
Here we have the brain of the animal.
In fact, it is a step counter, and it counts the steps.
It's a binary step counter.
So as soon it has been to the sea, it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here.
And it always knows where it is on the beach. So it's very simple brain.
Here is an example from an op-ed on Thanksgiving, in the Boston Globe a couple of years ago, where the writer wrote, "The Indian life was a difficult one, but there were no employment problems, community harmony was strong, substance abuse unknown, crime nearly non-existent, what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter." Now, you're all familiar with this treacle.
So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory.
But anyone who looks at language realizes that this is a rather silly conceit, that language, rather, emerges from human minds interacting from one another.
The verb is the chassis of the sentence.
So, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere -- where you're doing something to the muffin -- you say, "Give the muffin to the mouse."
It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine which way it's tilting.
But this machine doesn't know what it looks like.
We were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil, spidery walk, but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward.
But when you look at that, you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward, nor did it have a model of itself.
It's an accelerated view, where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process.
It's an accelerated view, where you can see the robot actually carrying out some of its replication process.
And swat us away like flies, the way we swat away flies when we go into the rainforest and start logging it.
There's really a tree like that out there. That's really what it comes to.
You may of heard of it -- heard it called StarLink, especially when all those taco shells were taken out of the supermarkets about a year and a half ago.
And we know staph can do amazing things.
But it only has to get close, about a billion miles away, one of these things.
Nothing to worry about, right?
In a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years, but the labor was very long.
And you see me worried and trying to protect my child, because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child, even a minister.
It was not known in the fossil record, and we have it in this skeleton.
But I'm actually here today to tell a story.
And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David, and Davis Guggenheim, who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.
We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.
We premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.
My idea -- and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night, and we've all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep -- I was excited, with this phone call.
So, I'd like to show the clip of the film.
People will see my tag, and they'll see "The War Tapes," and then we'll start talking about war.
The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it.
Steve Pink reading his journal happened five months after he came home.
I was in Milan last week, for the Italian launch.
But looking way back, when I was a child -- you see, I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.
Thank you.
And as a child, I'd hear that song, you know, "Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain," so I made this amber waves image.
And I wrote this book, "The Laws of Simplicity."
It's a very short, simple book. There are ten laws and three keys.
And symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow.
We were fortunate, because in a way our building was future-proofed.
And unlike conventional buildings, the top of the building is celebratory.
And the base of the building is again about public space.
But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was we hired a car, looked up on Google, found a route into northern India from New Delhi which, you know, which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers, and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests, and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.
So the principal looks at it and says, 3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.
Is this real? Does the language matter, because he's not supposed to know English?
The last question is what everybody said, but you know, I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office, can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.
So what was the conclusion over the six years of work?
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic, fault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.
I wanted to -- well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago, we began using coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution, and 100 years ago, began getting gasoline from underground, with a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption, or production, will reach its limit in about ten years, and then go down, and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation.
This is more than 10,000 feet higher than the previous world's altitude record held by the SR-71 Blackbird.
PM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications, and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet.
Let's have the next video.
Let's have the next video.
And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.
Increasingly, I would say explosive growth of technology.
More reasons to be optimistic: in the '60s, and I am a creature of the '60s, there was a movement.
In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.
It is so significant that, in my mind, this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe, and sadly, that wasn't the case.
These are probably water ice pebbles, yes?
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.
I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn, because I had an apology to make to her.
And I went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why I had another woman's big, massive, big wedding ring on my finger.
RB: We couldn't find any customers.
How much -- what's the total revenue?
RB: I know, I have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but -- CA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about -- RB: "Pammy" we launched, you know -- mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola, and we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy" and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson.
I think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to, and Virgin Galactic up in the air.  So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship?
And it was like holding onto a thousand horses.
But, anyway, we managed to survive it.
RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that: just I love you very much. And I'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which -- just in case anything had happened.
We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be -- well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true.
I said, people should know about this book.
The problem is, we don't know the machine language of proteins or have a compiler for proteins.
One of my first questions doing this was: How can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA?
This has never made much sense to me, this argument.
It's very ingenious, as all Freudian arguments are --  -- but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion, a patient having the same delusion, about his pet poodle.
So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother, no problem.
One of the things we've found was, about half the patients with phantom limbs claim that they can move the phantom.
The phantom limb -- they'll say, "But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed.
It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful.
Why does this happen?
And he started giggling, he says, "I can see my phantom."
"And move your normal hand."
So he said OK, and he took it home.
I said, "Look, it's, after all, two dollars. Take it home."
I said, "What?"
It's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict.
And your motor command saying there is an arm, and, because of this conflict, the brain says, to hell with it, there is no phantom, there is no arm, right?
So, that's the bonus.
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin.
I'm going to answer that question.
It's never been answered before.
Where does choice come from?
Because of this, commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles, in narrow networks of people they know and trust.
The Chicago Board of Trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange.
In the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market.
But once it arrived, if no buyer was to be found, or if prices suddenly dropped, farmers would incur tremendous losses.
We could describe it using modern computer terminology as a kind of read-write culture.
It's a culture where people participate in the creation and the re-creation of their culture. In that sense, it's read-write.
The twentieth century was that century where, at least for those places we know the best, culture moved from this read-write to read-only existence.
Ordinary people live life against the law, and that's what I -- we are doing to our kids.
Whew! It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song.
And it's a made-up word.
So this is called "Tembererana."
And then, we fast-forward to about 1932, when three Italian psychiatrists, who were largely treating depression, began to notice among their patients, who were also epileptics, that if they had an epileptic -- a series of epileptic fits, a lot of them in a row -- the depression would very frequently lift.
It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics, but it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s that electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective in the treatment of depression.
And so the whole idea of electroconvulsive, electroshock therapy disappeared, but has had a renaissance in the last 10 years.
We had two more children after that.
And you can do them with phone kiosks.
And from a design perspective, it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people.
And this is where they take the stuff that breaks, and they fix it, and they put it back into circulation.
And what I mean by that is, as these become smaller, as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater -- things like banking, identity -- these things quite simply move very quickly around the world.
We like the ups and downs of life.
This is what I see from the balcony of my hermitage in the Himalayas.
But now, if it is something that is going to determine the quality of every instant of our life, then we better know what it is, have some clearer idea.
And probably, the fact that we don't know that is why, so often, although we seek happiness, it seems we turn our back to it.
If you are feeling very cold, you come near a fire, it's so wonderful.
After some moments, you just go a little back, and then it starts burning.
After some moments, you just go a little back, and then it starts burning.
It sort of uses itself as you experience it.
We think we could sit on the cloud, but if you go there, it's just mist.
We think of people suffering, of people we love, but at some point, it can be a state which is all pervading.
And the reason I'm saying this is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent.
What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating.
But when climate became, politically, a hot topic -- if I may make the pun -- in the last 15 years, this became so un-PC, we couldn't talk about it.
And I think it really summarizes where we are here.
That the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about, is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions -- but also, I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control, whether we like it or not.
So where's the link between these two things?
out of this stuff, that these things absorb sunlight, rot under pressure for millions of years, and you get these black rivers.
These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest trucks in the world are working here, and then you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to separate it, which only works at today's oil prices.
That's wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical.
You've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway.  There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff.
Wow.  Our research on the biomechanics of animal locomotion has allowed us to make a blueprint for a foot.
But it didn't even slow down the animal.
It's still running at the human equivalent of 300 miles per hour.
Look carefully: this is slowed down 100 times, and watch what it's doing with the rest of its leg.
But we know that art imitates life, and it turns out nature, three million years ago, evolved the next animal.
We biologically inspired this robot, named RHex, built by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years.
Watch where the robot, now, contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain.
What you'll see, in fact, is that it's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot.
Boy: Spiny.
Robert Full: It's spiny, right? It's really spiny, isn't it? It sort of hurts.
Dan Koditschek put some steel nails -- very simple version -- on the robot, and here's RHex, now, going over those steel -- those rails. No problem!
Let's slow it down and you can see the spines in action.
It's a secret. The animal effectively climbs by slipping and look -- and doing, actually, terribly, with respect to grabbing on the surface.
Here from underneath is an ant foot, and when the claws don't dig in, that pad automatically comes out without the ant doing anything.
And each hair has the worst case of split ends possible.
But it makes an incredible Band-Aid.
But it makes an incredible Band-Aid.
And here is RiSE.
And here are RiSE's first steps on an incline.
And here it is coming up at you, in its first steps up a wall.
I call that the cynical design.
Something like that. I am not sure of that.  Because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that.
But if you take a lens, like that, this line is ack, ack, ack, ack, ack. Like that.
With many, many, many, many face of barbaria.
And finally, all over Africa, you see this board game.
And finally, all over Africa, you see this board game.
So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology.
And the same divination system is found all over Africa.
And it turns out it's a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos.
We've also been working in design.
And finally, I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization, as we heard earlier, it's in the brain.
Raise your hand. Did your hand go up?
Would you each enter that on your calculator?
I brought with me a book of calendars.
We don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats.
There's a wonderful book called Stuff: The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects.
And it's well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia.
Actually, it's not about death.
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book, a soul-searching letter.
Your first pocketknife is like the first universal tool that you're given.
You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah.
So practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability.
Next time you're about to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out.
There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case, digital media.
There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case, digital media.
And it's perfectly legal.
Two tiny little boys.
Feminism is not dead, by no means.
Feminism is not dead, by no means.
It has evolved. If you don't like the term, change it, for Goddess' sake.
The woman's face looks like a watermelon.
Watch the skin color; watch the skin texture.
They think of somebody choosing fabrics.
It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency.
It's a suit for civil disobedience.
I've sent an email already to quite a few of you.
And into the slow, second movement, marked "adagio religioso," he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring; he was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part.
"Yes," he said. "That is what the Louvre said.
And what they were arguing about was this: whether the second Harry Potter movie was as good as the first.  Mr. Milliken said it was not. Dr. Robicsek disagreed.
So, from that fountain I built this building.
He said, "That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals for the Heinz company."
But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food.
He said, "No, sir. You're the gift.
When the Basie band came, the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights to the music.
That's the place all filled up with Republicans.
And I'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done.
And I said, "Herbie, this is my concept of a training center for poor people."
And she turned that audience around on a pin.
I was fascinated by this phenomenon, so I wondered: could one erase the image of Diana, actually quite crudely and physically?
So I created this image of Diana, Dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child and this image came out, which caused a huge public outcry at the time.
So, I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter.
I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day, and they were saying there's this great image of the Queen sitting outside William Hill.
When you take the logo off, you're opening up the interpretations and making the work inconclusive, opposed to conclusive when you are advertising.
It's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly, and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery.
The date was February 2000.
I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law -- ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever.
Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing.
Truth, curiosity, diversity, no selling, no corporate bullshit, no bandwagoning, no platforms.
And the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology.
We need to put this better market feedback.
So, I want to move now to the second part of my story, which is: when are we going to start doing this congestion pricing? Road pricing is coming.
They mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals.
In the mornings it is terrible, and the afternoon is worst.
During many years, I made some speeches starting with this saying: "City is not a problem, it's a solution."
It's a simple idea about nature.
And that tool is very simply, as Chris suggested, looking at us and the world from the plants' or the animals' point of view.
I was here, planting my chunks, cutting up potatoes and planting it, and the bees were working on this tree; bumblebees, just making this thing vibrate.
And when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right?
And you will see, the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we've decided ethanol is going to help us.
Well, look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...
Well, look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...
This is how soil is created.
And again, we have no way of knowing, but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged.
Twenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma as a probe of the biological question: if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors, how does cooperation exist at all?
He started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered, much to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won -- it won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won, it won the second tournament -- that's known as tit for tat.
The other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons.
We've seen that ThinkCycle has enabled NGOs in developing countries to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world, including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now: it's a mechanism for rehydrating cholera victims that's so simple to use it, illiterates can be trained to use it.
In order to be secure, you defend against "them."
That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line, and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt, and were willing to be attacked and criticized.
That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line, and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt, and were willing to be attacked and criticized.
I think what I'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security, and if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people, but you make yourself far more insecure.
Real security is hungering for connection rather than power.
It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs.
And ... Well, I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theremin.
And there'd be that sound in the signal -- it's like  -- and he thought, "Oh, what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument, because there are pitches in it."
And so somehow through developing that, he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now.
And when there were complaints about budget, I said, "Well, it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money: reflections."
Well, they said, "People won't understand, they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that."
We are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people; we're about to embark on that.
But one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site.
And that was a lot of heat to deal with.
So put that library at the bottom of that ship -- that's how big the thing was going to be.
NASA had no interest; they tried to kill the project.
NASA had no interest; they tried to kill the project.
This is the really secret stuff: how to get directed energy explosions.
They built a high-explosive propelled model.
Do you guys know about that movie "The Secret"?
It makes "The DaVinci Code" seem like "War and Peace."
DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top.
So, Microsoft -- this is a project that -- WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray, who's our colleague, and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible.
And so WorldWide Telescope will be available this spring.
I certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then, if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion.
So they're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up.
So what if I click this down to zero?
It goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine-year-olds.
And it's interesting.
AK: So obviously, Aristotle never asked a child about this particular point because, of course, he didn't bother doing the experiment, and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas.
So this is a real human brain.
Our right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies.
On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye.
I do not understand numbers, I do not understand the telephone, but it's the only plan I have.
So I take the phone pad and I put it right here.
It was a dialog with the context again.
But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant.
And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker.
And, finally, Jay dragged me to my hometown, Toronto, Canada.
And there is a story -- it's a real story -- about my grandmother buying a carp on Thursday, bringing it home, putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid.
I played with it in the evening.
And that chain link is really expensive.
And it was this interaction between that kind of, up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting.
There were plenty of models for that, in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and many artists who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials.
I don't want the tower."
The detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building.
I flew in one night and took this picture.
That big metal thing is a passage, and in it is -- you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom, which is on the right.
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it.
It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply -- it's that formed lumber from Finland.
It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply -- it's that formed lumber from Finland.
We used it at Loyola on the chapel, and it didn't work.
And this would be a hotel.
And following that basic idea of the village, we changed it as we got into it.
The material is lead copper, like in the building in Boston.
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment, and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons.
And so it will be quite a different shape.
And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel, non-fire proof, much like those old gas tanks.
He designed the robot as the cashier, and the head moves, and I did the rest of it.
It should have been the other way around -- the food should have been good first.
And, admittedly, it's in a very shorthand notation.
And she's right. It's a question we've all been avoiding.
It involves gravitational waves.
So we bought a derelict hotel near Cape Town.
The area was kind of seedy, so we got an 80-room hotel for 100,000 dollars.
The area was kind of seedy, so we got an 80-room hotel for 100,000 dollars.
I will be attending AIMS.
AIMS is now a proven model.
And at the same time, I thought about this massive group of people I knew: writers, editors, journalists, graduate students, assistant professors, you name it.
You give those hours in the afternoon to the students in the neighborhood.
And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell, but we did all the necessary research.
It used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below, acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.
You see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin.
So then you have the villain containment unit, where kids put their parents. You have the office.
So, this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco, they did this phenomenal job.
"I believe:" it did not mean, "I accept certain creedal articles of faith."
And religion, with its wide following ... Here in the United States, people may be being religious in a different way, as a report has just shown -- but they still want to be religious. It's only Western Europe that has retained its secularism, which is now beginning to look rather endearingly old-fashioned.
The Greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people.
The importance of this is that this is -- I can see some of you starting to look worried, because you think it's a slow and cumbersome body -- but what the United Nations can do is give us some neutrality, so that this isn't seen as a Western or a Christian initiative, but that it's coming, as it were, from the United Nations, from the world -- who would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this.

And if we now compare the face of the statue, with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.
Ladies and gentlemen, this story has not yet been published.
People envision this as being very difficult.
I've got a frequency counter right here.
From here to here is the wavelength of sound.
So, music videos are something that I always found interesting, but they always seem to be so reactive.
So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation following it?
So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation following it?
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years.
This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high.
This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high.
I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap.
It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this: the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions, all has a single, very simple solution.
are up to 780 -- and I thought I saw one go by there, just to localize this -- which is good news.
And they actually use the Nintendo Wii Remote.

The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal. It means a lot to us.
Great idea, but it doesn't work at all.
So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.
What are all the possible ways that we can think of to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience, not just listening, but making music?
And that led to something which you probably do know.
Guitar Hero came out of our lab, and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface, people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music, and playing it over and over and over again.
So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg, because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero.
Music can change your life, more than almost anything.
It can change the way you communicate with others, it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero.
So, one of the growing fields that we're working on at the Media Lab right now is music, mind and health.
A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called "Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book.

Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes, movement to people with Parkinson's disease.
It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms, but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.
It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms, but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.
I think that's true for many of us, and I want to give you two examples of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have, from ourselves to the outside world.
The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera, one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now.
And the opera is about what we can share, what we can pass on to others, to the people we love, and what we can't.
So we started developing a technology that will allow him with nuance, with precision, with control, and despite his physical disability, to be able to do that, to be able to perform his piece of music.
I think it gives an understanding of how we're picking out movement from what Dan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement, that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise, very disciplined and they're also very beautiful.
Now, the term "information society," "information economy," for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial revolution. But in fact, for purposes of understanding what's happening today, that's wrong. Because for 150 years, we've had an information economy.
If in 1999 I told you, let's build a data storage and retrieval system.
It's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world.
If you leave a $50 check after dinner with friends, you don't increase the probability of being invited back.
You have to hire them to spend a lot of time.
Five minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun.
So, a new social phenomenon is emerging.
So, a new social phenomenon is emerging.
How does the news shape the way we see the world?
It's been proved: self-care is cost-effective.
All the units, all the centers, are linked through a switched hub to a central server, and all the images are populated to review stations.
And, if they went to Miami, they will spend significantly more -- eight to 10 times more. And they feel happy spending it at home, getting the same quality of care.
And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.
And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.
So I remained with them, and the more I wrote that story, the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me -- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real, and that is where I'm gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.

Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly, as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.
The book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.
The book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.
So, there are never complete answers.
That is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down, Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason we don't yet see.
Now, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea, sometimes that's all it is -- bold and bizarre, but it has nothing to do with the world around us.
Now, this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations.
We don't seem to see them.
So, imagine you're looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light.
Now that's an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see.
But what about the second question that I asked: does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world?
In detail, for instance, they couldn't get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory.
Until something wonderful happened in our age.
In our era, a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself, many others around the world, it's called superstring theory, as you were indicating.
So if these ideas are correct, this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like.
Now here is the catch.
When you study the mathematics of string theory, you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space.
It doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six.
And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns, we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers.
Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other, so there's a head-on collision.
And actually, this morning, I got an email saying that we've just finished, today, building the last piece of ATLAS.
Now, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that, but that seems to be the case.
All this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things -- human brains -- are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe.
It's almost like ...
It's almost like ...
So it's in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of.
I want to know what this Higgs particle does."
And we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.
The analogy is that these people in a room are the Higgs particles.
If that picture's true, then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.
Now there's a theory called super-symmetry, which doubles the number of particles in the standard model, which, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.
But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.
The story goes like this: we know that the universe began 13.7 billion years ago, in an immensely hot, dense state, much smaller than a single atom.
After about a few minutes, there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all.
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen, 25 percent helium. It still is today.
This is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth which imitates another creature which imitates yet another creature.
♫ Everyone is crying at the dread hypnotic flying ♫ ♫ of the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫ ♫ You can't walk, you can't ramble ♫ ♫ 'cause you're gonna have to scramble ♫ ♫ from the bee of the bird of the moth. ♫ ♫ Catbird is a cat ♫ ♫ but he's got bugness in his veins. ♫ ♫ Manhouse lives within himself ♫ ♫ with thoughtful human brains. ♫

Now, I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids, but if you do, please trust me, it's the most pressure you can put on a child, to say --  -- we trust you that you will always do the right thing.
This is really a business venture, one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market.
It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same.
What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world, the government plays a key role in the development of technology.
In other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place.
But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be, one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life.
We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year, and we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education.
This is photomicrographs from Nick Read and Patrick Hickey.
We exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium.
The mycelium is sentient.
It knows that you are there.
How is it that this organism can be so large, and yet be one cell wall thick, whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us?
So, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil, and then, when we returned six weeks later, all the tarps were removed, all the other piles were dead, dark and stinky.
And I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish, I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants were making debris fields, every day, in my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium, because there's no spores.
I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one.
It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.
I want to reinvent the delivery system, and the use of cardboard around the world, so they become ecological footprints.
And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music -- I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover with the MIT Media Lab -- it relates a lot to music.
Well, that's what juggling is about, right?
It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.
Time. How can you look at time?
The only other thing is, it was a real shock.
So, if you want to go with the music for cylinders.
This is a vending machine for crows.
They figure it's gotta have more to it.
Margarine didn't exist.
Thus arrived convenience.
This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.
Instead they were sold on yogurt, yogurt being almost as good as broccoli.
It is not a map.
So we went to the moon, played golf up there, before we went to the largest feature on our own planet.
Because it's along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating.
We discovered a profusion of life, in a world that it should not exist [in]. Giant tube worms, 10 feet tall.
We did not know about this life system.
It contains more history than all of the museums on land combined.
But we have no idea what we're going find when we go out there with our technology.
You win or lose an engineer or a scientist by eighth grade.
And when you get a jaw drop, you can inform.
And I wanted to really not just work on the skins, but I wanted to work on the entire human experience.
So, the light bulb actually does that.
This is called Y Water, and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt, Austrian originally, who came to us, and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink, or an organic drink for his kids, to replace the high-sugar-content sodas that he's trying to get them away from.
I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.
And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key --  -- and the Num Lock key, too.
They fought the suppliers, they fought the manufacturers.
So, the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible.
Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.
Now, this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting.
Now, this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting.
Since I'm always liking to solve problems, I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction, and solving all of the mechanical problems for getting this little man to walk back and forth.
You know, they say, never play with your food -- but I always play with things.
But then I make the machine, which is sort of the stand-in for me, and it is able to achieve the action that I want.
The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought, and it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair."
But when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind.
It would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.
The object itself just means nothing.
The object itself just means nothing.
You remember all that oil?
If there's something that is copied with variation and it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere.
Remember that, that's the core definition: that which is imitated.
Remember that, that's the core definition: that which is imitated.
A meme is not equivalent to an idea.
So, let's see some memes.
It's a really expensive organ to run.
Why? Because it's producing the memes.
Now, it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off, and maybe it nearly did, but you see, we don't know.
Will it be taken?
A company flies in, does a deal with a minister.
The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury -- that is, the British Treasury.
They worked out they were worth two billion pounds.
And unfortunately, I can be a little too honest.
And I could sense that she thought I was speaking synecdochically.
So, this device here is an invisibility cloak.
In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived, had much higher CO2 than today, was much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points for the effects of CO2 on climate.
The only question is, what was in the juice?
So I want to begin with this wonderful illusion by [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher.
One, the world is, was, will always be filled with good and evil, because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition.
So the Lucifer effect, although it focuses on the negatives -- the negatives that people can become, not the negatives that people are -- leads me to a psychological definition. Evil is the exercise of power.
My recent book, "The Lucifer Effect," is about, how do you understand how good people turn evil?
So, he saw this art not as hunting magic, but as postcards of nostalgia.
Values that maintain the proposition that their prayers, and their prayers alone, maintain the cosmic balance.
You put the stick in the powder to take the sacred ashes -- well, they're not ashes, they're burnt limestone -- to empower the coca leaf, to change the pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption of cocaine hydrochloride.
A people for whom blood on ice is not a sign of death, but an affirmation of life.
The world remains a rich tapestry.
Web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization.
Such a computer would open up universes, which are, at the present, outside the range of any instruments.
He had a wonderful rapport.
"Dr. Barricelli claims machine is wrong, code is right."
And he went around the country after that.
And we owe a tremendous credit to that.
That's the last entry in the logbook when the machine was shut down, July 1958.
And so, this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes.
And today, 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking.
I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation.
And the constraints in building any organism, when you look at it, are really severe. Natural technologies have incredible constraints.
You need to discover the general principles of nature, and then use these analogies when they're advantageous.
Now, why is this important to have this model?
Now, why is this important to have this model?
Now, why is this important to have this model?
Because it's very interesting. When you take this model and you perturb it, you give it a push, as it bumps into something, it self-stabilizes, with no brain or no reflexes, just by the structure alone.
For example, here's a leg: the clear part is stiff, the white part is compliant, and you don't need any axles there or anything.
The animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down!
It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all.
It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all.
It has six legs -- there are the tuned, springy legs.
Here's RHex entering the woods.
Again, this robot can't see anything, it can't feel anything, it has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system, with very simple parts, but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal.
How do they do this? They have bizarre toes. They have toes that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out, and then peel off the surface, like tape.
Let's see some of the geckos move with some video, and then I'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots.
Now, I want you to look at the animal's back.
If you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to Berkeley, come to my lab and we'll figure this out. Okay, send them to Berkeley because that's the next thing I want to do. Here's the gecko mill.
See it uncurl and then peel these toes.
How do they do it then? Believe it or not, they grab on by intermolecular forces, by Van der Waals forces.
We also presented to Nike even.
The ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side.
Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong.
And rather than go into statistics and trends, and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing, and the record companies that are folding, I thought we should do an experiment tonight.
Actually, it's not really an experiment, because I know the outcome.
You might hear it like second-hand smoke at the airport ...
So nobody is tone-deaf.
That's excitement, don't worry about it.
I tell my students, "If you have a deceptive cadence, raise your eyebrows, and everybody will know."
Now, that is something.
How would you walk? How would you talk? How would you be?
Never shown this picture before, and probably going to be sued for it.
It's taken at three o'clock in the morning, without the permission of the company.
We all need help, even those of us who are very seasoned.
Kids don't program enough and boy, if there's anything I hope this brings back, it's programming to kids.
Dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic.
He did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us, nothing specific about sunlight-readable, mesh-network, low-power, but just a vanilla laptop proposal.
He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ...
But if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window.
But if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window.

♫ Feminists don't have a sense of humor. ♫ ♫ Feminists just want to be alone -- boo hoo, hoo, hoo. ♫ ♫ Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors. ♫ ♫ They have a tumor on their funny bone. ♫ ♫ They say child molestation isn't funny -- ha, ha, ha, ha. ♫ ♫ Rape and degradation's just a crime -- lighten up, ladies. ♫ ♫ Rampant prostitution's sex for money -- what’s wrong with that? ♫
The first night we'd gotten a room for the kids right next to us.
And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record, which I still stand by, but this has got something else in it.
I stay. If I go, I will be killed.
And what of important things -- I think all of you here have a cell phone.
And what of important things -- I think all of you here have a cell phone.
I housed that 4,000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University.
The second war came while we didn't expect it.
I had only this equipment -- my satellite phone, my computer and a plastic solar panel -- that I hide it in the forest.
When I was thinking to come here, what best title I wanted to say to my talk, I didn't find this.
What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk.
That stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen.
So, it's subject to gravity, has joints, etc.
If you just run the simulation, it will just collapse, like this.
So, what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped that's learning how to walk using artificial evolution.
Now, after five generations of applying evolutionary process, the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better.
Generation 10 and it'll take a few steps more -- still not quite there.
That was the real breakthrough for us.
And what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle.
Now, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right, which is what I'm doing now, here, it will fall over it in a completely different way.
We hired a team of physicists, software engineers and biologists to work on this, and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body, basically.
We hired a team of physicists, software engineers and biologists to work on this, and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body, basically.
It's got to be relatively fast, so you can run it on a normal machine, but it's got to be accurate enough, so it looks good enough, basically.
Nothing really interesting, basically.
So, this character now has motor skills in the upper body -- nothing in the legs yet, in this particular one.
So, this character now has motor skills in the upper body -- nothing in the legs yet, in this particular one.
But what it will do -- I'm going to push it again.
It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed.
So here, we've got the same character.
What this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now.
And you see it falls differently.
So that you don't have a character that looks limp, but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away, that looks kind of alive in midair as well.
And let's just have a look at a slightly different visualization.
But this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month, and more than that, you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.
If you're ever in Kentucky, there's, you can see a movie of the flood, and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.
And that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore.
But that's hard to do. Unfortunately, the ice is thick.
You'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which, in what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud -- these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets when they fall close to the Sun. Mostly, they just live out there in the cold of the outer solar system, but they are biologically very interesting indeed, because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals, which are just the right ones for developing life.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa, and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years.
It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface, just as it did on the Earth.
Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years, finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great -- much greater freedom, and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean.
And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy, but it happened.
But better -- what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight.
In order to concentrate sunlight, they have to have lenses and mirrors -- in order to keep themselves warm.
But still, it's a good chance. And of course, if it happens, it will transform our view of life altogether.
You still are on a piece of ice, you can still have sunlight and you can still survive while you're traveling from one place to another.
What's going to happen in the end, it's not going to be just humans colonizing space, it's going to be life moving out from the Earth, moving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life, of course, is going to be the universe. And if life is already there, it makes it much more exciting, in the short run.
But in the long run, if there's no life there, we create it ourselves.
In the jungles of Guatemala, in Tikal, stands a temple.
Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies.
We found activity in a tiny, little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area.
But romantic love is much more than a cocaine high -- at least you come down from cocaine.
Somebody is camping in your head.
As a matter of fact, Lucy and I have a little joke about this.
You focus on the person, you obsessively think about them, you crave them, you distort reality, your willingness to take enormous risks to win this person.
So, I will close with this. These are my older people.
This is intimacy to women.
So my final statement is: love is in us.
The problem is not technology.
And I said, "The greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life.
Thank you for the privilege. It was great.
Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic dealing with psychological and mind-reading effects.
KT: Yes.
KB: No way to see through it? KT: No.
If, for instance, I didn't want you to look at my right hand, then I don't look at it.
OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you, I'm merely placing you in a heightened state of synchronicity, so our minds are along the same lines.
And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind, I'm going to take your left hand, and just place it up here.
I want you to allow your hand to stick firmly to the tabletop.
Excellent. Now that you've got the idea, let's try something even more interesting.
Now, have a look at the Coke bottle.
Make sure it is solid, there's only one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle.
And you can whack it against the table, if you want; be careful.
I'm trying to be good here.
There's a K in his name, there is a K.
Actually, Chris, I was going to pick you for this, but instead of picking you, can you hop up here and pick a victim for this next experiment?
Now, Steve, look back.
"Not good enough." And that's what I'm going to be talking about.
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness.
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage.
It should be interested in the best things in life.
So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them.
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about, about flow. And it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way.
This is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally.
We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.
Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS.
When we then find something very important, like the bones of a human ancestor, we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly, using dental picks and fine paintbrushes.
When we then find something very important, like the bones of a human ancestor, we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly, using dental picks and fine paintbrushes.
Well, an excavation was begun immediately, and more and more little bits of skull started to be extracted from the sediment.
And that water that you see there is the open lead, and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.
And that water that you see there is the open lead, and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.
They have colors. What do they look like?
You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here.
But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us.
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.
The computer then talks to a machine -- a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine -- that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice, because the computer is just a machine.
It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts.
It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.
So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.
It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.
It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks.
Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations, this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center, replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street, that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.
Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night.
Every single surface of this restaurant is white.
Let's see it one more time.
But if that's happened in the last 5,000 days, what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?
And it turned out that this machine happens to be the most reliable machine that we've ever made.
So it's a very big number.
First, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying.
And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.
And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web.
So, I don't know what the name of this thing is.
The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town, and that it's a specific town that I live in, but that's what we're going to be talking about.
Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are and all your friends are.
A semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph -- we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.
We are going to be the machine.
Just like it wasn't TV and only better.
The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web but only better -- it's going to be something different.
And I think it's going to be smarter.
It'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.
But it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.
Secondly, it's become much more personalized.
So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you is that we have to begin to think about this as not just "the Web, only better," but a new kind of stage in this development.
It looks more global. If you take this whole thing, it is a very big machine, very reliable machine, more reliable than its parts.
But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.
But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.
So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system, more as if this wasn't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with. It's a "One."
But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge.
All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web.
So, this clip is from the PBS series, "The Secret Life of the Brain."
Now, this pore can open and close.
But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady -- it's a sporadic flow of current.
These are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in.
And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel.
What you have here is a system where you store data locally.
Instead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms, we went and talked to neurobiologists who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina.
The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.
It extracts regions with dark contrast, which will show up on the video as red.
This is Kareem's dark eyes and that's the white background that you see here.
And that is what origami used to be.
But it's become something else.
It's become an art form, a form of sculpture.
The common theme -- what makes it origami -- is folding is how we create the form.
The secret to productivity in so many fields -- and in origami -- is letting dead people do your work for you.
And I can put it in this simple equation.
And you might say, "Can you really be that specific?
So let me stretch out that equation.
How would you make a single flap?
How would you make a single flap?
There's other ways of making flaps.
If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.
And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.
But computers -- you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms, and with this, we could.
So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.
It's free. It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.
And you just draw a stick figure, and it calculates the crease pattern.
He studied a folding pattern, and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure.
The telescope, going up in space, it unfolds in two places.
Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger.
There were two groups of people who were interested in this: planetary scientists, who want to look up, and then other people, who wanted to look down.
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?
This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You at Oxford University.
This must be who I'm directly descended from."
And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.
And the whole thing, if you add it all together, is over six billion nucleotides long.
If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body, and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.
And you're working away until late at night, and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee and you're paying attention, but, occasionally, when you're copying this by hand, you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake -- substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.
The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.
So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours, you'll get to see what a real savannah is like.
The project launched in April 2005.
Pygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson.
But this flashbulb memory, as it's called, is when all the elements came together to define not just the event, but my emotional connection to it.
So, this represents -- this is a cross-sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists, working at the very top of their craft -- except one.
This is actually one of the rangers.
This is actually one of the rangers.
James Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED, took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.
And finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis, they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre-war lives.
Because, as I'll explain to you, the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected.
So what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars, that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.
When those measurements are made, instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant, as a function of distance.
In fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.
It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.
I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK, to try to remind you that it's there.
How do we see that galaxy?
Now, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?
It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.
So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass, I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.
Now, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well, is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.
So the expansion slows down with time.
They can come through the building, through the Earth -- they're so non-interacting.
So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators have built such a detector.
So, this deck is bought here. Sorry.
The thing I did -- I peeked.
LG: Ten of diamonds, yeah.
And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction.
And they take this stuff seriously.
He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know, wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something, and take him a little message that says, "Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner."
So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.
And this, to me, is always what training is.
I bet a lot of you do, right?
You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.
It doesn't have to be.
There's several definitions of what a punishment is, but one definition, the most popular, is: a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior, such that it's less likely to occur in the future.
It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.
And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital, plus the brother-in-law, plus the child.
And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital, plus the brother-in-law, plus the child.
It's not a good dog you shout at.
You know, kind of like a little robot.
And it then starts, and we get into this thing, and our personal feedback -- there's two things about it.
When you watch people interacting with animals or other people, there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.
You see it's especially in families, especially with spouses, especially with children, especially with parents.
All you've got to do is to watch them, to time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes, you ask the question, "Is it good, or is it bad?"
He wrote some early pieces, but late in his life, in his mature period, he said, "Here's a theme -- 30 variations."
Audio has come very late to this game -- I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering.
Audio has come very late to this game -- I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering.
So this is a computer program.
A small mutation can take a two-wing fly and make it a four-wing fly.
You're going to design something like a cell phone, and in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone.
Then you're going to have a compiler that's going to take that description and it's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed.
We add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples.
It's got a needle, like a record needle, that goes back and forth over the surface, bumps up and down, and feels the height of the first surface.
We're going to turn to another technology, called algorithmic self-assembly of tiles.
So, what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going.
It knows when to stop growing because it can count.
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 10, 11, 12, 17.
A little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff, 99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air.
It's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun are spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth.
What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception, right, in their heads, of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children?
And you've all got an idea in your head of the answer.
For the first time ever, we have enough wealth concentrated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow us to really drive space exploration.
And you know, when you give to a nonprofit, you might have 50 cents on the dollar.
So, we have actually -- are looking to turn the X PRIZE into a world-class prize institute.
This is what happens when you put up a prize, when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials.
So, prizes work great.
The rocket's position is shown by the trajectory that we're now looking at.
We're threatened by the greatest weapon ever, and knowing a good thing when it sees it, the Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us.
This had the first pointing device. It was distributed, so it worked out -- distributed computing and modems -- so all these things could talk to each other.
About 20 percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing, and it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes.
This proprietary principle of vendor lock-in would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere.
But all that was about to change.
We asked a question about how the mind works, and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant.
Yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology, the Digital Superhighway.
Thomas Edison had the same problem.
They think of the old medium, because the old medium is always the content of the new medium, as movies tend to be the content of TV, and as books used to be the content, novels used to be the content of movies.
Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature, have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.
How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?
Because if our goal is to understand the world, to seek a deeper understanding of the world, our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder.
Because when people all share values, when people all share morals, they become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams, it shuts down open-minded thinking.
Let's start at the beginning.
But as my son, Max, grows up in a liberal college town, how is this first draft going to get revised?
Moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity.
And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on, cooperation shoots up.
This guy's shirt says, "Stop bitching, start a revolution."
The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve.
Think about the Dalai Lama.
But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth.
The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places, than it is in the rainforests.
Here's a jelly.
This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.
I love that kind of stuff.
It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.
It's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.
One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world -- this world, this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory.
Because we see it in bits and pieces right now.
This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth.
You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean, and it's coming out all from it.
So by 1985 -- each of those red bombs up here is equivalent of a thousands warheads -- the world had 65,000 nuclear warheads, and seven members of something that came to be known as the "nuclear club."
Chapter one is 1949 to 1991, when the Soviet Union broke up, and what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years, was a superpowers' nuclear arms race.
When the Soviet Union broke up, we effectively lost that adversary as a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part.
The suitcase can be conveniently dropped in your trunk of your car.
This is the size of the "Little Boy" bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima.
This is the size of the "Little Boy" bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima.
My point now, though, is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here, if you've survived the initial blast.
In that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do -- and I mean this seriously -- is go about a mile away from the blast.
The hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world.
I want you to inspect its mouth, look at its teeth.
Now, I'm not a chemist, but basically what happens is the fat is oxidized by their breathing.
I'm going to show you another film.
So if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we?
Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world is the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.
Yes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions, but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online.
If you give something to a charity or to the public, you get a pat on the back and a tax donation -- except on the Net, where you can go broke.
If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one, which is probably best known for burning, is, don't just have one copy.
And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.
so we're hedging our bets here.
I said, "I have to talk to them about stories.
Have you been watching the commercials?

How do we really change children's relationship to food?
And the very first thing was about regional food -- trying to eat food from within our region.
In our school district, the way we afford this is our school district allocates .03 percent of the general fund towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district allocated a half to one percent, we could start to really fix this program.
I do now, after learning about all the quantum stuff.
And there he is, a little bush baby on -- caught in the headlights there.
And then I started another company.
They're incredibly complex. They can't -- I have no idea of how they work.
So if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth, let's start with that. And since I got that idea, I've had to shake hundreds of hands.
You've got to convey passion.
I want you to say -- or I want you to convey -- that you are going to die if you have to, with your very last breath, your fingernails scratching as they draw you out.
And you have to have rational projections.
And it goes from beginning to end.
Just give me your company logo.
Now, this is not a product pitch or sales pitch.
Now, given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question, why should it have been such an appealing notion?
And needless to say, there were certain risks in taking on these subjects.
And I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence that this supposed decline in the elite arts and criticism occurred in the same point in history in which there was a widespread denial of human nature.
A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf, and there's some debate as to what she actually meant by that.
You can deploy power in a wide range of ways.
And as a result of this convergence, this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together, there's a real possibility that, instead of a clash of Islamic civilization -- if there is such a thing -- and democratic civilization -- if there is such a thing -- we'll in fact have close compatibility.
You face the circumstances you have in front of you and you go forward.
Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes.
Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles, 35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure.
So, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure.
Unlike entering any normal space, entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium.
And, you know, we thought -- well, we tried to convince them.
And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know, it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of.
So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking -- I mean that's its primary objective, both its program and its architectural conceit.
So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking -- I mean that's its primary objective, both its program and its architectural conceit.
And for the purposes of this talk, I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects, and it happens to be our current obsession, and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction.
And I understood that documentary photography has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.
[ 10.3.08 -- The story breaks. ] [ "I have been a witness, and these pictures are my testimony." ] [ South Africa ] [ This is happening now. ] [ Cambodia ] [ Swaziland ] [ One person dies every 20 seconds. ] [ Thailand ] [ An ancient disease is taking on a deadly new form. ] [ Siberia ] [ Lesotho ] [ Tuberculosis: the next pandemic? ]
Also around this time, at home, this was the computer that people were buying.
And in that amount of memory someone programmed a full flight simulation program.
The video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.
It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer, making the publisher about another 275 million.
Now, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago here just to show how video game graphics have been improving.
I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it.
And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about.
DP: Wow.
I live right there in the West Village, so the plume was luckily blowing west, away from us.
But nothing really says this model of interactivity -- which was so exciting and captures the real, the Web Zeitgeist of 1995 -- than "Click here for a picture of my dog."
And you can get a list.
So when I was talking in "Emergence," I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture that, basically, you could link to somebody else but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them.
Now what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger, where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web -- there's nothing artificial.
He had a huge ambition.
And that worthy ambition became his lodestar.
And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure, that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then.
And yet, years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies.
And as Lincoln told the story, Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war.
And then came my second sin.
These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption, or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential.
And we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11, we fail to solve the 12th -- we're in trouble. For example, if we solve our problems of water and soil and population, but don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble.
But this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview.
And it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.
And it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.
This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky -- a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity, when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.
You don't think; it goes automatically, if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.
The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works.
In this setup, Schrödinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that, by the laws of quantum mechanics, branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not.
This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting.
Electrons have an electric charge, a negative one, and quarks have electric charges in thirds.
This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics.
This E8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots.
In this regard, new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies.
Your theory of everything -- Garrett Lisi: I'm used to coral.
How should we think of an electron in relation to E8?
GL: No, it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape.
And so, the assignment to the students was, how should the steak of tomorrow be?
And they turned at once and walked away.
This image by Ted Joseph was from that book, and was his, sort of, police sketch of what the creatures looked like that Whitley Strieber had described to him.
And I watched those constellations shift, hoping that they would part and I would see her face.
You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses, and one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.
A magazine?
And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary, in this case the 1913 dictionary.
And it involves a great deal of technique.
Architectural photography is extremely glamorous.
You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.
Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous.
Here's Hedy Lamarr again.
It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent -- not transparent, not opaque.
And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person, maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot, because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.
David Hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash, which only took a fraction of a second to happen.
And so, really, so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet.
We first began by looking at heart disease, and when I began doing this work 26 or 27 years ago, it was thought that once you have heart disease it can only get worse.
Because we doctors do what we get paid to do, and we get trained to do what we get paid to do, so if we change insurance, then we change medical practice and medical education.
And the insurance companies found that they began to save almost 30,000 dollars per patient, and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project where they’re paying for 1,800 people to go through the program on the sites that we train.
There are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain, but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem.
You’ll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth, and "impotence" -- the headline is, "Impotent" -- it’s not emphysema.
Dr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died, and we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs, the "bad carbs," and these are things like --  -- sugar, white flour, white rice, alcohol. And you get a double whammy: you get all these calories that don’t fill you up because you’ve removed the fiber, and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up.
And the problem is that it’s based on this half-truth, which is that Americans eat too many simple carbs, so if you eat fewer simple carbs you’re going to lose weight.
Now, the third curve is information technology.
And the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable when my kids reach my age -- and I think that's -- in other words, the next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share.
Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail.
With that preamble, let's show the first two-minute videotape, which shows a little airplane for surveillance and moving to a giant airplane.
Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance -- in effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble and launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.
Buckminster Fuller said it clearly: "there are no passengers on spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew, can and must do more with less -- much less."
The friendly support, the quiet confidence, congenial hospitality shown by our Hawaiian and military hosts --  this is starting -- made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable.
You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it, looking out of its camera.
PM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better and be able to fly the plane better.
You can do amazing things when you realize what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales, you realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s -- but when you get down to the nature's realm, nature has 200 million years of experience.
If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material -- if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise, and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed.
As we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side.
These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking at these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good.
Aqua Rocket: coming this summer.
KS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this, and they asked us, when's it coming out?
And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important from a technical standpoint.
Now, I'm not going to get into the physics of it, but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling, the greater the stopping force.
It's so safe you could drink this stuff.
Now, think about your interactions with aluminum foil.
For our next technology, it's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink.
And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.
Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe, the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about, and his reality.
This is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life.
If killing in a war is a crime, then you have to charge every soldier in the world.
A seat works in a two-dimensional world, where gravity blasts down on that seat, OK?
Now, go into the real atmosphere of this planet.
Before I could turn around, everyone on the tracks was screaming and running.
We think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed.
And I want to ask three questions in this talk, in the 10 minutes that remain, about the blogosphere.
If I had a jar of jellybeans and I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar, your average guess would be remarkably good.
A network is not just the product of its component parts.
It is something more than that.
People have linked to it, and so other people in turn link to it, etc., etc.
You know, this is a conference inspired by nature.
And I said, "Well, I'm going to have to spread that message."
It’s actually got a bunch of circles on it.
And this fear is what causes us to be conservative in our thinking.
OK, so if you try the same exercise with kids, they have no embarrassment at all.
So all of these places have these symbols.
Now, our big symbol at IDEO is actually not so much the place, it’s a thing.
And it’s actually something that we invented a few years ago, or created a few years ago.
Helps us do our jobs better, and helps us feel better when we do them.
So the average Western first-grader spends as much as 50 percent of their play time taking part in what’s called "construction play."
Because when we looked at the video when he got back, we saw 20 minutes of this.
The first thing to remember is that play is not anarchy.
And then will come what they call the heart, the lush heart note.
This smells of cut grass. Now, this is the skeleton of the molecule.
This smells of cut grass. Now, this is the skeleton of the molecule.
OK, now. Why does this thing smell of cut grass, OK?
And that’s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape.
Here’s how shape works in normal receptors.
This is -- in other words, we never get the O-H -- we never mistake it for an S-H, OK?
However, I managed to get a hold of a Borane eventually, and here is the beast.
And it really does have the same -- if you calculate, if you measure the vibrational frequencies, they are the same as S-H.
And this network of relations is ever-evolving.
I think there are a couple -- there are many reasons -- but a couple just to focus on briefly.
European governments, for the most part, haven't acknowledged responsibility, and there's nothing to kind of to push back and up against.
As we saw, they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports or reigning in loose nukes.
I mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was.
I don't know where inspiration comes from.
Again, I don't know where inspiration comes from.
That is not boring. That is nothing if it's not boring.
Right? And then I realized, that was on my website, and then it said, like, you know, the quote was attributed to me and I thought, oh, I said something, you know, in an interview.
I forgot that I said that. But it's really true.
IM: Yeah, it is, exactly.
But even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves, sometimes there are setbacks.
Well, I always say it's important that you are smart, but every once in a while it's good to be lucky.
CE: That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this.
So anyway, let me continue on showing you a little bit about the beauty of that planet.
EB: The inside doesn't get very hot.
But that last one percent, as it always seems to be, is the tricky part.
It's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen in a very short amount of time.
LC: So it's in a free-fall, but it's also trying to use all of its actuators to make sure that it's in the right position to land.
So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started it'll already be over.
If you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation, you know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor.
If you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation, you know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor.
We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet, which indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know, below the surface.
And over the next few years, as we keep orbiting, you know, Saturn, we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface and make more accurate measurements.
So if you were on Titan, you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder, and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane.
So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.
And I can show here a very good example.
It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.
And this is my --  -- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.
So, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.
I mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all Mr. Haring's various works, in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.
In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.
But I think it could still benefit from more discipline.
And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.
OK, I mean, I can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.
This is a picture by Rene Magritte, and I'd like you all to inwardly -- like in your head, that is -- to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.
Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.
And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.
This is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old, and look what happened to it.
This is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old, and look what happened to it.
And you'll notice that on the left, on the left, on the west, it's very steep, and on the right it's gentle.
It would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is.
It's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure.
And in fact, pretty soon we'll hear the sound.
There are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living.
We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona join us on the expedition.
Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right.
And we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction.
Well, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth, and by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay, we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars.
It's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten, a little bit of tungsten, left over, that's the kind of mine it was.
That's what the property was originally built around -- it was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine.
They both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine.
Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain.
Now, Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition, "Make the clock inaccessible.
This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years.
OK, let's take one more look at the mountain itself.
Now, at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave.
Some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars.
It has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs.
Police corruption.
I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways.
But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us.
And so the question is: how did that material get here?
We're going to try and follow it up.
We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study, and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine, in a certain sense.
You see the whole big picture?
So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture, and I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.
And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming.
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space, and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean.
So the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter.
There's a very simple fluid to begin with.
And we're going to fly around, and we'll fly around, and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect, and you get a large cluster of galaxies.
that is, galaxies and stars and so forth.
And then, to have to deal with large groups, say, at the nation-state level, and we had to have mutual non-aggression, or through a series of conflicts, we eventually came to a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace.
You can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the Internet if you want to, and clearly someone recently -- I saw in a science magazine -- they said, well, the 1918 flu is too dangerous to FedEx around.
You can download the gene sequences of pathogens off the Internet if you want to, and clearly someone recently -- I saw in a science magazine -- they said, well, the 1918 flu is too dangerous to FedEx around.
I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers, but we don't have very good software for them.
The inside of the nanotubes is so small -- the smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers -- that it's basically a quantum world.
New ways of making electric transportation.
We have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling that still works, roughly. That's Tamiflu.
So if we can address, use technology, help address education, help address the environment, help address the pandemic, does that solve the larger problem that I was talking about in the Wired article? And I'm afraid the answer is really no, because you can't solve a problem with the management of technology with more technology.
So if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on.
Our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes.
Our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes.
I mean, it's crucified.
It's pending here in California, and just recently in New York.
Basically you take a goose or a duck and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat.
I mean, I love the stuff.
The electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside.
The Lupin bush, it's all around Extremadura.
Great creativity can make politicians electable, or parties unelectable.
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips.
Our climate is changing quickly, too quickly.
This is why it’s happening.
You should also keep your blood pressure down, because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.
But it's believed that the oldest living Redwoods are perhaps 2,500 years old -- roughly the age of the Parthenon -- although it's also suspected that there may be individual trees that are older than that.
Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time.
Plant this small seed, wait 2,000 years, and you get this: the Lost Monarch.
This particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base and extends upward for 150 feet.
This is a flying buttress.
If a portion of a Redwood is rotting, the Redwood will send roots into its own form and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart.
And what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept, basically, was instantly and thoroughly ignored, and like, two months into the whole thing, -- which is really a small amount of time, even in Second Life time -- I remember the users, the people who were then using Second Life, the residents came to me and said, we want to buy the disco --
This is done entirely using, kind of, the tools that are built into Second Life, so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby, of course -- Second Life is, at the platform level, at the level of the company -- at Linden Lab -- Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever.
And of course, the existence of an economy is another idea.
And of course, the existence of an economy is another idea.
I don't think we can get away from those changes.
A lot of hydrogen's produced today in the world.
The automobile becomes, then, an appliance, not in a commodity sense, but an appliance, mobile power, mobile platform for information and computing and communication, as well as a form of transportation.
If we can see this possible future, others can too.
But this piece is due out in May.
I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done of some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you.
This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow.
They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up.
It was hard on the cats, but it made a great little instrument.
Finally, by the end of the day, we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton.
And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier.
And I don't want it to leave me behind.
That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect.
Man, we were only 10, but we knew that made gunpowder.
We said, well, what are you going to do with it?
There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet; the air was the just full of black smoke.
She came home, she took that chemistry set away, and we never saw it again.
So I like to invent things too, and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back.
That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand.
We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.
After that, it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in, kind of, a mangle.
I've had the privilege of living by a meadow for the last little while, and it is terribly engaging.
That it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there.
In the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imagination that are computer controlled.
And all throughout the library are different objects, different spaces.
All of imagination -- everything that we think, we feel, we sense -- comes through the human brain.
The mystery persisted for about 20 years.
I went there, and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars.
It was like, 160 dollars for this?
It's like foie gras -- it's not even like steak.
And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet.
It has 360-degree views.
It has four balconies.
It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.
It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.
I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.
It tasted fine. It tasted interesting.
It was very green, it was very peppery.
And apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know, hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries.
And you know, it had this fragrant softness, and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil.
It turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738 by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.
Now, this simple equation, even for those of you who don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period. Here's another nice example.
Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package?
Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story: $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars, so you decide to mull it over for a week.
By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone -- the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.
When you arrive at the theater, you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.
You've all experienced this yourself, even if you've never come into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question: You want to buy a car stereo.
Most people say they would.
CA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying that our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?
Talk more about it.
Is terror the right response?
CA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event -- that it's so spectacular?
So there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media, who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can.
People get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty.
Aubrey de Grey: My name's Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge.
I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills -- I work on aging -- and I'm interested in doing something about it, as we'll all hear tomorrow.
But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet with external eyes, not just as our home.
So, my first bold prediction is that, is that in the universe, life is going to be everywhere.
So, my first bold prediction is that, is that in the universe, life is going to be everywhere.
So this is a very bold statement.
How do you plan to look for it?
How do you know it when you find it?
How do you know it when you find it?
Because if it's big and obvious, we would've already found it -- it would've already bitten us on the foot, and it hasn't.
So, we know that it's probably quite cryptic.
Very critically, how do we protect it, if we find it, and not contaminate it?
And also, even perhaps more critically, because this is the only home planet we have, how do we protect us from it, while we study it?
So why might it be hard to find?
Well, it's probably microscopic, and it's never easy to study microscopic things, although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater depth, at much smaller scales than ever before.
And speed of activity, which is something that we face in our work with sub-surface organisms, because they grow very, very slowly.
This is one of the richest caves that we have found on the planet, anywhere.
In some of the other amazing caves that we work in -- this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad, and this is one of the most famous caves in the world.
And right now we're in caves, and we're doing science and recreation, but I think in the future we'll be using them for habitat and science on these other bodies.
One of the burning questions, of course, is if we go there and find life in the sub-surface, as I fully expect that we will, is that a second genesis of life?
Did life start here and was it transported there?
It's real. In fact, I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of, if not one of the most, perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature.
It's a deep tendency toward order in nature that opposes what we've all been taught about entropy.
Let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous.
We don't see anything like this in Europe or in the West.
And for a long time, even after it was documented, it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion.
Can you hear that?
Anyway, so this is the world's smallest metronome.
These cables were on the side of the bridge, like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames -- that's what's holding up this bridge.
So I want to first show you some interviews with people who were on the bridge on opening day, who will describe what happened.
Engineer: I felt I was disappointed about it.
This was to be the focus of the investigation.
Interviewer: You designed this, yes, this simulated bridge, and this, you reckon, mimics the action of the real bridge?
But then, of course, everyone is driving the bridge.
They've leapfrogged.
And it's not completely gratuitous, because "wok" and "roll" -- Chinese food and Japanese foods, so it kind of works out.
And he has marched very far indeed, because he is sweet, he is fried, and he is chicken -- all things that Americans love.
It was introduced into the United States in the 1800s, but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s.
I showed them the pictures of General Tso Chicken, and they were like, "We don't know this dish. Is this Chinese food?"
My neighbor, Alessandra, was shocked when I told her, "Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."
My neighbor, Alessandra, was shocked when I told her, "Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."
But that dish also took about 10 years to spread across America from a restaurant in New York City.
One day, somebody suggested I read this book.
It was called -- it was called "The Air Pump," or something like "The Leviathan and The Air Pump."
And Boyle said, bullshit.
And he did all these cute little experiments.
And -- I -- I -- I got this book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where there's a missile base.
You know, that's what you call a lead.
And everybody stepped back a little and said, you know, we ought to invest in this shit, because whoever has got the most of these people working in the places is going to have a dominant position, at least in the military, and probably in all kind of economic ways.
And they -- and they have these big meetings where they try to figure out how we're going to -- how we're going to continually prove that the planet is getting warmer, when that's actually contrary to most people's sensations.
I mean, the temperature as measured -- and you can find this on our wonderful Internet, you just go and look for all NASAs records, and all the Weather Bureau's records, and you'll look at it yourself, and you'll see, the temperature has just -- the nighttime temperature measured on the surface of the planet has gone up a tiny little bit.
But in fact, it was just coming up -- it was the nighttime; the daytime temperatures didn't go up.
And those two papers came out in Science Magazine, February the first, and these -- the conclusion in both of these papers, and in also the Science editor's, like, descriptions of these papers, for, you know, for the quickie, is that our theories about global warming are completely wrong. I mean, what these guys were doing, and this is what -- the NASA people have been saying this for a long time.
And in this paper, they show something much more striking, and that was that they did what they call a radiation -- and I'm not going to go into the details of it, actually it's quite complicated, but it isn't as complicated as they might make you think it is by the words they use in those papers. If you really get down to it, they say, the sun puts out a certain amount of energy --
Well, they found out in this study -- these two studies by two different teams -- that five and a half watts per square meter had been coming in from 1998, 1999, and the place didn't get warmer.
It's not by a small one. They just -- they just misinterpreted the fact that the earth -- there's obviously some mechanisms going on that nobody knew about, because the heat's coming in and it isn't getting warmer.
Don't forget: a computer came out; it had no software.
Don't forget: a computer came out; it had no software.
You'd buy that thing, you'd bring it home, you'd plug it in, and it would do absolutely nothing at all.
Who of you grew up in a family business, suffered the torture? Yes, yes.
The torture was good. Wasn't it good torture?
And then luckily, you know, I had the fortune of going to something called a library, and in the library I came upon this very book.
I found this book. It's called, "Thoughts on Design," by a man named Paul Rand.
It's a little slim volume; I'm not sure if you've seen this.
And that little program's on that cardboard disk.
And so, I began to think more carefully about the computer.
There's my perspective. Because in reality, the problem isn't how to make the world more technological.
There's my perspective. Because in reality, the problem isn't how to make the world more technological.
Looking at dinosaur evolution and studying it, digging it up for many years, I end up looking at the mammal radiation, and it seems as though everything is quick time, just like technology, advancing by an order of magnitude.
Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace, an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it.
So we were the first to actually name a bird from the famous series that later exploded onto the pages of Science and Nature.
So, all the other dinosaurs that you know, or your kids know, at least, on four legs.
It looks rather bird-like because it is.
We prototyped by CAT-scanning the brain out of this animal.
All the stuff from Jurassic Park that you know of -- all those small animals -- they all come from northern continents.
Somebody get the front legs.
We have downgraded this factor.
Volantor-like helicopter, perhaps.
Unbeknownst to many of you, the highway in the sky that I'm talking about here has been under construction for 10 years.
But the vehicle itself is going to be a very, very controlled environment.
Fortunately, Dr. Felix Wankel invented the rotary engine.
A very unique engine -- it's round, it's small, it's vibration-free.
And we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine, and continued to hover.
So, for roughly 300 years, the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture, because the nose was one-fifth of your head, or because your head was one-seventh of your body.
So, what I thought I would bring up is another component that needs to be thought of, whenever you think about nature, and that's basically the invention of generic form in genetic evolution.
So, instead of trying to find the ideal type or the ideal average, he'd always look for the exception. So, in this example, which is an example of what's called Bateson's Rule, he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb.
When I first saw this image, 10 years ago, I actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time.
It's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set; we knew that at the beginning. So, I actually went to some people I knew down south in San Diego, and we used an exploded titanium forming method that's used in the aerospace industry.
We know a lot about what's going on with design around the world, and it's getting increasingly more difficult to find design that reflects a unique culture.
He's a Spanish architect and designer.
He's a Spanish architect and designer.
And I recognized that oftentimes design, when you're set up to see design, it can be a bit of a letdown.
Red is a color in the landscape that is often on stop signs.
But I'm convinced that it's because you're walking around the streets and seeing things.
It gave me possibilities for wonder -- if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree, and create some installations.
And I came outside, and the valets for this car service had created, you know, quite a nice little collage of these car keys, and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that I had seen in Tokyo.
This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago, where the Spanish artist-designer Plensa has created, kind of, a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people in this area.

Hardly anybody listened to him in his day.
Because whole grain -- it's easy with white flour to make a good-tasting bread. White flour is sweet.
So, this is the challenge for this bread.
So, this is the challenge for this bread.
Then we get into fermentation, the third stage, which is really where the flavor develops.
It's yeast burps and sweat.
But then, quickly through the next few stages.
But then, quickly through the next few stages.
Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive.
Yes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life.
We harvest the wheat, and in harvesting it, we kill it.
We harvest the wheat, and in harvesting it, we kill it.
And at that point, the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity.
It's not only been killed, but it's been denied any potential for creating future life.
And what do we do? We add some water.
In stage one, we weigh it.
You see, the baker, in this moment, has become, in a sense, sort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well, while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive.
And we know it's alive because in stage three, it grows. Growth is the proof of life.
Enzymes are breaking forth sugars.
So all these things are determined by the baker, and the bread goes through some stages, and characters develop.
And at stage 10, we take it to the oven.
I've met some dough eaters, but -- it's not the staff of life, right? Bread is the staff of life.
But it's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there.
So you see the symbolism at work? It's starting to come forth a little bit, you know.
It's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life.
And --  they -- they're invented around the same time. I think beer came first.
So, if I, kind of, break this bread, maybe we can share this now a little bit here.
Why? Because the experience happens inside of us.
Two or three cents per cup -- that's what coffee is worth.
Two or three cents per cup -- that's what coffee is worth.
Till a couple months later, I went back to the same airport -- same plane, I think -- and looked up, and it said C.
I'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so.
And this graffiti artist has come along, made this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.
It's something everybody has.
It's not a matter of teaching it; in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can't quantify it: it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design, but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter.
When I got done it was 540 pages, and then the publisher, Gingko Press, ended up cutting it down considerably: it's just under 400 pages now.
When I got done it was 540 pages, and then the publisher, Gingko Press, ended up cutting it down considerably: it's just under 400 pages now.
But I decided I liked this contents page -- I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it.
You'd think maybe cement, possibly, or something.
So, this is a six-shot sequence.
This is some work from Ray Gun.
Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article -- so I set the whole article in Dingbat.
You could -- you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something: it is the actual article.
You could -- you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something: it is the actual article.
And this continued through the entire magazine.
If you saw 2001: A Space Odyssey, and you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith, you know, that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species.
But also, the genome is really the instruction manual.
What does a genome look like?
They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease.
So, then what do you do?
We can figure out what the heck terroir is.
I love the science fiction movies.
I mean, there we are.
And that's the fate of a planet, too.
And they've tried over and over and over again.
This whole Gaia idea, that life makes the world better for itself -- anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles believing in the Gaia theory? No.
So, I really suspect there's an alternative, and that life does actually try to do itself in -- not consciously, but just because it does.
Its temperature drops.
And you know what I found out?
The Indo-European root of the word hope is a stem, K-E-U -- we would spell it K-E-U; it's pronounced koy -- and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from.
It's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by?
So, it's fun to think about the etymology of the word "patient."
And it was an arm that, instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record, went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm.
Hasn't changed that much.
Light came out of it in every direction.
That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are.
And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made.
We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles.
We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles.
They have literally beat a path to our door.
We've been selling it since about last September, October, and it's been immensely gratifying.
You turn up the volume just a little bit -- I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels -- and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.
Here's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow.
Now, imagine, if you will, without getting too technical, I'm making a little sine wave here in the air.
Linearity means higher quality sound.
Now, the question is, where's the sound made?
Instead of being made on the face of the cone, it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air, and so when I aim it towards you, what you hear is made right next to your ears.
When you listen to stereo on your home system, your both ears hear both speakers.
So, the stage is more restricted -- the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you.
SS: Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit, and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete.
And at about 85 meters of my 100 meters sprint, in all my glory, I came out of my leg.
And it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there.
And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with foot injuries.
AM: Yeah, I definitely have to be moving, and balance is a little bit of an art in them.
Actually, we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you're walking around healthy.
Everything that we could get out of GenBank -- that is, the national repository of sequences.
No one tests for parainfluenza-4. No one cares about it.
There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it.
I'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes that's unpublished -- it's going to come out tomorrow -- and it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip to find something new and open a new door.
And the viral genome I'm showing you right here?
And the viral genome I'm showing you right here?
It's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new; no one's ever seen it before.
Its closest relative is, in fact, from mice, and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus, because it's infecting a species other than mice.
They all have the same virus, but they're different enough that there's reason to believe that they've been independently acquired.
I'm going to play a piece of music for you.
Airs were played in Europe at burials, as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site, the procession was led by a piper or a fiddle player.
DL: We're going to play a tune and Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano.
The Cape Breton piano playing is just awesome. It's very rhythmic and, you'll see it.
by train and brought in on a horse, a horse and sleigh to the house.
by train and brought in on a horse, a horse and sleigh to the house.
There are a lot of new things that are happening to do that, but fundamentally the process requires a tremendous amount of energy.
Hopefully, if we can reduce the amount of energy it takes to make the cells, that will become more practical.
And this is the shape that evolved.
And one of the great ones of all time, James Watt's steam engine of 1788 was a major, major breakthrough.
But, his refinements were incredible.
Another type of engine is the hot air engine.
And the hot air engine also was not invented by Robert Stirling, but Robert Stirling came along in 1816 and radically improved it.
This engine, because it was so interesting -- it only worked on air, no steam -- has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the Stirling engine principle.
But after the Stirling engine, Otto came along, and also, he didn't invent the internal combustion engine, he just refined it.
But after the Stirling engine, Otto came along, and also, he didn't invent the internal combustion engine, he just refined it.
So, once you have mobility, now you're making a lot of engines because you've got lots of units, as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you're not making as many units, so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn't benefit.
So when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end, it puts some heat into the sponge.
Each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it.
The hot water's optional.
This is how we envision it would be in a residential installation: you'd probably have more than one unit on your roof.
Basically, oil is solar energy concentrate.
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.
Well, what's the history of this disease?
And the disease was all over the world.
Now, ironically, what happened was it was eliminated from all the temperate zones, which is where the rich countries are.
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.
But, malaria -- even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact.
Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.
The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.
And she said, "What are you talking about?"
That poster is not folded.
Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.
And here, a very peculiar poster because, simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer, it won't sit still in the space.
At times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front, and then it shifts.
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it, and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and I didn't want to be embarrassed, so I worked very hard on this.
But then again, it's on my list of didactic posters.
Well, not always.
Why? Because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go.
This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention.
And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.
The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine that makes red wine good for you into beer.
An almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico called an axolotl that can re-generate its limbs.
You can freeze half its heart. It regrows.
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system."
You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect?
Whether we're born in San Francisco, or Sudan, or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy, we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust.
The ATA is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes, and hooked together with computers.
And over those long distances, its signal is very faint when it reaches us.
So I want to show you a clip of the film now.
We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.
So, when you're faced with something like that, of course you've got to break it down.
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations.
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.
Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.
Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.
But, this is really just the tip of the iceberg.
And of course, the third problem is the one I found out the hard way in Palau, which is the bends.
Now the one thing that I forgot to mention, is that to obviate the problem of the nitrogen narcosis -- all of those blue dots in our body -- you remove the nitrogen and you replace it with helium.
In 1994, I was fortunate enough to get access to these prototype closed-circuit rebreathers.
The most fundamental of these is called the breathing loop.
Now, as we breathe, we produce carbon dioxide, and that carbon dioxide needs to be scrubbed out of the system.
Also, when you get down there, you find that the water is very, very clear.
This was taken exactly 300 feet above my head.
I started to realize that I could look at the whole city as a living organism.
And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature.
The construction began in 1837.
This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.
The tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the Manhattan Project.
Most of my photos are set in places that have been abandoned for decades, but this is an exception.
But it wasn't just individuals.
As have this guy's.
One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person or a specific message.
We built an application-programming interface, which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter.
Summize built a Twitter search engine.
For instance, here's what people are saying about TED.
One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta.
Then we formed a spin-off company.
This is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of.
The acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro-climate, to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses.
So if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of losing everything again.
That was why I put it as a single point up there.
What I really did was I just followed nature, and nature doesn't know monocultures, but a natural forest is multilayered.
And finally I made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain.
Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back.
They have enough income for three families.
There is no simple one recipe for one place.
Up in the canopy, if you were sitting next to me and you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems, you would also see scenes like this.
These mosses are taken from the forest; they're used by the floriculture industry, by florists, to make arrangements and make hanging baskets.
The "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado, called Craig.
And the job in question was sheep rancher.
Melanie picks up the lamb -- two hands -- one hand on both legs on the right, likewise on the left.
And I'm like that's not rubber at all, you know.
A second later, with a big thumb and a well calloused forefinger, he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.
Now you think you know what's coming, Michael -- you don't, OK?
He goes to his box and he pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands.
I'm like, this is not a good sign for this lamb, at all.
And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time.
I go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off.
I do.
And I hear that story over and over.
But, what it all comes down to is this.
I formed a theory, and I'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds.
It's a cold war, really.
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.
Beneath it is a wonderful knife.
First of all, look at the shape -- it's just wonderful to look at.
Second of all, it's really beautifully balanced: it holds well, it feels well.
And third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts.
It's a delight to use.
And so it's got everything, right?
It's beautiful and it's functional.
If you type in, oh say, "emotion and design," you get 10 pages of results.
So I type "design emotion" and my website wasn't first again.
It's so much fun to drive."
And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it, this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.
Intense fear paralyzes you.
So, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk, and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.
Would you tie those two strings together?"
So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here and they couldn't reach the other string.
And when people are finished, they don't throw it away.
And when people are finished, they don't throw it away.
Visceral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
I'm walking around the stage -- I'm not attending to the control of my legs.
It's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot.
And when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.
And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing.
It's being safe in the world.
It's kind of neat. What a wonderful design.
And I'm here to unveil our latest effort, and most successful effort so far, which is still very much a work in process.
Another even more important difference is that in mass production, this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging -- could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck.
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice.
Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art.
A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore.
I think of Shakespeare's Shylock: "If you prick us, do we not bleed, and if you tickle us, do we not laugh?"
A play ballet.
Imaginative play.
A really important part of being a player is imaginative solo play.
Well, a lot.
And this is one of the ways you can study play -- is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram.
The reason I put this here is also to queue up my thoughts about objectifying what play does.
In the animal world, if you take rats, who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years and you suppress play -- they squeak, they wrestle, they pin each other, that's part of their play.
You know, you can tell -- and I think when we're getting into collective play, its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety through their own sharing of play signals.
And you'll find, you may change jobs -- which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this -- in order to be more empowered through their play.
The Wearable Meeting.
Because when you put it on, you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting.
And its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain.
So going back to 1989, I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.
But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens -- 18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side, as a sort of a play project, kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.
So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like: hypertext protocol, HTTP; the idea of URLs, these names for things which started with HTTP.
So if you just imagined them all being part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky, say on the Internet, then life would be so much easier.
Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?
So I want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did, but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data.
In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data in a government department, often you find that these people, they're very tempted to keep it -- Hans calls it database hugging.
So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.
What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons?
It's very very important.
Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.
Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.
Now that title, that phrase, comes from a critic, an early critic, and this is a passage that I just love, and would like to read for you.
Today, though, I’m going to talk about Darwin’s other strange inversion, which is equally puzzling at first, but in some ways just as important.
Let’s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector, because sugar is high energy, and it’s just been wired up to the preferer, to put it very crudely, and that’s why we like sugar.
You have to look in our brains to understand why they’re sweet.
Now, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point, and you must have wondered what's the right approach.
So originally I didn't have much money, so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice.
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities, and I want to talk to you about cheating.
The first experiment -- I walked around MIT and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators -- these were common refrigerators for the undergrads.
Well, this isn't exactly true.
And over a few hours, I eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I -- it's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality.
Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book.
But I discovered, in researching further, really wanting precise reference, that one of the original lead birds had been sold at Christie's in 1994, and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original Christie's catalogue, and in it I found this magnificent picture, which included a size reference.
I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan, a New Jersey editor, actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in 1991, although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers' specifications, because there was a lot of controversy about it.
It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made.
Yeah, I know!
There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things, which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin, you lose a little bit of volume, you lose a little bit of size.
So what do I do? I figure I have two options.
This is auto-gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s.
The auto-gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter, but it should have -- it wasn't a big success.
Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit, just for the fun of it. This was a piece I did -- a brochure again -- "RMS Tyrannic: The Biggest Thing in All the World."
Urban absurdism -- that's what the New Yorker really calls for.
And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at income as only one variable.
But that was interesting in itself. This is companies like Vonage.
Basically you take an ordinary telephone, you plug it into this little box that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem.
Ever since that Jayson Blair jerk ruined it for all of us.
It was not very conducive to innovation.
You can see what I said about it. It's a flawed masterpiece.
It's got bad things and good things. Lets all acknowledge that right now.
It's like, "It only has one button.
This is amazing. This is Midomi.
A song is running through your head -- you sing it into the thing: do do do do do, da da da da da da, da dum ...
It will immediately play you that song or that band.
You say if you like this song or not.
I want an iPhone.
If this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point, why was it the case that it took us until 1984 to be able to discover this virus?
Now we have our own liquid nitrogen.
Another, different kind of poem of youth and age.
A student, a young woman in a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee, perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes; a teacher passes and chides her, "Be careful, you might fall," almost banteringly chides her, "You might fall," and the young woman, 18, a girl really, though she wouldn't think that, as brilliant as she is, first in her class, and "Beautiful, too," she's often told,
Weightfully this self which weighed upon me, the release from which is what I desire and what I achieve.
There are several scenarios for the future newspaper.
And the process we made was not about changing the look, it was about improving the product completely.
Wingsuit flying is a suit, that I can make fly, just only with my body.
I was asked by Wilsonart International, a plastic laminate company, which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world -- they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York, in 2000.
Unfortunately, this particular call would not end well.
By the time the soldier advanced close enough to see the telltale wires of the bomb, it exploded in a wave of flame.
In a quick show of hands, how many people in this room still use Wang Computers?  It's the same thing in war. The British and the French invented the tank.
The typical one that I was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a Predator strike taking out an enemy site. Missile hits, bodies burst into the air with the explosion.
It was set to music.
And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions, and really to follow my journey.
We only meet them once.
They don't come back several times, so it really chronicles a journey.
He built the capital over there.
So you'll see images of this remarkable building.
A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it, it was built entirely by hand, I think they got a crane the last year.
The building was finished in 1983.
You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him.
Now, what is game theory about?
We need to know how focused they are on the problem at hand.
And so we have to figure out how they balance those two things.
What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium, a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean, named Vibrio fischeri.
Again, another plug for the animals in the ocean, Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid.
What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid, and it's been turned on its back, and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells, they live in there, at high cell number that molecule is there, and they're making light.
The way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii, just in sort of shallow knee-deep water.
The squid is nocturnal, so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps, but then at night it has to come out to hunt.
What the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria.
Then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back.
And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom -- which is made by the bacterium -- exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back, so the squid doesn't make a shadow.
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean.
And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep, it buries itself in the sand, and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm, and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria.
Now the bacteria are dilute, that little hormone molecule is gone, so they're not making light -- but of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand.
So, they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor, and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria.
They take that information inside, and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority of any given population.
Then again we turn to chemistry, and we figured out what this generic molecule is -- that was the pink ovals on my last slide, this is it.
We've also done the same thing with the pink system.
In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule, but the logic is exactly the same.
What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal, in this case, a mouse, it doesn't initiate virulence right away.
Or this ad that I read in the New York Times: "Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society.
Where you deny the other person's reality, you have paradox where you allow more than one reality to coexist, I think there's another philosophical construction.
You know, make you not follow your usual train of association, but make you rewire.
The stories that we tell -- what we push out -- becomes who we are.
Now we're running a stimulus package.
We have to make the right moral decision.
This is not the stomping ground of our Pleistocene ancestors.
This is not the stomping ground of our Pleistocene ancestors.
The approval process is going to fall apart, actually.
It's too slow.
It's too risk-averse.
It didn't happen.
It's a total media circus.
It will happen in five to 10 years.
Humanity is going to go down this path.
Imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material.
This first project is called the AlloBrain.
And I would like to share my art.
That set me on the road to examining biomechanics.
Last thing, breathing. A problem a lot of us have, certainly, when you're swimming.
So I think you'll agree, they look quite good together.
When I imagine my life, what my life would have been like without the educational opportunities that I had, it makes me wonder.
This is a climb called the Dike Route, on Pywjack Dome, up in the Yosemite high country.
And it's a project that we've actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world, who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project, in many of its different aspects.
It's true.
Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble?
Cast it in bronze."
The next few minutes is, we're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug.
This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the 19th century.
Now mathematicians have answered that question.
There is, there's a third alternative.
Now, I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible.
They've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years.
And that's true. But it also goes deeper than that.
The product was that airplane.
You couldn't transfer those to the model itself.
When I started this chair it was not a preconceived notion.
And I felt, the one thing they don't need, is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there.
So I took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn't have to fuss with it.
But you know most good chairs do recline because it's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing and better flow.
So that's where a headrest comes in.
I've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place.
But then I knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with headrests that nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position.
And I did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people.
This kind of Arkansas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, West Virginia region.
So yes, racism is predictable.
It's about who you live with.
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem, even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism.
This is just a couple of them from January 17th, last year.
And our system was rudimentary. It was very basic.
The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature.
Children don't like it.
It's why they leave lights on around the house.  Adults find it comforting.
You know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods.
By this age the brain can actually store.
By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities.
And by this age there is absolutely no question that this brain, it has a person on board.
All it takes for example in the sound domain, is exposure to sound.
So for example I can rear an animal in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound, a repertoire of sound that I make up, that I make, just by exposure, artificially important to the animal and its young brain.
This is required so the brain sets up it's processing so that it can act differentially, so that it can act selectively, so that the creature that wears it, that carries it, can begin to operate on it in a selective way.
In the next great epoch of life, which applies for most of life, the brain is actually refining its machinery as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities.
So here is a very simple experiment.
So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all.
But the monkey gradually developed a strategy.
You are constructed, your self is constructed from these billions of events.
It's constructed. It's created in your brain.
The child's native language is such a case is not English.
And the brain specializes for it.
Now the crap doesn't just happen in the ear.
It can also happen in the brain.
Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain.
Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain.
The point is is that you can train the brain out of this.
And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which, for example, the brain is representing language again.
But also in your future is brain aerobics.
So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas, but I told my daughter that this is one exception --  -- that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.
In domestic birds, especially chickens, it's 100 percent lethal.
And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens, and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers with the result that there's cover-up.
And we don't have a huge number of people who got infected and never developed disease.
Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H5N1.
Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time, well, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.
That may be because those events were occurring on the other side of the world where nobody was paying attention.
And it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah until the Samarra bombings in the Iraqi elections of '06.
This is when the surge happens.
They became more robust.
We can talk to them. We can get a solution. The opposite happened.
Inside of the bronze ball there's a lead weight that is free-swinging on an axle that's on two bearings that pass in between, across it, like this, that counterbalance this weight.
So it allows it to roll.
But in this case because the interior is free-swinging in relation to the sphere, it can stand up on one point.
But in this case because the interior is free-swinging in relation to the sphere, it can stand up on one point.
This is sculpture that I made that -- it's magnetically levitated.
Except there is a slight tether here, which keeps it from going over the top of its field.
It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave.
It's balancing on a shaft and a ball, right at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity, which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty.
So you can see it rotating here.
It weighs about a ton or over a ton.
It's made of stainless steel, quite thick.
But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium.
This is the control room inside of the ship.
It's like a traveling show.
It has speakers on it. And it has cameras over the surface of it.
The cabin is open or closed, as you like.
But then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations -- all of the things that we're concerned with today.
And then at night the idea is that it would be used as kind of a rave situation, where the people could cut loose, and the music and the lights, and everything.
And so interacting with the same kind of imagery.
And so interacting with the same kind of imagery.
Bread is not only standard in the Western diet.
And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here, it's very important to understand what that revolution did to us.
It brought us power. It brought us mechanization, fertilizers.
But actually the real relevant bread, historically, is this white Wonder loaf.
So as food became more plentiful, bread became cheaper.
And today, bread now is associated with obesity, which is very strange.
So bread has become from a main staple, a source of calories associated with obesity and also a source of modernity, of modern life.
In fact not many of you know that our bread, of course, was not a European invention.
We cannot just think that small-scale is the solution to the world food problem.
We need to think that land is multi-functional.
It has different functions.
Never before, as I said, has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few.
Never before, as I said, has the responsibility for food been in the hands of so few.
He did not speak about rice, in India. He said, "To those who have to go without two meals a day, God can only appear as bread."
So enjoy your bread.
And we haven't spent a lot of time talking about what that process is like.
And I think about the idea that creating an idea, spreading an idea has a lot behind it.
Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea.
So we shift gears for a minute, and say, "I know: television; advertising. Push push.
The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all.
She doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time.
And the people he surrounds himself with need the connection.
AIDS was discovered 1981; the virus, 1983.

♫ It was time to make the product, so we hooked up with Townsend ♫ ♫ Made a deal with John Neal, on the road sold ten thousand ♫ ♫ WBA, that means a trip to Nashville ♫ ♫ Festplatte showed up and said them boys are naturals ♫ ♫ Can you hear what they were hearing? See what they were seeing? ♫ ♫ From Bronx to Berlin, we took the tour European ♫
The first, to my mind, is what I call as "the ideas that have arrived."
In other words, if you don't really invest in the human capital, the same demographic dividend can be a demographic disaster.
And then I think the other point is that Indians today are far more comfortable with globalization.
One is the question of education.
For some reason, whatever reason -- lack of money, lack of priorities, because of religion having an older culture -- primary education was never given the focus it required.
And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime.
But I realized, for that to be true -- for theft of our children's future to be a crime -- there must be a clear, demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization, and is the major culprit, stealing our children's future, by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator --
So the equation is conceptual.
Still it works to help us understand the problem.
Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet since 2004, meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain, from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation -- independent third-party certified.
We call it Cool Carpet.
You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days.
Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose.
The continuum of humanity, sure, but in a larger sense, the web of life itself.
And the title for my cookbook was going to be, "Dining Without Crumbs: The Art of Eating Over the Sink."
So, I wrote a book on my research.
Now, the interesting thing about this is when I take the lines away, it's as if you haven't learned anything in the last minute.
The countries on the right, the ones that give a lot, have a slightly different form.
What was happening was the option that was useless, in the middle, was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it.
That's not one of your five steps."
Sadly, this device has been dismantled.
And in fact, he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out.
This baby is fully electric.
Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design.
I'm here because I have a very important message: I think we have found the most important factor for success.
So I went to Colombia. And I reproduced the experiment.
They taught me about what a respectful relationship should look like between men and women.
We all know.
And I think about that today because I am reminded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of closing that gap.
My husband works in this big office.
And its name, Resolute, is a reminder of the strength of character that's required not only to lead a country, but to live a life of purpose, as well.
Because the world is big.
Because seeds, in all their diverse glory, are plants' futures.
All the genetic information for future generations of plants So here is the building; it looks rather unassuming, really.
But it goes down below ground many stories.
We have training going on in China, in the USA, and many other countries.
Despite having a research establishment that is the envy of the world, more than half of the American public don't believe in evolution.
We are playing with fire.
But the balances redressed, our shared purposes assume an equal if not greater importance.
This discovery is transforming.
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment.
Information technology grows in an exponential manner.
It's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance."
Eighth Man: I had a big laugh today.
The name of the movie is "Home" -- "Maison."
On the five of June, the environment day, everybody can download the movie on Internet.
There is no business on this movie.
And the world's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion, late this century.
What's happening to the climate?
And so over time, this becomes a stress response, which has enormous effects on the body.
And that happiness is a whole other end of the equation.
People have also wanted to deconstruct.
And the rat would just keep pressing that bar thousands and thousands and thousands of times.
It wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex.
And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips to the zygomatic major.
So you see, even 10-month-old babies, when they see their mother, will show this particular kind of smile.
Extroverts use it more than introverts.
The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray is in social status.
Now in the animal world, there is only one way to increase status, and that's dominance.
Here is the actual robot.
And here is what it does.
And if you look, you can see that it uses the toe peeling, just like the gecko does.
If we can show some of the video, you can see it climbing up the wall.
There it is.
Oh. One thing I want to point out is, look at Stickybot.
You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko.
Robert Full: He talked about the tail being a whip for communication.
So we then went back and looked at the animal.
But this time what we did is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there.
So here is normal speed.
And watch it now slip, and see what it does with its tail.
And we're going to attempt the first air-righting response in a tail, with a robot.
So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself.
Now, of course, we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations, so we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.
Now, of course, we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations, so we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.
And it's better than that, it -- just in the slide -- maneuvers in mid-air.
What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight?
So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it with these capabilities? Here it is in the wind tunnel.
And it certainly looks like it.
Definitely moving towards the landing target.
Look at the end to see the animal.
But then as it gets closer to the tree, look at the close-up. And see if you can see it land.
So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.
So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.
You see it there? There? Watch it come down.
And reaching success, I always did what I loved.
I bought a fast car.
I learned that success isn't a one-way street.
It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.
It's a continuous journey.
Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one.
Well, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby.
Let's take it on a maiden voyage.
I had been growing all my own food.
I'll start here. Last November there was a presidential election.
And the media that's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations.
If you want to have a conversation in this world, you have it with one other person.
And it's not just Internet or no Internet.
Last May, China in the Sichuan province had a terrible earthquake, 7.9 magnitude, massive destruction in a wide area, as the Richter Scale has it.
Twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the US Geological Survey had anything up online for anybody to read.
But that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of.
"Please get FISA right."
People in that group realized that Obama had never shut them down.
We're beginning to look inside the brain.
We're beginning to look inside the brain.
And the reason that gives me hope is that the first thing is to admit that we have a problem.
But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem, if you will.
They died of massive infection.
And it really changed the landscape of surgery.
And the instruments are essentially working backwards.
And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist.
And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist.
But there are other barriers.
This is a cancer surgery.
"Okay. One bite. What the hell?"
So that's a way to get basic services scaled up.
This entrepreneurial energy is emerging from many quarters.
This report is our main public report.
The book is called "Blessed Unrest."
Our journey did not, in fact, begin at Hercules Inlet, where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica.
I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject.
And yet, when I look at the environment outside, you see how resistant architecture is to change.
That's what expression is.
You know the Soviet architecture of that building is the conservation.
Because architecture is also the asking of questions.
And so I do like something which is pointed, not blunt, something which is focused on reality, something that has the power, through its leverage, to transform even a very small space.
And it's not only our memory, but those who remember us, which means that architecture is not mute.
It's an art of communication.
It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires.
And of course risk. I think architecture should be risky.
You know it costs a lot of money and so on, but yes, it should not play it safe.
And yet when I think of the poverty of society which doesn't give freedom to its people, I don't admire those buildings.
And yet when I think of the poverty of society which doesn't give freedom to its people, I don't admire those buildings.
And it is about the dirty word "compromise." Compromise is not bad.
But you know the object is just a pivot.
Design was not something other.
It was part of the business of life in general.
So you can actually visit and have this three-dimensional fictional experience there.
That's what we all need to do.
So this year we're going to visualize how the brain visualizes.
A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream.
The third part that I'd like to talk about is the limbic system.
And this is deep inside of the brain. It's very old, evolutionarily.
And it's the part that feels.
I think it's the only precedent in which money has ever been stopped from being used.
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.
But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.
And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it.
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like, like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular, because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.
And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.
Well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had 1,000 years ago.
They're doing it through an outlaw thing, the informal economy.
The informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics: it's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.
That's what drought does.
Coal is what is causing the climate problems.
Coal is what is causing the climate problems.
Because everybody is downstream, downwind of whatever is done.
And in that whole idea, how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space?
Is art about that?
One is an experiment I did for BMW, an attempt to make a car.
And as you come to a new valley, as you come to a new landscape, you have a certain view.
If you stand still, the landscape doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is.
This device was just FDA approved in the last year.
But for a son, he can only get the X chromosome from his mother.
And it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development, which is kind of interesting because serotonin is supposed to make you calm and relaxed.
She goes, "No it gets worse, read this book."
Okay, so that's the first case of matricide.
But there's gonna be bad news somewhere.
So, living at the equator, we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin -- this wonderful, complex, ancient polymer compound in our skin -- served as a superb natural sunscreen.
So melanin was recruited, in our lineage, and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in Africa, to be a natural sunscreen.
What they haven't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas, or working inside all the time.
Take it out of this room.
That, in my view, gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world.
Climate change cannot be solved in one country, but has got to be solved by the world working together.
If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York or starts in the sub-prime market of the United States of America.
The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery.
The number one organ of ridicule, nowadays, is the newspaper.
I think the Western tradition shows us one glorious alternative, which is tragedy.
He is not a loser, though he has lost.
Nonsense. You can't have it all. You can't.
And I was looking around and I found this wonderful picture.
If a computer speech recognition system is able to recognize what you're saying, then it spells it out.
And basically to ask the questions: What if art was aware that we were looking at it?
How could it respond, in a way, to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we're looking at it?
I say almost every aspect, because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on.
I say almost every aspect, because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on.
We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass, or to chase after animals, or to free our hands for weapons.
You've believed it through generations.
You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it, relying on it to be as solid as a rock.
If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.
He knew all about that kind of science.
And he called it hypothesis-free science.
We have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over: nothing in the least like that in any other primate.
Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver, and you can see that, compared with gorilla, we are halfway to being shaped like a fish.
Everybody likes the aquatic theory.
Take a look at this picture.
So as other countries in the world innovated, in the sense both of developing newer technologies, but also developing newer rules, the Chinese were cut off from those advances.
It plots income, average income in China as a percentage of average income in the United States.
We can go do it over and over again.
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule.
There's an old saying, "Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it's not there."
Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished.
And from there I was watching this little world.
And then he said, "But I don't believe that you can do this." So I said, "OK."
The instrument that I used turned into a catapult.
But this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt.
Audience: No.
Audience: No.
And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful, because the paint starts to turn into little blobs.
And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse.
So I broke the needle.
That ship there, that's made from 24-karat gold.
And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider.
As you can see, dressage.
But I got to thinking, you know, if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.
That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.
There you go Chris.
Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.
It'll last for 6,000 liters.
Instead of shipping water, and using man-made processes to do it, let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.
And where do people live? Near water.
So, by thinking differently, and processing water at the point of use, mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water.
They're the people who make the bullet train.
There are many many ways that nature filters water that takes salt out of water.
This beetle, unlike this chip bag here, this beetle uses one material, chitin.
And it finds many many ways to put many functions into it.
It's strong and resilient.
One of the big ideas, one of the big projects I've been honored to work on is a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it.
It's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world, telling my story in form of a book.
So it's taken me 232 days.
The key is to overcome what's called functional fixedness.
You look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks.
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.
Rewards, by their very nature, narrow our focus, concentrate the mind; that's why they work in so many cases.
Management did not emanate from nature.
Management is not a tree, it's a television set.
Somebody invented it.
And the idea was, it was supposed to be able to transfer power anywhere on Earth.
Imagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers, there's a capacitor attached to it too.
And if you can bring another device close enough to the source, that will only work at exactly that frequency, you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple, and transfer magnetic energy between them.
And if you can bring another device close enough to the source, that will only work at exactly that frequency, you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple, and transfer magnetic energy between them.
We live in a magnetic field.
And Nokia as well.
And Nokia as well.
Because what you see here, what you see here is the flat world of Thomas Friedman, isn't it.
It changed like this.
Probably the world will do this.
The United States has not been so eager to use MDG 4.
The United States has not been so eager to use MDG 4.
They have a very high level. It's coming down.
Don't make it Africa. Don't make it a race issue.
In 2007, Zero launched a green campaign, suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m.
It's a human and technological revolution.
It's motion and emotion.
It's information.
It's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial.
It's conceptual. It's universal. It's beyond words and numbers.
I used to have a list of these extinct apples, and when I would go out and give a presentation, I would pass the list out in the audience.
This book was published in 1904.
I don't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us, but ...
So it's not necessary, thank God, that the Fowler apple is the best apple in the world.
It's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good, unique trait.
I don't know. Can fish play the piano?
You don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear, but it's very important diversity.
Norway owns the mountain and the facility, but the depositors own the seed.
But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now, which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population.
And although that was great for the music business at the time, it wasn't much good for anything else.
What it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social.
It's already immersed in social networks.
But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today and how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago, just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France.
We were naturally deferential. We needed hierarchy.
But I do think we're on the verge of a period when, just as happened to the monarchy and, interestingly, the military too, the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end, and it's going to steadily move to the sides, the margins of our society, transformed from being a master into a servant, a servant to the productive economy and of human needs.
And as that happens, we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism, which is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks, it's not a self-sufficient system.
And our human nature isn't just selfish, it's also compassionate.
The crisis is almost certainly deepening around us.
But consider for a moment that sound does have form.
Well, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that's all they had.
Now we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram.
You should hear some of the phone conversations that I have with people on my Bluetooth in the shop.
It's that shape because the helium has to expand.
Now just to give you some perspective of this balloon, the little black dots are people.
That's the U.S. Air Force Museum.
That suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars.
Art, of course, looks at the world through the psyche, the emotions -- the unconscious at times -- and of course the aesthetic.
In this project, we're specifically interested, of course, in ice.
Now, one bit of science before we get into the visuals.
Earth is having a fever.
If you look in the middle background, you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo-yo.
This is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center.
And on up to Greenland.
The interior of Greenland is to the right.
This glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past 15 years.
I'm certain that we can.
You're an elite audience. You get it.
And the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7.
And I had to visualize the swim.
And I remember then getting out of the shower and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands.
I had never seen black water before.
First, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich that's really his.
But it's not quite like the adult brain.
Now she thinks the powder is sugar.
And in fact, they say she deserves more blame in this case, the failed attempt to harm, than in another case, which we call an accident.
And we do have such a tool.
The whole research program here of studying the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new.
Now organized crime has been around for a very long time, I hear you say, and these would be wise words, indeed.
But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP.
Now, organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business.
It has zones of production, like Afghanistan and Columbia.
Now, coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone, in almost every laptop and games console.
This boat is worth one million Euros when it's new.
I expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus, one of the very great worldwide viruses that came.
It doesn't really work in this context.
We keep our office almost like an archive of architectural biodiversity.
We scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions, and went to China.
You can try it.
One slightly silly thing that's invisible is this story, which is invisible to you.
And on the photograph, he wrote with a flourish, "To Horse Face, with love from Geoffrey Dickens, M.P."
Gravity is one thing that we can't see and which we don't understand.
It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest.
In the Sufi faith, this great Middle Eastern religion, which some claim is the route of all religions, Sufi masters are all telepaths, so they say.
But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.
Another thing we can't see is the human genome.
Time, nobody can see time.
I don't know if you know this. Modern physics, there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient for the figures.
Gas was invented in 1600 by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont.
You can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum, if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes, you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists will disagree with this.
The point, most of us. What's the point?
Charles Lullin, the grandfather, saw hundreds of different figures, different landscapes of all sorts.
There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons.
So that's one reason to think that we might be declensionists, going in the wrong direction.
The Internet has no business plan, never did.
It's more like a mosh pit.
Imagine, you being part of a network where, you're maybe at a sporting event, and you're sitting in rows like this, and somebody asks for a beer, and it gets handed at the aisle.
This is how Internet addressing and routing actually work.
Something is up in Pakistan."
You know, it's just like the hail goes out and people are ready to help.
But now, Wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work.
And Wikipedia has embraced this.
And to this day, the page for Star Wars Kid has a warning right at the top that says you are not to put his real name on the page.
This is my favorite goofy blog: Catsthatlooklikehitler.com.
In the real world, we see filtering of this sort taking place in Pakistan.
So, my urging, my thought, is that the Internet isn't just a pile of information.
But this is rarely a good sign. Right?
So the more you block it, the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship and thus win in this cat-and-mouse game.
Rarely hear about cyber hedonism, for example, how people are becoming passive.
So for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran, there may as well be two digital captives who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft.
If you look at some of the surveys on how the young people actually benefit from the Internet, you'll see that the number of teenagers in China, for example, for whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life, is three times more than in the United States.
Okay, so 90 percent of my photographic process is, in fact, not photographic.
Photography threatens fantasy.
They didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs, and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth.
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes, but what I came away with is a photograph.
I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.
Now I'm going to move on to another project I did.
And for the men in these photographs, photography had been used to create a fantasy.
Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait.
Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty, how best we release their energies.
Patient capital works between, and tries to take the best of both.
Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk, a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment, to use the market as the best listening device that we have, and the expectation of below-market returns, but outsized social impact.
The first one was miniaturization.
The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest, or else they wouldn't take the risk.
This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty, led by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.
Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.
The reason is Kurdistan.
It has no choice but to behave.
Why is it all he's talking about is oil?"
Before it was, how do we control their oil?
Now it's their oil for their own purposes.
Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.
Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world, to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses working on small things.
The first of those is that design is human-centered.
Designs were refined and developed with 150 older people and their families before the service was launched earlier this year.
Look into your own heart, discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever, to inflict that pain on anybody else.
Education because we've so dropped out of compassion.
But of course you don't understand compassion if you're just going to think about it.
Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope of Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.
And we have a cool atmosphere.
I run a design studio in New York.
Then there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table.
And then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.
So then it became quite easy.
And the whole series of work came out of it.
And the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between, "Should I really take as much money as I can?
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?"
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?"
We just read the back of a label on a packet.
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.
So instead of trusting it, we fear it.
It's a greenhouse, where kids get told all about food and growing their own food.
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.
It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."
I don't know anybody.
But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four, which is great, to Stage Five?
And so, I began to realize that my American roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story, as had a professor, who once told me that my novel was not "authentically African."
It is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power.
There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world, and it is "nkali."
Like our economic and political worlds, stories too are defined by the principle of nkali: How they are told, who tells them, when they're told, how many stories are told, are really dependent on power.
The consequence of the single story is this: It robs people of dignity.
It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult.
Here was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians, who were not supposed to be readers.
Or about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail, but continue to nurse ambition?
And I'll tell you -- don't look anywhere else -- I'll tell you what's happening in your head.
Your brain is learning, and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination; the left side of its visual field is under green illumination.
And yet there is still one on a dark surround, and one on a light surround. Why?
So, here we have -- let's turn this around -- a diamond.
And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to hold it here, and I'm going to spin it.
Move your eyes around, blink, maybe close one eye.
Yes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?
Keep blinking. Every time you blink, it will switch.
The senses aren't fragile. And if they were, we wouldn't be here.
Instead, color tells us something completely different, that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is.
Take this place for example.
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.
On the inside it's a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house.
So, while this space represents someone's profession, this one certainly represents a passion.
And on my weekends I would go up, just like all the other tourists, to the top of the Empire State Building, and I'd look down on this landscape, on these ecosystems, and I'd wonder, "How does this landscape work to make habitat for plants and animals?
Those are two students at King's College -- later Columbia University -- sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.
And it's this map you see here.
This map isn't from Hudson's time, but from the American Revolution, 170 years later, made by British military cartographers during the occupation of New York City.
And it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew.
And I thought to myself, "You know, if I could georeference this map, if I could place this map in the grid of the city today, I could find these lost features of the city, in the block-by-block geography that people know, the geography of where people go to work, and where they go to live, and where they like to eat."
And even though I've only had a brief time to speak, I hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place.
The place that you see here on the left side was interconnected. It was based on this diversity.
One, the perception of people, and two, the natural interface, the natural form of the interface, so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot.
And we're getting this mass-manufactured.
We specked it out to actually be doable with a very, very low-cost bill of materials, so that it can become a childhood companion for kids.
And I particularly remember a really good speech by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.
Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...
So he tried plan B.
We invented the whole lot of them.
Now, the reason I show you Pernod -- it's only one example.
Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod.
Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod.
The second reason is, we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever, and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge into a working model.
The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon is simply because our perceptual bubble does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers.
We make a decision it's that big, even though it's not that big.
He's at home having tea.
"Can the brain build such a perception?"
Is it capable of doing it?
So, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain.
It had to improve it a little bit.
Now, the circuit, you could also think of as the fabric of the brain.
And we think this is species-specific, which means that that could explain why we can't communicate across species.
So, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do is you have to make this come alive.
But we can ask, "Where is the rose?"
We can ask, "Where is it inside, if we stimulate it with a picture?"
Where is it inside the neocortex?
Over the next five minutes, my intention is to transform your relationship with sound.
Just a word on music. Music is the most powerful sound there is, often inappropriately deployed.
And what they found out is when that was available for public record, the people's electricity usage in those communities dropped.
So, when we look at this and we step back, what I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real.
And that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face.
And these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character.
And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination, the red and the green and the blue, diffuse the light differently, we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer.
I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.
The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.
So the big question for us is, "How do we manage this technological change?"
So forget about retirements if you're young.
Or so we should hope.
Our connection to reality is never just perception.
Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything.
That myth is testable.
If the ancient Greeks had found out about seasons in Australia, they could have easily varied their myth to predict that.
So, being proved wrong by observation, and changing their theory accordingly, still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks one jot closer to understanding seasons, because their explanation was bad: easy to vary.
This is not sustainable.
This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living.
It is able to move around its environment.
It can follow chemical gradients.
This is a violent process.
Now a block of limestone, in itself, isn't particularly that interesting.
Would it give this block of limestone new properties?
Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.
So, here is the technology we have today.
Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.
But perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.
But if you ever meet one, engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.
Now, symmetry is almost nature's language.
And it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well.
And I think Galileo summed up, very nicely, the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us.
Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in "The Magic Mountain."
For Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann, which was something still and deathly -- for Galois, symmetry was all about motion.
For Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann, which was something still and deathly -- for Galois, symmetry was all about motion.
Let's take the twisted six-pointed starfish.
What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?
What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?
Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn, and still it looks like it did before I started.
I could rotate it by a third of a turn, or a half a turn, or put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn.
And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn.
Now, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry.
Can anybody think what else I could do to this which would leave it like I did before I started?
I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I?
It's got no reflective symmetry.
It's got no reflective symmetry.
But now this has some reflectional symmetry.
I can reflect it in the line through X, or the line through Y, or the line through Z.
So both of these objects have six symmetries.
The combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different.
And you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on.
You can prove, using Galois' language, there are actually only 17 different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra.
So, like Galois, I stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you, and I've got a picture of it here.
And this thing -- species die away, and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode -- but this mathematical object will live forever.
If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.
What does this compassion entail?
It entails understanding the pain of the other.
It means it gets filled with hot air.
God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"
He goes in there, and it's not there.
Every week, the cleaner would come. "God you've answered my plea again."
It cannot be consciously a contributor.
It is helpless.
It doesn't know how to survive, even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.
It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.
That implies the trusted person won't violate the trust.
As the child grows, it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust.
It doesn't know even the word "violation."
Therefore, it has to blame itself, a wordless blame, which is more difficult to really resolve -- the wordless self-blame.
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.
There's no American compassion.
It transcends nation, the gender, the age.
Why? Because it is there in everybody.
It's experienced by people occasionally.
There's no choice in this: that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you, cannot be minus you.
If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many.
That is where you fake.
You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.
So, we sucked up.
Talk about a picture of compassion.
I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while, and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world, and we can do that together."
That's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.
We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself.
So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?
How do you make it real?
We are one people together.
When he says, "I am the spirit, and I am the way," and when the prophet Muhammad said, "Whoever has seen me has seen God," it is because they became so much an instrument of God, they became part of God's team -- so that God's will was manifest through them, and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos.
For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other, because the knowledge of truth is within every human being.
And as he's leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge.
Again, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.
And there, in the town, he's approached by a dog who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries, even in America, I think, in some areas -- and he's looking just terrible.
So, he had a brilliant idea.
It's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion.
And I'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story, which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature.
Because it's important to the atmospheric system, we go to all lengths to study this thing.
So, as you can imagine, the inside of this aircraft doesn't look like any plane you would take on vacation.
So, I started this exploration around eight years back, and it literally started with a mouse on my desk.
But you can also search in the digital world, or maybe you can write a query, saying, "What is Dr. Smith's address?"
Rather than typing a keyword to find something, I put my objects on top of it.
Many of you already must have thought, OK, you can browse.
Culture is a reaction to nature, and this understanding of our ancestors is transmitted generation from generation in the form of stories, symbols and rituals, which are always indifferent to rationality.
What a waste of a life."
And that brings us to the mythology of business.
You see, this is what India is today. The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view.
But belief is not measurable.
That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters, behavior will happen, business will happen.
And governments have not been able to provide clean water.
And as for outsiders, white, black or brown, tar and feather them, and whip them out of town.
It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean.
Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership seems to me terribly archaic.
If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman or an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.
In fact, so woeful was our telephone service that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.
And it was a hot day and he said, "Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?"
The same is true, of course -- we don't have time for too many more examples -- but it's true of our music, of our dance, of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.
Governments aren't very good at telling stories.
That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.
And the consensus is of a very simple principle, that in a diverse plural democracy like India you don't really have to agree on everything all the time, so long as you agree on the ground rules of how you will disagree.
Actually this creature is the result of the Penfield research.
He named it homunculus.
So, of course, homunculus is definitely not a freak.
It's you. It's me.
Unfortunately it doesn't explain why so many designers remain mainly interested in designing chairs.
And it really helps me to understand how we see, how we hear, how we breathe, how our brain can inform or mislead us.
And this noise is the most neutral.
If you make some noise you can feel the effect.
And the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object, for sure, but creates the idea of an eye sensibility of the object.
So the idea is, all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself, including air and molecules, for sure.
And almost a kind of poltergeist effect.
In coal mines, this canary was supposed to be close to the miners.
And the plants will filter, by the roots, the dirty water of the fish.
After that you have two options.
So, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.
But, at the time, in the 13th century, it was the gadget of the day.
It was the world's first popular computer.
He would know where things would fit in the sky.
He would not only know what time it was, he would also know where the sun would rise, and how it would move across the sky.
They read the textbook twice, or three times or four times.
But I will start with a historical background.
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here.
But I want to tell you a different story here today.
We had stories like "The Seven-League Boots": the giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on, with every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles, a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal.
It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it.
This is Lewes in Sussex, who have recently launched the Lewes Pound, a currency that you can only spend within the town, as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.
This is Lewes in Sussex, who have recently launched the Lewes Pound, a currency that you can only spend within the town, as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.
I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.
But let us honor what it has bought us, and move forward from this point.
And yet desertification is a major threat on all continents, affecting some 110 countries and about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands.
Here I am -- I'm the second person on the left --  with the elders in Gidan-Kara, a tiny village outside of Sokoto.
This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things.
It adds roughness to the dune's surface, to the texture of the dune's surface, binding the grains.
And I'm going to only talk about the mass.
So, in that sense, it's a very simple object.
This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.
So why is it so important?
Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.
And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.
An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state of a really massive star's life.
And if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy; what we see is the star light.
And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used the world's largest telescope.
And that is because of the atmosphere.
Absolutely my favorite star in the world.
To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.
And what does the big black hole do?
It strips that gas cloud apart.
Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms, but here they will care properly.
And the water will go where it should go.
You can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.
It can envy many municipalities, the color, the taste, the purity of this water.
In many portions, water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything.
You won't find water in this slide.
Somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here.
These statues, marvelous statues, gives you an idea of water table.
But the nearest would be "glory," a reputation.
And perhaps they knew the future also.
It was designed some 150 years ago.
If the water table goes down, you will find new stairs.
I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet that's been folded just once.
The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle.
And he had never appeared in public since that point.
She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned.
So they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surgery, are counseled, and then there are buses waiting, which will transport them to the base hospital.
Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd.
There is an animated series in the works.
Once, for example, I was interviewing this part-timer from the Red Brigades.
This man was very drunk, and he was very interested in my camera, until he noticed the women, who handled him with smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course.
However, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel.
And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.
And the way it works is, it comes from the southwest.
And this is called the Globe Skimmer, or Wandering Glider.
And, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world.
It lives throughout the tropics, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.
It lives throughout the tropics, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.
And it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it.
But it really hasn't been studied very much.
This is, it seems a bit dull you know.
But I'm not going to talk about that.
Another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains, the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone.
But wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west.
That's the inter-monsoon, the time when the monsoon changes.
Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon.
And that front in the middle is not vertical, it's at an angle.
But they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species, it can fly for thousands of kilometers.
When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.
Ralph Waldo Emerson described language as "fossil poetry."
My experiences over the last 18 months, as a lawyer, has seeded in me a new entrepreneurial idea, which I believe is indeed worth spreading.
The target market is as tempting as it can get.
I do realize that the fight for justice against corruption is never easy.
What gives us the courage?
Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees, but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.
The trickiness about the reaction is that tritium doesn't exist in nature.
Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion.
And we get within about the same price as current electricity.
It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion.
But if I show you this picture it's not to tell you how happy we were.
I thought, well, the 20th century, that was brilliant.
And this is when the project Solar Impulse really started to turn in my head.
Cockpit, propeller, engine.
Just the fuselage here, it's so light.
And one month ago we have unveiled it.
So, you see that this airplane is more a symbol.
And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world.
Because it's as though this neuron is adopting the other person's point of view.
So, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian, instead of Darwinian.
A polar bear, to evolve a coat, will take thousands of generations, maybe 100,000 years.
But the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day.
And what's really interesting is, if you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused.
And what's really interesting is, if you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused.
And should that pig have grown, unfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead after I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway.
And the door to my X-ray room is made of lead and steel.
The coloring, so coloring adds another level to the X-rays.
That flower doesn't come in bright orange, I don't think.
It has human connotations.
The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize, but also it looks like it's a robot, and it comes from a sci-fi genus.
I will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds, I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem.
Look at this monster.
It's so basic. It just grows wild.
It's so basic. It just grows wild.
So the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners.
So, I've taken it apart, component by component, months and months and months of work.
I love that word.
A few of the strategies we observed: they eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.
Instead there is one word that imbues your entire life, and that word is "ikigai."
It's not only because we like to drink lots of it, and its marvelous derivatives, beer, wine, etc.
This first encounter was kind of like the Maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior.
Even though it grows to 20 feet long, since it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings.
The Chambal, if you look at it, has clear water.
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.
So, on August 15th, again, Independence Day, 2009, empowered with the same process, we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."
From the rulebook: Nomenclature is a tool.
By the way, that's a natural picture of Saturn, no adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful.
So, you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture, so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like.
They stole our flag! They stole our flag!"
Bode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus.
But originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world.
We take the cells, we expand them, we place the cells on the scaffold, and we then place the scaffold back into the patient.
But actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient, we actually exercise it.
But actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient, we actually exercise it.
We coat the outside with these muscle cells.
And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy.
We actually take the donor liver, we use very mild detergents, and we, by using these mild detergents, we take all the cells out of the liver.
Why? Because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want.
A windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell.
So, these are very tough technologies.
The architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb.
Now, that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time.
The second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house.
And again, this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built, but at least suggests the ideas.
That's an enormous benefit.
Here it is in an end stage configuration.
What I want to talk about today is this particular cell, or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.
And I want to call it the girl cell.
And it is essential to balance, to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us.
And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom, and that vulnerability is our greatest strength, and that emotions have inherent logic, which lead to radical, appropriate, saving action.
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell.
And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said, "Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby?
So, seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house in Narok, Kenya, in the Masai land.
I want to close today with a new piece from my book.
And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here.
And I want to do it for Sunitha.
And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday, the girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else.
I know that one kiss could take away all my decision-making ability.
The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life, its only job is to grow.
You can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time, after which you simply reheat the pouch.
On Medicaid -- if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid, or if you have health insurance -- insulin is pretty straightforward.
Adherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day?
Now, the model is intuitively right.
It just doesn't happen to be right about the world.
There's a great show on American television that you have to watch.
"I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests."
You can be safe because when you're hit, you survive, or you can be safe because you avoid accidents.
It's also painful.
Now, you may think to yourself, "Well, if my eyes depended on it, you know, I would obviously use it every day."
You just gotta carry this thing around.
I think this tells us there is an opportunity.
See what's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile, to me, is that the first 999 miles are all about science.
This is a report about a drug called lithium.
So, I said, "Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder."
So, we couldn't run a clinical trial, we couldn't figure it out.
Those little lines? That's the power.
The rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world -- poor resources, a rigorous environment, a series of problems in lightweight, and things of this kind -- and also not so different from the home healthcare and diagnostic system world.
Why do we choose paper?
There's an example of the same thing on a finger, showing you basically what it looks like.
They'll make, we estimate that if you were to run them 24 hours a day they'd make about 10 million tests a year.
You can't manipulate it very well, although I'll show something about that in a moment.
They're everywhere, six billion a month in India.
It measures the absorption of light in a sample The neat thing about this is, you have light source that flickers on and off at about 1,000 hertz, another light source that detects that light at 1,000 hertz, and so you can run this system in broad daylight.
It performs about equivalently to a system that's in the order of 100,000 dollars.
It performs about equivalently to a system that's in the order of 100,000 dollars.
So, as an aside, I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early.
Because evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children.
Why is it hard to treat?
Because it's heterogeneous, and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer.
But, if we start to understand that cancer isn't just a molecular defect, it's something more, then we'll get to new ways of treating it, as I'll show you.
What's exciting is that over the last two or three years, the government has spent 400 million dollars, and they've allocated another billion dollars, to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project.
You know, if I measured your temperature over 30 days, and I asked, "What was the average temperature?"
Earlier it was referred to this direct life device.
You know, I've been using it for two and a half months.
They had gotten their chemotherapy, and then they randomized them, where half got placebo, and half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone.
She goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway, and again, I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system, in the cancer, but it targeted a pathway, and a month later, pow, that cancer's gone.
What's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada, where it's "more ethical to give placebos."
I can redeem this painting, just continuing on, doing layers upon layers.
TS: As it turns out, this device kind of comes in handy, because I don't have to have the fine motor skills to do, that I can operate slides, which is more of a mental process.
TS: Nature is -- well, it's a godsend.
Let me give you an example: a huge power project, 300 million dollars, to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful, areas of western Kenya.
And we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits: It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there, nobody was interested in irrigation projects.
So everybody knew this is a, not a useless project, this is an absolute damaging, a terrible project -- not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars, and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools, like hospitals and so on.
In Germany, foreign bribery was allowed.
Think about smoking.
They have scissors in the classroom, but knives and forks? No.
And the way I look at it is: If you don't have knives and forks in your school, you're purely endorsing, from a state level, fast food, because it's handheld.
JO: What do you think this is? Child: I don't know.
I know the ins and outs of those ingredients.
But the home needs to start passing on cooking again, for sure.
For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.
And for me, it's quite romantic, but it's about if one person teaches three people how to cook something, and they teach three of their mates, that only has to repeat itself 25 times, and that's the whole population of America.
Suddenly, you have the big, strong, central state.
And this is so obvious, in a way, because you think about how all of you have changed the way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done.
And I think an even more wonderful speech, which I'm going to read a big chunk of, which sums up what I said at the beginning about believing there is more to life than money, and more that we should try and measure than money.
It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate.
It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.
And each one of those is really kind of summing up the most important things for the United States at that time.
I actually did research to find out the first use of the word "technology."
I actually did research to find out the first use of the word "technology."
How much learning can you do?
And fire was used to clear out, and again, affected the ecology of grass and whole continents, and was used in cooking.
It enabled us to actually eat all kinds of things.
And the three major phases of the early universe was energy, when the dominant force was energy; then it became, the dominant force, as it cooled, became matter; and then, with the invention of life, four billion years ago, the dominant force in our neighborhood became information.
We actually don't know.
For instance, right now, three-quarters of the energy that we use is actually used to feed the technium itself.
A bacterium, which has no consciousness at all, wants to move towards light.
It has an urge, and technology has an urge.
So, technology is selfish; technology is generous.
But a better way is to, what I call proactionary principle, which is: You engage with technology.
And when it diverts from what you want, we prioritize risk, we evaluate not just the new stuff, but the old stuff.
We fix it, but most importantly, we relocate it.
So, technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket.
It's more than just gadgets; it's more than just things that people invent.
But reliable estimates range between 60 billion and 200 billion dollars per year.
And how has this system of law worked for government?
But the challenge here is not one of just amending the law, because the hurdle for success is trust.
Life is complicated enough without legal fear.
Worked pretty well for 200 years.
Law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices.
Law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices.
If they can't internalize it, they won't trust it.
If the environmental agency can't decide that the power lines are good for the environment, then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms to the city.
This is AirStrip Technologies.
And this sends a signal and it creates a body area network to a gateway.
Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway, as today many of these things are dedicated gateways, because they are not so well integrated.
Now, I have this device on.
I didn't want to take my shirt off to show you, but I can tell you it's on.
I hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better -- I hope so.
However you have to put in most of this stuff.
Almost 24 million people have diabetes.
And the thing is, the normal brain ignores the details.
And actually it's called "Temple Grandin," not "Thinking In Pictures."
I was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face.
So that's the personal reason.
Prakash, as many of you know, is the Sanskrit word for light, and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children, we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience.
That's the hospital we're working with in Delhi, the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital.
His visual-motor coordination is quite poor, but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out.
The one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information.
When we saw that, we asked: Could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath, of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism?
But I wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut, because I was painting it from my gut.
And that's exactly what cricket has done.
The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.
But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket, which was, all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball, and any number of people could play it anywhere.
Take a look: You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there, you could play it in a little alley -- you couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall; don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.
And we won this World Cup in 1983.
England invented 20 overs cricket, and said, "The world must play 20 overs cricket."
The accident, of course, there, was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast.
And thankfully for all of us, the English are very good at inventing things, and then the gracious people that they are, they let the world become very good at it.
Because cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.
The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.
We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.
Right so, finally, an English game that India usurped a little bit, but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.
So that's what T20 is doing.
L'il C: I tell them to create a ball, and then you just use that ball of energy.
And instead of throwing it out, people would think that's a krump move, that's a krump move.
And you let it go, and then right when you see the tail, you grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in.
Let's now spin the world during the same year.
Here focusing in on Haiti.
This is January, in time lapse, of people editing ... that's the earthquake.
Discount that back to the present, at five percent: over two million dollars for a stop sign, in each direction.
OK, this is Mount Everest.
OK, this is the route up Everest.
This is a view looking up the icefall, the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp.
And here's a picture in the icefall; it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly, and it actually changes every day.
You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.
If you notice, the summit of Everest is black.
You can see his hand is completely white; his face, his nose, is burned.
A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.
And this precise oxygen concentration, 10 parts per million, that caused suspended animation, is conserved.
And this particular cave was Lechuguilla, and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans.
The researchers had to suit up just to enter it.
And so we thought, like in a game of musical chairs, might we be able to give a person some hydrogen sulfide, and might it be able to occupy that place like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind?
We try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees by actually burning more oxygen.
So, it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse when it was also cold because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold.
It stopped moving.
I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.
I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.
I founded a company called Ikaria with others' help.
If you think about the phone -- and Intel has tested a lot of the things I'm going to show you, in about 600 elderly households -- 300 in Ireland, and 300 in Portland -- trying to understand: How do we measure and monitor behavior in a medically meaningful way?
Andy Grove, about six or seven years ago, he doesn't even know or remember this, in a Fortune Magazine article he used the phrase "mainframe healthcare," and I've been extending and expanding this.
We're doing 15-minute exams with patients.
But there is no goal within this health reform.
How do we set a going-to-the-moon goal of dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming?
And I would think, "Daddy, how far does the universe go?"
But I can go on about telling you how we evolve stories, and how stories effectively are who we are and how these get translated into the particular discipline that I am in, which is film.
Resolution is something that is far more limited.
Now, it's generally understood that questions of morality -- questions of good and evil and right and wrong -- are questions about which science officially has no opinion.
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife, in this life, his personality -- his rather unfortunate personality -- is the product of his brain.
The concept of physical health is undefined.
People will send you donations when you're in that condition.
Now, if you're going to play good chess, a principle like, "Don't lose your Queen," is very good to follow.
So, this, I think, is what the world needs now.
Mars is half the size of the Earth, but because two-thirds of the Earth is covered by water, the land area on Mars is comparable to the land area on Earth.
And the result of our meeting was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES.
And that's a critical area of national security and economic vitality, to make sure we produce the next generation of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists.
The problem is the spacecraft's largest diameter is nine feet; ARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long.
How do we get it to Mars?
This is over Tilamook, Oregon.
We are prepared to fly this on Mars, rewrite the textbook about Mars.
It's real slavery in exactly the same way that slavery would be recognized throughout all of human history.
What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable into a slave, is the absence of the rule of law.
Though I enjoyed watching your jaws drop, drop, drop, until you got it.
Slavery, illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society.
Slavery, illegal in every country has been pushed to the edges of our global society.
The vocabulary used in those books and the style of writing.
We had 25 mothers who came regularly after school to study.
And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here.
And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here.
One publisher, Action Publishing, was willing to take that leap and trust me, and to listen to what I had to say.
They published my first book, "Flying Fingers," you see it here.
But it is changing the equation of what's rational in sexual decision-making.
They proceed to tell me a story which comes down to basically the following. We have used such advanced technologies now and made them available in the most remote places that we put soldiers: hills of Afghanistan, Iraq ...
No, the guy says, "We're going to bring a guy into this conference room, and wearing the arm you're going to give us, he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape off this table.
Great he needs efferent, afferent, haptic response sensors.
I said, "I'll tell you what. I'll build you an arm that's under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year.
And now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for.
Wilbur and Orville.
I think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary."
I'm just going to show you how the robot works.
What you see over here, this is what we want to do next.
We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion.
And it deploys legs -- it looks almost like "Star Wars" -- when it lands, it absorbs the shock and starts walking.
So, it's a wheel-leg hybrid robot.
So, in this video we're using an approach called the reactive approach.
Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet, it's trying to walk over a changing terrain, a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes.
And just by the tactile information, it successfully crosses over these type of terrain.
So, this is CLIMBeR.
So, what it does, it has three legs. It's probably difficult to see, but it has a winch and a cable at the top -- and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot.
And then once it figures that out in real time, it calculates the force distribution: how much force it needs to exert to the surface so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.
And they already had a six legged robot called LEMUR.
The students like to have fun. And here you can see that it's walking over unstructured terrain.
We store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move.
We do something to something And just like magic, it moves. The blob.
It takes really a lot of time and it's expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm.
And thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.
And the goal of RoboCup, the actual goal is, by the year 2050 we want to have full size, autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human World Cup champions and win.
And the goal of RoboCup, the actual goal is, by the year 2050 we want to have full size, autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human World Cup champions and win.
Every day in the morning, the first thing I do before my first cup of coffee, before I brush my teeth, I open my notebook.
But pollen forensics can be very subtle.
The next poem is "If No One Ever Marries Me."
One was his daughter, Laurence.
A few years before he died, after he had resumed writing poetry, but in secret, he confessed to a friend in a letter that I found when I was doing my research: "I've written a verse.
And the poem is called, "Spring and Fall."
In fact, these images became the voices of protest themselves.
After all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world, there's one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still, much more than the others.
And they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room.
And so, like many people, we start with a house on a lot, and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom.
So first, we demolish it.
We then put in plumbing, and insulate.
And so the question is: How could we make that back?
And the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes, birds of every flavor.
And I reached down and picked him up, and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.
So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him, so I put him down.
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away, and at that time I could actually focus that close; now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.
Anyway, there we were, staring at each other, and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system, and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.
And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart, magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps, and you're looking land -- new land -- being created right before your eyes.
And this whole ecosystem wasn't even known about until 33 years ago.
And it completely threw science on its head.
It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth; it looks like aliens in an alien environment.
And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck," and go and work on the other side of the island.
Five years later, come back, and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it; enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay, and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay, and the bay recovered.
The brilliant playwright, Adrienne Kennedy, wrote a volume called "People Who Led to My Plays."
In 1994, when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum, I made an exhibition called Black Male.
It looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art.
This exhibition included over 20 artists of various ages and races, but all looking at black masculinity from a very particular point of view.
And in the course of the exhibition -- which was contentious, controversial and ultimately, for me, life-changing in my sense of what art could be -- a woman came up to me on the gallery floor to express her concern about the nature of how powerful images could be and how we understood each other.
Their works for me are about, not always just simply about the aesthetic innovation that their minds imagine, that their visions create and put out there in the world, but more, perhaps, importantly, through the excitement of the community that they create as important voices that would allow us right now to understand our situation, as well as in the future.
It's considering what it means for these artists to be both out in the world as their work travels, but in their communities as people who are seeing and thinking about the issues that face us.
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet.
But you don't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean to see a light show like this.
Well, that was the question that 19th century French physiologist Raphael Dubois, asked about this bioluminescent clam.
He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals; one, the enzyme, he called luciferase; the substrate, he called luciferin after Lucifer the Lightbearer.
Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators by staying in the darkness, light can still be very useful for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive: and that's find food, attract a mate and avoid being eaten.
So, for example, this fish has a built-in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate.
Now, this one is blue, and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean because evolution has selected for the color that travels farthest through seawater in order to optimize communication.
So, most animals make blue light, and most animals can only see blue light, but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs.
And I have no idea why there's two, and that's something I want to solve some day -- but not only can it see blue light, but it can see red light.
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen.
This little guy has no visible means of self-support.
And there are a lot of different animals that can do this: There's jellyfish, there's squid, there's a whole lot of different crustaceans, there's even fish that can do this.
For this fish, it's actually whole cells with nuclei and membranes.
This jellyfish, for example, has a spectacular bioluminescent display.
So now we had a system that we could actually take to some place that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean that might be patrolled by large predators.
We depend on the fact that audiences, such as yourselves, will make assumptions.
We depend on the fact that audiences, such as yourselves, will make assumptions.
It's a beard trimmer, you see?
It's a beard trimmer, you see?
First question: If I want to ask them to call up -- because they do hear them through the ear.
Where is the will?
She doesn't bring any useful information to us.
Now that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about.
Now, we've offered this carrot, as I say, we've dangled the carrot.
Well, unfortunately, I've got so many Viagra ads coming at me, your email is lost.
Paragraph number three: When animals are attacked or cornered, they will fight to the death, so you have to give them an exit.
We are harangued, lectured to, sold, marketed, but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication.
Their repertoire includes the Croatian national anthem, a Bosnian love song and Serbian duets.
And, Leah adds with a grin, "Kavita, we especially are proud of our Christmas music, because it shows we are open to religious practices even though Catholic Church hates us LGBT."

So I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea.
Actually, I think it'll eventually be seen as probably the single biggest idea that's emerged in the past century.
But there's actually a lot more to computation than that.
You get something a little bit more complicated.
Okay. Let's zoom out again.
If the rules for the universe are simple, it's kind of inevitable that they have to be very abstract and very low level; operating, for example, far below the level of space or time, which makes it hard to represent things.
And I'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is.
My watermaker broke, only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.
And this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance.
But it does. Generally, we haven't got ourselves into this mess through big disasters.
And it rests on a complexity, which has some characteristics very different from those that my friend Benoit Mandelbrot discussed, but are very interesting.
So, there are two ways of thinking about this word, I think.
We academics -- I am an academic -- we love complexity.
And it's like the traffic that you see.
Or I'm going to use simple to mean reliable, predictable, repeatable.
And I'm going to use as an example the Internet, because it's a particularly good example of stacked simplicity.
And I'm going to use as an example the Internet, because it's a particularly good example of stacked simplicity.
We call it a complex system, which it is, but it's also something else.
You can catch errors with it, it's unambiguous in its reading, there are lots of good things about binary.
A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch.
Which, in this simple portal makes the claim that it makes accessible all of the world's information.
And I don't want to spend your time in going through the details, but in the lower right-hand corner, you see an example of the kind of thing that we have.
It's a little paper chip.
That we know how to eradicate poverty, we just need to do more?
We need that kind of information, we need more of it, and then we need to guide policy.
So now, I started from the big problem, and I couldn't answer it.
And the problem of poverty is not like that.
About three and a half years ago, I made a discovery.
About three and a half years ago, I made a discovery.
Here's our new law firm: We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients, we always perform for our clients.
It just doesn't drive behavior.
Sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures, and they say, "I know what all the facts and details say, but it just doesn't feel right."
The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.
They've never made money.
And when they went IPO, their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10.
"I believe, I believe, I believe," he told people.
And I ended up in Jamaica, in the West Indies, where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary, structurally, that I ever saw in my life.
And this picture here, it's really interesting, it shows two things: First of all, it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far, and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s, you took pictures in black and white.
A book was written about it.
The green revolution, all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it.
I started looking at my own work: The work that I had done for the previous 10 years, almost every time, had instances of knowledge that people had shared.
So what kind of a contributor was I?
And one day -- I don't know what happened -- while coming back from the office towards home, maybe I saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee, life would be wonderful.
What the honey bee does: it pollinates, takes nectar from the flower, pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.
Look at this picture.
I'm so sorry to say that.
This is less than a dollar and this is non-stick; it is coated with one of these food-grade materials.
And the best part is that, while you use a costly non-stick pan, you eat the so-called Teflon or Teflon-like material because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?
It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that.  You know? But here in this clay hot plate, it will never go into your stomach.
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago and people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water -- that, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.
These are the people whose knowledge made this Herbavate cream for eczema possible.
And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it, it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.
There's a middle and an edge to this network, and the unhappy people seem to be located at the edges.
The two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun, you wouldn't have the time to do it.
So we made this thing.
The other idea is kind of interesting, which is, you can't reach inside anymore.
So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine.
They don't always get to everyone.
We could spend hours going over this.
It's got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle; they have sex, they burrow into your liver, they tunnel into your blood cells ...
So we hope this year to prototype each of these devices.
Because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels, and once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria.
We can see it because of this molecule called hemozoin.
We're going to the dry season now.
It nearly goes away in the dry season, because there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed.
The United States did.
What can we do to the mosquito?
Now, it actually gets better than this.
Audience: Yeah!
You can see where the limits of the reserve are because you see the boats lined up.
So, by way of introduction, that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years.  I teach high school math.
For example, factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one.
This is what we would love students to retain, even if they don't go into mathematical fields.
This is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.
I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.
I like this question. It's about a water tank.
So now we have a water tank.
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.
And then even better is we take a video, a video of someone filling it up.
This has been a lot of fun.
It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap, and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.
There's a medical revolution happening all around us, and it's one that's going to help us conquer some of society's most dreaded conditions, including cancer.
So the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time.
Dr. Judah Folkman, who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field, once called this "cancer without disease."
Cancer cells mutate, and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors, natural fertilizer, that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer.
So we created an antiangiogenic paste.
So I started asking myself, "Why haven't we been able to do better?"
So I went back to the biology of angiogenesis, and started thinking: Could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis, beating cancer at its own game, so the cancers could never become dangerous?
Let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes.
The top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse that eats nonstop until it turns fat, like this furry tennis ball.  And the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse.
The top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse that eats nonstop until it turns fat, like this furry tennis ball.  And the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse.
Stop the treatment, gains the weight back. Restart the treatment, loses the weight.
And if you look along the coast of Argentina, where I work now, at a place called Punta Tombo -- the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world down here about 44 degrees south latitude -- you see that there's great variation here.
Fortunately, nobody has harvested any penguins and we're getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them.
You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin that has a barcode, so it tells you who it is.
OK.
So, that's one of the stories of oil; there's just a lot of it.
But what about oil? Where is it in the energy system?
There was one kind of peak oil in 1985, when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply.
Now, it's about 35 percent.
Now, I'll tell you another little, very important story about this picture.
Now, I'll tell you another little, very important story about this picture.
Here's a piece of limestone.
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls, Texas.
It's about 400 million years old.
Now, here's a piece of chalk.
I picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger.

So this is the first self-replicating species that we've had on the planet whose parent is a computer.
So, substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially.
It's an amazing step forward, but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast.
And we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them.
It turns out, the DNA in the bacterial cell was actually methylated, and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme, from digesting the DNA.
But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end, and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence.
There's parts of the genome where it cannot tolerate even a single error, and then there's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of DNA, as we did with the watermarks, and it can tolerate all kinds of errors.
So early on, we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the DNA to absolutely make clear that the DNA was synthetic.
The second quotation is, "See things not as they are, but as they might be."
And I said, "Sure."
And four years later, it's been downloaded four million times.
We don't teach American history in Britain.
When I arrived in L.A. about nine years ago, I came across a policy statement -- very well-intentioned -- which said, "College begins in kindergarten."
The other is like Zagat and Michelin restaurants, where everything is not standardized, they're customized to local circumstances.
If you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit, five minutes feels like an hour.
We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture.
She goes to this vintage store in Paris with a friend of hers.
She's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga -- she loves it.
She's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction.
Her friend says, "Buy it already."
They didn't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing.
I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through.
And this is a good thing. We need lots of options.
But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world, it turns out that the protection that's offered is really ineffectual.
It turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low.
There's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection, including the food industry.
It's really hard to get copyright for databases.
It's really hard to get copyright for databases.
Nowadays, we don't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold.
It's a digital file.
And my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future.
But he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to 100 percent, and that is a severe flu pandemic.
In the developing world, the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher.
In 1918, a new virus appeared that killed some 50 to 100 million people.
We knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error.
These memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed.
So let's take a look at the flu virus.
This year's H1N1 threat was actually a human, avian, swine mixture that arose in Mexico.
The virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted.
The virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted.
If you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models, they provide full protection from infection.
In addition, these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab onto, and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates.
We really could think of flu, then, as just a bad cold.
If you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium, which creates a vigorous immune response, they've created a very powerful flu fighter.
JS: One remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience.
They don't understand real world space.
But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses, human things, like this picture that shows a leatherback caught at night in a gill net.
The story is, Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online.
So I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes that that's a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do.
But I think to set the scene, I want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED, but it is a bit of a mess.
And it's actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs.
So that's what we're arguing about.
And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus, which is about as big as the British Isles.
What's fascinating and beautiful ...
Our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful.
Because, for the first time, we saw our world, not as a solid, immovable, kind of indestructible place, but as a very small, fragile-looking world just hanging against the blackness of space.
What's also not often said about the space exploration, about the Apollo program, is the economic contribution it made.
What's also not often said about the space exploration, about the Apollo program, is the economic contribution it made.
And that's why helium's called helium.
That's a limit imposed on the mass of stars.
So that star is also 50 million light years away.
It sits there about, say, 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.
It sits there about, say, 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.
And it has a binary companion that goes around it, so a big star, a big ball of gas.
And what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star, until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit, and then it explodes.
Now, it doesn't look like our home planet.
The Voyager is a tiny machine.
And it took this picture of Earth.
You could have made it in the 1890s; you wouldn't have the transistor.
The machine itself would start the music.
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.
And speaking of synchronization, they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way.
The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions.
And we lost one high-heeled shoe when one of our engineers, Heather Knight, left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner, and returned back to the build -- and left it in a pile of stuff.
And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use" and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.
And yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.
It is about a country in the southwest of Africa called Namibia.
Boy, if you are looking after our livestock and you see a cheetah eating our goat -- cheetah is very nervous -- just walk up to it.
Don't move. Stand your ground.
This is our new economy -- an economy based on the respect of our natural resources.
And we are able to use this money for many things: Very importantly, we put it in education.
My guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift in the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm is probably 500 to 1,000 pounds max.
So what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very, very large budget.
So I did come up with five suggestions, which they are actually actioning.
But what is happening is that effectively -- and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn't helped this; lots of things haven't helped this -- business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy.
Every corporation should have one, and every government should have a Ministry of Detail.
But we move to cities, toward the bright lights, and one of the things that is there that we want, besides jobs, is electricity.
The nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don't have underground storage yet.
It's just as well, because it can stay where it is.
It's just as well, because it can stay where it is.
That's cellulosic, second generation biofuels from prairie grass.
There's plenty of solar and wind.
And our "against" proponent up here made it very clear that we actually do.
It doesn't change key, the notes are long, there's almost no rhythm whatsoever, and the room flatters the music.
They used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage, just like they do at CBGB's and places like that.
And the size of the room is not that big.
The Romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion, and then somehow it gets shaped into something.
this device, the ADE 651, was sold to the Iraqi government for 40,000 dollars apiece.
this device, the ADE 651, was sold to the Iraqi government for 40,000 dollars apiece.
And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward, they repeat that particular pattern.
When we do this process, we make two types of errors.
Our second type of error is a false negative.
Your next decision could be the most important one of your life.
You're more cautious. You're more vigilant.
Some people see a Dalmatian dog.
That is, how accurate we are in finding patterns.
I'm going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on.
Whether you're an artist, a technologist, a lawyer or a fan, the handling of copyright directly impacts your life.
The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations to end domestic violence.
So why has no one ever solved this problem before?
This is a plot of frequency against time -- sort of like musical notation, where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower, and time goes this way.
But there are some exceptions.
This is a plot from Christopher Clark who tracked one individual blue whale as it passed by Bermuda, went down to the latitude of Miami and came back again.
But in '96 they heard a few weird songs, and it turned out that these strange songs were typical of west coast whales.
Every problem that's out there, somebody has the idea for.
Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease?
Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.
Why don't you teach them not to waste money?
Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease.
I want to close with a quick little video.
These guys, Grasshopper.
So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.
As I spent my week up in the Himalayas, I started to imagine what I call an emotional equation.
GDP counts everything from air pollution to the destruction of our redwoods.
The ego is not supposed to be involved in graphic design.
And here it is with the abstract surrounding.
And then I used it again to create six pieces for Stefan's book, "Things in My Life I've Learned So Far."
I reduced my mailing list to 150 people.
But I really believe that a fully operating, rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing.
But I really believe that a fully operating, rich society needs these seeds coming from all directions and all disciplines in order to keep the gears of inspiration and imagination flowing and cycling and growing.
Well, so, for this last year, with the help of Cisco who sponsored me, for some balmy reason, to do this, I've been looking somewhere else.
The one technology that spans rich and poor in places like this is not anything to do with industrial technology.
Here, there isn't really an option.
Learning has to be productive in order for it to make sense.
And finally, they have a different model of scale, and it's a Chinese restaurant model of how to scale.
McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said, "You know what you should do with this, Madhav?
Yet, everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant.
They know what to expect, even though it'll be subtly different and the colors will be different and the name will be different.
But it is, unlike cars, which have developed so rapidly and orderly, actually the school system is recognizably an inheritance from the 19th century, from a Bismarkian model of German schooling that got taken up by English reformers, and often by religious missionaries, taken up in the United States as a force of social cohesion, and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed.
And of course it's a huge achievement.
And of course it will bring great things.
It will bring skills and learning and reading.
But it will also lay waste to imagination.
It will lay waste to appetite. It will lay waste to social confidence.
When I was 10 years old, a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.
Bought him this.
Ushahidi -- the name means "witness" or "testimony" in Swahili -- is a very simple way of taking reports from the field, whether it's from the web or, critically, via mobile phones and SMS, aggregating it and putting it on a map.
I call it cognitive surplus.
When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site, the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new Main Street, several apartments and condo buildings, while keeping the existing office buildings.
Here is the site in 1940: It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville.
This project, I think, has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods.
No, it's pockets of walkability on the sites of under-performing properties.
Now, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.
We don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.
They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.
Well, the topic I'm going to discuss is one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar because it's very old.
Roughness is part of human life forever and forever, and ancient authors have written about it.
Now why do I show a cauliflower, a very ordinary and ancient vegetable?
Because old and ancient as it may be, it's very complicated and it's very simple, both at the same time.
I said, "Well, just short of 1.5."
The bronchi branch, branch, branch and they stop branching, not because of any matter of principle, but because of physical considerations: the mucus, which is in the lung.
Mathematicians got into self-praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing, that man can invent things that nature did not know.
To the right, on top, you see a theory which is very, very fashionable.
So that was kind of my first dream, was to start this company called FEED, and here's a screenshot of our website.
Well, agriculture in America's very interesting.
And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world, which we still use linguistically when we talk about "the West" and "the Developing World."
But it's a very important role.
It's like you dipped a marble in water.
Beyond warming, we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified -- and already measurably so, and already affecting animals.
Now in the laboratory, if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is -- not 8.1, which is the normal pH of seawater -- but 7.5, it dissolves in about three days.
Now in the laboratory, if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is -- not 8.1, which is the normal pH of seawater -- but 7.5, it dissolves in about three days.
But you can see it.
I don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills.
The booms are absolutely not made for open water.
But I think we have to understand where this leak really started from.
And people say we can't have clean energy because it's too expensive.
Energy is always a moral issue.
How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?
If you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside.
You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.
What happens when you cut people off from exchange, from the ability to exchange and specialize?
The Tasmanians were isolated.
The Tasmanians were isolated.
Go back to this image again and ask yourself, not only who made it and for who, but who knew how to make it.
We all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole.
Ethan Zuckerman: Obviously, this is a tragic situation, and it actually gets worse.
You start looking at how the global plane flights move, and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat.
The world is, in fact, getting more global.
Dhani has a television show.
Many people visited my grandmother, people with severe acne on their faces or warts on their hands.
When my first novel written in English came out in America, I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.
We often talk about how stories change the world, but we should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being circulated, read and reviewed.
And when I say, "just a story," I'm not trying to belittle my work.
Literature has to take us beyond.
And when Kibaki got into power -- through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya -- they commissioned this report, spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report.
When we released that report, we did so three days after the new president, Kibaki, had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out, Daniel arap Moi, so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki's neck.
But remember, the people in Baghdad, the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan -- they don't need to see the video; they see it every day.
That's what they see every day.
We don't know, but what can we do?
We don't know, but what can we do?
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document?
Unfortunately, at the moment, it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts.
As an undergrad at Tufts University, we were giving away free falafel one day and, you know, it was Middle East Day or something.
On April 26, 2010, President Barack Obama said that of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech -- in which he reached out to the Muslim world -- the most innovative was that The 99 reach back out to the Justice League of America.
Our team, befittingly I think, named it after one of those dreamers of the Copernican time, Johannes Kepler, and that telescope's sole purpose is to go out, find the planets that orbit other stars in our galaxy, and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth happen to be out there.
The one that this step is enabling us to do is coming next.
I really mean life on Earth, past and present, from microbes to us humans, in its rich molecular diversity, the way we now understand life on Earth as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions -- and we call that, collectively, biochemistry, life as a chemical process, as a chemical phenomenon.
So the question is: is that chemical phenomenon universal, or is it something which depends on the planet?
Life on Earth is the size of the Earth.
This is very significant.
Up until now, our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms.
So the device that you see is a 14-channel, high-fidelity EEG acquisition system.
It only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle.
And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue.
And so that's not going to be a solution that's going to get us global with biologic tissue.
And I started first with cow Achilles tendon, where we would take the cow Achilles tendon, which is type-I collagen, strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template.
We would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient's knee.
What we do is humanize the tissue.
We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts.
Pretty soon, a lengthy discussion ensued, and finally the manager came over to me and said, "I am very sorry. We do not have sugar."
As I do so, I hope you'll start thinking about some of your own assumptions and how they were shaped by your backgrounds.
Yet that is exactly what the American paradigm demands.
It leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.
When someone can't see how one choice is unlike another, or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast, the process of choosing can be confusing and frustrating.
Choice no longer offers opportunities, but imposes constraints.
This narrative promises so much: freedom, happiness, success.
It lays the world at your feet and says, "You can have anything, everything."
So my project is along the Northwest Atlantic.
The decision was to protect the marshes.
So this shows oil on the surface.
They're like the FedEx guys.
Corexit also contains petroleum solvents and many other toxic compounds.
The system isn't Chesapeake Bay.
It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific.
That's the planet that we live on.
So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.
Last year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole.
And that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds, and it felt like 18 days.
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.
It's always population growth.
All the palm oil going there is good.

Female Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important, but remember, even this choice will affect how Milo develops.
When you see the microphone, say ...  ... yes to decide.
Now look at his response.
His mind is based in a cloud.
In Jordan, we had His Majesty the King come and see them.
Thought the guy was going to come back and be like, "We've been looking for you for 200 years."
"You take a taxi. You go to Zara. Make a left."
I'm sort of making this claim that there is a game layer on top of the world, and that it's very important that we build it properly.
There's still a lot to explore.
They own half a billion people.
To win, all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time.
That's a really scary thought, that one game dynamic can change things so powerfully.
You have retrospectives, anniversaries, court cases, even copy-cat shootings, all pushing that fear into the agenda.
And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it?
Why is there a gap there?
Because for me, it feels like a fertile, creative medium.
But it's a really fertile medium, and it feels like visualizations, infographics, data visualizations, they feel like flowers blooming from this medium.
But it's a really fertile medium, and it feels like visualizations, infographics, data visualizations, they feel like flowers blooming from this medium.
I feel that everyday, all of us now are being blasted by information design.
Your sense of sight is the fastest.
The eye is exquisitely sensitive to patterns in variations in color, shape and pattern.
Now this app is spawning itself from the data.
It's kind of living.
I like to apply information visualization to ideas and concepts.
This is a visualization of the political spectrum, an attempt for me to try and understand how it works and how the ideas percolate down from government into society and culture, into families, into individuals, into their beliefs and back around again in a cycle.
Yet, the ice of Antarctica is a calendar of climate change.
Here, the ice seems a living presence.
Before that day, this is how I saw the ocean.
It's just incredible; no Hollywood designer could come up with something more interesting than that.
The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk.
Basically, this bottle travels a long way.
So, I sent them to Boise, Idaho, where they dropped a plastic bottle into the Boise sewer system.
So you say to yourself, "Well, that's worth something."
So this is what happens as that burn gets going.
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules.
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous.
Oil doesn't sink, it floats.
If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water.
It's incredibly hard to clean up.
They really influence people.
When the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969, it formed the environmental movement in its modern form.
It started Earth Day.
We stopped drilling in ANWR, but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed.
But if we rearrange this formula quickly, we can get to acceleration equals force over mass, which means that for a larger particle -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction.
Getting a little more technical now.
So this says that it's impossible, by definition, to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position -- and the momentum of a particle, because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.
So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it, then the photon of light has momentum, which knocks the particle, so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.
So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it, then the photon of light has momentum, which knocks the particle, so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.
By measuring it, the act of measurement changes it.
Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking, more digital media consumption, you can measure more what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they do.
The marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do, rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do.
So next, the scientific method -- an axiom of physics, of all science -- says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation, you can only disprove it.
Well, you know the story.
And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism.
Okay, they think money is slightly important.
But we have to remember that there's a fundamental input to that, and that is how many of the planet's resources we use.
We all have one planet. We all have to share it.
The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about -- is that the future might not be North American, might not be Western European.
That's how you create a collective goal.
This is bad news, but perhaps surprising to you, it's also part of the good news.
The Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture, we domesticate animals and plants.
You have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it.
And the drama is, of course, that when the system does this, the logic may change.
We need nothing less than a new green revolution, and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink.
Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal.
So that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood is the mycelial felt of the fungus, and what it's doing -- it's actually slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients.
And then, you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached 405 years old.
And this brings me to another favorite of mine -- I think, because it is just so unusual.
This plant is called the Welwitschia, and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola, where it's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea.
The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English -- they'd never seen a computer before, and they didn't know what the internet was.
The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English -- they'd never seen a computer before, and they didn't know what the internet was.
I gave them a computer with a speech-to-text interface, which you now get free with Windows, and asked them to speak into it.
This is in Cambodia, rural Cambodia -- a fairly silly arithmetic game, which no child would play inside the classroom or at home.
They'd say, "This is very boring."
A self-organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside.
You know, like just adjacent to me.
He just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?"
This is called "Dawn to Dawn."
This is how we've been taught in school.
So if someone says, "Oh, I see the portrait," it may not be the portrait after a few months.
So, I did this work for her.
And what I'd like to tell you is we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too; we see the source of the light.
We see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark, but it's filled with light all the time.
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark, but it's filled with light all the time.
Because when we see someone walks, we see the footprint.
It wasn't the only reason, and life is not simple, one reason narratives.
This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about.
In fact, the lore for many years has been, "The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago, and it's been there ever since."
When these things die, immediately, organisms come in and encrust and live on that dead surface.
And that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters, until 1954, when the earthquake happened.
But here's what we can say: what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down.
You know, innovation's hard work.
And the hardest part about that is probably the light, because it means you have to open up, you have to show your stuff to the world.
These are chemical clocks, and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell.
These are chemical clocks, and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell.
I'll give you an example -- if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach, and you fly it all the way across the continent, and you drop it into a sloped cage, it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores, and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away.
So, we have this ability as well.
So fine, we have a body clock, and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives.
It's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique.
In interior decorating, the pig's actually quite there.
And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery.
It was a space where people would get together from different backgrounds, different fields of expertise, and share.
These are standard in all the industrialized worlds.
There are passages where you can read it, and you think you're reading from a Darwin textbook, from the period before he has this epiphany.
It's hard to go to your boss and say, "I have an excellent idea for our organization.
But I think there's a case to be made that we should spend at least as much time, if not more, valuing the premise of connecting ideas and not just protecting them.
And after a couple of hours, they actually start picking up the signal, because the Soviets made Sputnik very easy to track.
It was right at 20 MHz, so you could pick it up really easily, because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax, basically.
We may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this.
And that's how GPS was born.
They're hired -- they're paid as professional members of the health care teams, just like doctors and nurses.
I started the program in Capetown, South Africa back in 2001.
On the other hand, we humans, we live in a physical world.
So you move around the content on a display, but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device.
Another thing it's good for is navigation -- it can guide you around in a city.
Think of a hamster in the pocket.
Think of a hamster in the pocket.
So, once again, mobile phone-shaped box, but this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat, and it feels very organic.
And you can tell, it's relaxed right now.
Oh now, missed call, a new call, new girlfriend maybe -- very exciting.  How do we calm it down?
Listening is an active skill, whereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at -- it's a relationship with sound.
Reductive listening is listening "for."
Expansive listening, on the other hand, is listening "with," not listening "for."
The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression.
I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities, eight ways sound can improve health.
I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities, eight ways sound can improve health.
Sound healing is a wonderful modality.
This little black dot there is a 3D accelerometer.
It tracks your movement through space.
What is this for?
What should it be for?
Some people will say it's for biometric security.
Some people will say it's for public health research.
Some people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research.
I'd like to tell you that it's also for self-knowledge.
They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter.
Neuroscience is hopeless."
But even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that I am my connectome.
Neural activity is constantly changing.
Why?
They did not want to do this, it just happened -- they lost control.
And also -- I think -- without psycho-social therapy, and without considering this in all humanitarian projects, we cannot build-up civil societies.
In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it -- so the condom is the girl's best friend.
And that was run by them.
And after 35/36 years, it's still going on.
It's a part of the Village Development Bank; it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit.
It's a part of the Village Development Bank; it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit.
The money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting.
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year, in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops.
The EPA estimates, in the United States, by volume, this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills.
Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment -- on the side of the road or next to a river.
If it's not picked up by a human, like me and you, it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years.
But nature provides us with a really good model here.
When a tree's done using its leaves -- its solar collectors, these amazing molecular photon capturing devices -- at the end of a season, it doesn't pack them up, take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves.
This is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment.
And here, all of a sudden, we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic -- the economic institutions, and who we are as people, locked together to drive an engine of growth.
And even if we don't want them, we need to buy them, because, if we don't buy them, the system crashes.
This fish was revered by humankind.
It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf, the entire Pacific realm.
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin -- it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.
And then, better yet, we've got our own version of tuna whisperers, our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton, who can take a big tuna and in one motion, put it into an envelope of water, so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea.
Jeff and Jason there, are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.
A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes.
And then with a lot of effort, after tagging, putting in the computer, making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment, we send this fish back into the sea.
The warm is the Gulf Stream, the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.
So what we've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska, met salmon shark on their home territory, followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line, we can actually take up a salmon shark -- This is the cousin of the white shark -- and very carefully -- note, I say "very carefully," --
And now with Google's Oceans, we can actually put a white shark in that ocean.
This was the estimate of the new survey.
It's very good -- "Levels and Trends in Child Mortality" -- except this page.
This page is very bad; it's a categorization of countries.
Imagine, if you will -- a gift.
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.
It's not too big -- about the size of a golf ball.
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.
But before I show you what's inside, I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.
This gift came to me about five months ago.
And this, and then this.
And while I'm okay now, I wouldn't wish this gift for you.
But I wouldn't change my experience.
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you.
Here we have the description of the order of nature.
It's the same in plants, in insects and in animals.
So we studied the root apex and we found that there is a specific region that is here, depicted in blue -- that is called the "transition zone."
So you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus and the plants [continue] to work.
I feel that, if we can understand what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous, we can apply those lessons then for the public good.
I feel that, if we can understand what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous, we can apply those lessons then for the public good.
They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."
So, they rely on Coca-Cola in terms of its marketing, and what's the secret to their marketing?
Well, it's aspirational.
So how does health and development market?
But there's a solution: you build a toilet.
But there's a solution: you build a toilet.
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border, or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.
After all, it was the buildings, not the earthquake, that killed 220,000 people, that injured 330,000, that displaced 1.3 million people, that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation.
Seismic standards and confined masonry, where the building acts as a whole -- walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other -- instead of breaking off into separate members and failing.
He showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong.
The way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail.
But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening -- there's a few action shots -- your neighbors are likely to say, "What are you doing?"
It's very different from the medical model.
It's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion, not from combustion itself.
That's the sound of genetic mutations of the avian flu becoming a deadly human flu.
You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him.
And what I like to think of is this is an interface that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems, specifically by changing who has information, where they have it, who can make sense of that information, and what you can do about it.
And Yellowstone National Park, there's more "do not feed the animals" signs than there are animals you might wish to feed.
Every presentation needs this slide in it.
It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it.
So what I did -- unfortunately, I was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of me, and it started to eat away at my psyche.
The money came in basically overnight.
This technology made a very important impact on us.
It changed the way our history developed.
So cooking is a very important technology.
Okay, it's not obvious to be honest.
But how did it actually run this show?
The gut is actually the largest immune system, defending your body.
This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest, which is actually the lumen.
Now if you think about the gut, the gut is -- if you could stretch it -- 40 meters long, the length of a tennis court.
Now if you think about the gut, the gut is -- if you could stretch it -- 40 meters long, the length of a tennis court.
And now this brain takes care over this, to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and, of course, digest our food we cook.
So if we give you a specification, this brain, which is autonomous, have 500 million nerve cells, 100 million neurons -- so around the size of a cat brain, so there sleeps a little cat -- thinks for itself, optimizes whatever it digests.
It has 20 different neuron types.
It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain, where you have 100 billion neurons.
It has autonomous organized microcircuits, has these programs which run.
It senses the food; it knows exactly what to do.
It's this brain which makes this reflex.
Now how do the two brains work with each other?
The big brain integrates signals, which come from the running programs of the lower brain, But subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower.
If you have an empty stomach, your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin.
So if you override the hunger signal, you can have a disorder, which is called anorexia.
The more usual case is overeating.
The more usual case is overeating.
And finally, on your right side, you see a bubbly, cell-like structure appearing, from which the body will absorb the fat.
And finally, on your right side, you see a bubbly, cell-like structure appearing, from which the body will absorb the fat.
And I thought, "Great.
Upon educating myself a little further about plastics, I actually realized this was a bad thing.
So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers, a crane, a chipping machine and a cold-molding machine.
Ladies and gentlemen, the world has gotten smaller.
Well, the Internet has empowered us.
No, but it's true: the Internet has changed the world.
For those of you old enough to remember, we used to have to go to the store to steal it.
But yeah, it has liberated us from the office desk.
And he said, "Well, I won't define the vehicle for you, but I will define the cost for you.
Sir Francis Bacon once said, "When you wish to achieve results that have not been achieved before, it is an unwise fancy to think that they can be achieved by using methods that have been used before."
One day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of a convex lens.
And then he said, "This is the focal length."
What does that focal length do?
What does that convex lens do?
Now that's a big abstract number.
And that ability to get others to want what you want, to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment, is what I call soft power.
Let me say a word now about the distribution of power and how it relates to power diffusion and then pull these two types together.
We've seen an image of our blue planet, our world bank.
What is a pest?
And again, in action.
But this isn't the really interesting stuff.
They think this game is unfair.
Ten years ago was a seminal trip, where we explored that big iceberg, B-15, the largest iceberg in history, that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.
And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts.
The peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts.
Here's this resource that we're looking to save, and it turns out it's the hottest heating event that we can find on record.
But in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination, my motives are not sinister.
I control the brain in order to understand how it works.
We need to rearrange the pattern.
You can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light-activated pore and others don't.
And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.
The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them, but it can't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates.
Here's some such CCTV footage.
Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet, it has to make a decision.
We thought if we could use our optical remote control to activate the cells of the Critic, we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor into changing its policy.
So the next time the fly finds itself facing the same odor again, the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors and to trigger an evasive maneuver.
I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months.
They're feedback loops.
All right.
It doesn't have a name yet.
♫ Go ahead and congratulate yourself ♫ ♫ Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand ♫ ♫ And the eye that eyes itself is your eye ♫ ♫ And the ear that hears itself is near ♫ ♫ 'Cause it's your ear, oh oh ♫ ♫ You've done the impossible now ♫ ♫ Took yourself apart ♫ ♫ You made yourself invulnerable ♫
This is the most kind of direct, obvious intersection of the two things.
So this game that the kids are playing here -- in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called Match Me.
And what design offers as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by.
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that's a homework assignment.
And for the community, what design and building offers is real, visible, built progress.
Three things stand out: leadership, diplomacy and institutional design.
Since the high in the early 1990s, with about 50 such civil wars ongoing, we now have 30 percent fewer such conflicts today.
Diplomacy needs to be well resourced, sustained, and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures on leaders and followers.
So let's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain, and know that when you see these people's faces that these are not just images of the Lakota; they stand for all indigenous people.
1869: The transcontinental railroad was completed.
The Wounded Knee massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars.
We all love chocolate.
So at a national level -- and we work in about 60 different countries -- at a national level we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments to regulate production on their own soil.
Everybody else at the table said, "Folks, that doesn't cut it.
So here's a food web, or a map of feeding links between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California.
I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work.
See, in the real world math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.
It's done by geologists, engineers, biologists, all sorts of different people -- modeling and simulation.
Lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world, except if you're learning it.
And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?
And of course, math is very powerful at doing that.
See, I think of calculating, in a sense, as the machinery of math.
It's the chore.
It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.
Basics of what?
When they're out of education, they do it on a computer.
Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem, actually make it more conceptual.
It's called programming.
What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they've ever got before.
What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they've ever got before.
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum.
Calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years.
I can, however, give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have.
Of course, a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question, "What is beauty?"
It's in the eye of the beholder.
The peacock's magnificent tail is the most famous example of this.
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?
No, it's deep in our minds.
And before I worked with the kids, anything that I did with them, or anything that I did with myself, was supposed to be perfect, ideal, optimal, but after working with them for some time, I discovered the great virtues of empathy and flexibility and being able to start with some vision, and if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened.
I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali, and there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia, and together, over 20 years, we built an amazing jewelry business.
And this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world, in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river.
There's nowhere to flush.
These young ladies are living in a rice culture, but they know something that few people know in a rice culture.
And together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global, green leaders.
From the time the foundations were finished, in three months it had roofs and floors.
Green School is a model we built for the world.
With an average depth of the oceans of 4,000 meters, in fact, the high seas covers and provides nearly 90 percent of the habitat for life on this Earth.
It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all.
It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all.
As such, it does create a challenge to protect, but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.
So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor Sylvia Earle for her wish, for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.
It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote.
The definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of consciousness.
The CDC has a program, Heads Up.
This is a great resource for student athletes, teachers, parents, professionals, athletic and coaching staff.
I thought it was just like the movies, but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray, and a full circle of explosion.
I thought it was just like the movies, but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing full of bright red and orange and gray, and a full circle of explosion.
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared.
But there's another side that I have witnessed as someone who lived in it and someone who ended up working in it.
And then if you're smart enough, it goes on a basket on top of the washer.
Then, these corbeles going down underneath the eaves are that little design that comes off the can.
Then, this panel of glass is the same panel of glass that occurs in every middle-class front door in America.
We're getting tired of it. It's kind of cliched now.
So if you put it in the front door, your design fails.
So if you put it in the front door, your design fails.
So don't put it in the front door; put it somewhere else.
It's a pretty panel of glass.
But then if you put it in the front door, people say, "Oh, you're trying to be like those guys, and you didn't make it."
So you translate that to the building industry, if we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked, we go, "Oh, dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it.
Never mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all.
And pretty soon, we're swilling that stuff by the lake-ful, by the billions of gallons.
Then a man named Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book titled "Being and Nothingness."
It's a pretty quick read.
They had one camel left over.
They gave it back to the wise old woman.
And I think I've found, in some ways, what is the secret to peace.
It's actually surprisingly simple.
It's not easy, but it's simple.
It's not even new.
That system, I call "the third side."
Now, the acorn is associated with the oak tree, of course -- grows into an oak tree, which is associated with Abraham.
And if you look at the figures up there, it says that we have a third more mouths to feed, but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent.
And meat, in fact, is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production.
And we eat quite a lot of it.
In the developed world it's on average 80 kilograms per person per year, which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries, but on average 80 kilograms per person per year.
It's 25 kilograms per person per year.
But it's increasing enormously.
So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average, and a third of the world population is living in China and in India, we're having an enormous demand on meat.
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.
They are delicacies.
There, the animal finds a mine.
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward, which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.
Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.
There's a number of mines placed blindly, and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets.
Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world.
The humble potato -- and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these.
And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime.
First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy.
It's then distributed, and distribution is a massive issue.
It's then sold and bought, and it's then delivered to me.
This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood.
Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.
Rather than me putting a dish down, they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.
Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.
You can't get rid of waste.
I compost it in this garden.
And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.
This takes the water out of the restaurant, runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there -- and I sort of water the garden with it.
The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.
And it's run on hydroelectricity, so I've gone from air to water.
Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water, heated by water, filters its own water, and it's powered by water.
This is basically air-handling.
In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant, there is hundreds of meters of coil piping.
So now there's a living room full of guys.
It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.
I myself have a husband and a father and two sons whom I dearly love.
This has been going on for 40 years now.
Now you laugh, but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?
Now I've never really liked this term.
Didn't read anything. "There it is."
RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website.
I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested, and in fact, it was not like that at all.
I felt incredibly connected to the community around me.
So this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life.
Now my husband, Chris, and I love this show.
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists, that 2008 is when we hit a wall, when Mother Nature and the market both said, "No more."
The first is redistribution markets.
The first is redistribution markets.
Now, the third system is product-service systems.
I don't want a clunky answering machine; I want the message it saves.
And this reputation capital will determine our access to collaborative consumption.
DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion is doing exactly what his name, Eetwidomayloh, represents.
We admire them, and we fear them, and yet, as man, we want to steal their power.
It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin, but now throughout rituals and ceremonies, traditional healers and ministers.
DJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about and designed our lives by -- that conservation was all about respect and celebration -- is probably true. That's really what it needs.
I don't have the right answer.
Your job needs to be challenging.
Working-class and poor urban Americans are not benefiting economically from our current food system.
These examples indicate a trend.
And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work, and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the "life's messy, love it."
And so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me -- really, one of the big sayings in social work is, "Lean into the discomfort of the work."
The only people who don't experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection.
And so I thought, this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick.
And I kind of got a handle on it.
And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute.
If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me, but it doesn't work.
Even Goldman Sachs once used to serve clients, before it turned into an institution that serves only itself.
I did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are.
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran.
There's not too many brain-dead people creating art.
So in the end, it's not the most natural environment, but they're able to play real music.
In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars, digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography, and in fact, it was worse in older women.
Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies, so it's not widely used.
But this technology could not find tumors when they're small, and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.
This is our current detector.
After achieving what we felt were remarkable results, our manuscript was rejected by four journals.
And fourth and most important, the mammography debate will rage on, but I do believe that all women 40 and older should have an annual mammogram.
I mean, 50,000 blogs are started a day, and so my blog was just one of those 50,000.
And nobody read it except for my mom.
Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by 100 percent when she forwarded it to my dad.
And then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits, and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions.
And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf, and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.
And when we did, my dad would say, "Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there, picked this thing off it, put it in a truck, drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,
The cashiers at your grocery store, the foreman at your plant, the guy tailgating you home on the highway, the telemarketer calling you during dinner, every teacher you've ever had, everyone that's ever woken up beside you, every politician in every country, every actor in every movie, every single person in your family, everyone you love, everyone in this room and you will be dead in a hundred years.
What does the inside of your computer actually look like?
I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders.
But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works.
But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works.
So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.
Thomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up.
And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore, because, though Ray was a miner there, the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction, because, of course, it can't compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America, Australia, wherever.
And so this is after a day and about half a night smelting this iron.
Again, this mine was once the largest copper mine in the world.
So kind of out of desperation, I decided that I could think laterally.
That's it without the case on.
Thanks.
We want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average, but what this does to our children is really not healthy.
So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we didn't have to worry about it, this disaster is still unfolding.
Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or -- where we're currently going -- four degrees Celsius?"
I'm always surprised by how little people outside of Canada know about the Alberta Tar Sands, which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the United States.
The oil is not liquid.
If you go through a metal detector, you'll probably die.
Within a few weeks, I was performing, and in a few months, I debuted at the Kennedy Center.
An infection ravaged my skin.
But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it?
This is terrible, this oil -- it's in the water.
Well that insight of biomimicry, of our scientists finally realizing that we have as much to learn from other species.
So this is really what we're doing.
Here's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person.
And he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device, the force feedback system, and he's moving his pen towards the heart, and the heart is now beating in front of him, so he can see how the heart is beating.
And he's also hearing our instructions when we tell him to do things.
So here's a bear.
Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.
So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length.
It knows how much it's moving.
I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today.
Now don't be shy.
It's just a robot.
Anyone?
Any of you like television? Audience: Yes.
Data: I find it incredibly educational.
It's an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition, markets and technology.
When China gets its hands on Hong Kong, that won't be the case."
It doesn't work.
And the second reason is because, whereas in Europe and North America, the state's power is continuously challenged -- I mean in the European tradition, historically against the church, against other sectors of the aristocracy, against merchants and so on -- for 1,000 years, the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged.
The result, by the way, is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state.
The state is everywhere in China.
Unfortunately, I think, I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.
It's kind of arrogant.
It's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best, and therefore we have the universal measure.
And that is what is going to happen in the future.
Here you have a megabus, on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people.
It travels on rails down a suburban road, and the cars travel underneath it.
But it looks completely right.
So let me just walk through this quickly.
You can understand exactly what the benefits are.
Now a lot of our effort on this one -- as many of you probably know, a PSA test is a very controversial test.
So this patient is in their 50s, so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is.
We're being corrected, and the primary policemen are women, because we are the carriers of the tradition.
Humor relies on the traditions of a society.
It takes what we know, and it twists it.
Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists, which I so enjoy, and it's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth, to get at the issues quickly and succinctly.
So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men.
And if you did see the Sanjay special, you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis.
Then he took my fibula from my calf, cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh, where it now lives.
Don't give in to the wall.
And I just love this ode to slow moving.
I get asked two questions about this project.
Makers and shapers and put-it-togetherers.
This is probably the best time in the history of mankind to love space.
Suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn't been before.
You take a horse on a hot day, and after about five or six miles, that horse has a choice.
I know that beat.
I know intimately that skin you are hitting.
Poetry does that.
All colors run, none of us solid.
It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead.
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance.
This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo, introducing Leo to a new object.
Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work.
And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach.
It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do.
It could make eye contact with you.
You'd use a screen interface to enter information, like how many calories you ate that day, how much exercise you got.
And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and patients and so forth.
And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue.
It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world.
It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world.
So they are now sending the character back into that world.
You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products, and all of those have benefited from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period.
And let's start with radical increases in resource efficiency.
So we started exploring this material called ETFE.
And what you do is you put it together in three layers, you weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it.
So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.
They then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding.
When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it.
And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time, there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing.
And if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts, there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity.
This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle, and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert.
This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle, and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert.
And the effect of this is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps, they stay in tight, spherical beads, which means they're much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell.
And the effect of this is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps, they stay in tight, spherical beads, which means they're much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell.
And then at the back of the greenhouse, it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle.
And that builds up on the evaporators -- and that's what that image on the left is -- gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate.
Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine.
The track that I will whistle is called "Fête de la Belle."
It's about 80 minutes long.
I'll ask the technicians to start the music.
But compassion, from my vantage point, has a problem.
As essential as it is across our traditions, as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives, the word "compassion" is hollowed out in our culture, and it is suspect in my field of journalism.
Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story of giving a speech in Holland and, after the fact, the word "compassion" was translated as "pity."
Now the word "tolerance," if you look at it in the dictionary, connotes "allowing," "indulging" and "enduring."
Compassion is a worthy successor.
It is organic, across our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions, and yet it transcends them.
Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others, both in our private and in our civic spaces.
Compassion can be synonymous with empathy.
It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation, but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence.
And in that light, for the religious, compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty, but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering, in the face of a stranger, in the face of the vibrant religious other.
I'm not sure if I can show you what tolerance looks like, but I can show you what compassion looks like -- because it is visible.
I'm not sure if I can show you what tolerance looks like, but I can show you what compassion looks like -- because it is visible.
And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit.
He's says that what they do with L'Arche is not a solution, but a sign.
There is, of course, a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of Judaism to repair the world -- tikkun olam.
There is, of course, a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of Judaism to repair the world -- tikkun olam.
It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation.
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale.
And Einstein said -- and I think this is a quote, again, that has not been passed down in his legacy -- that "these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living, more necessary to the dignity, security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge."
And Karen Armstrong, I think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that, with a zigzag, have led to the Charter for Compassion.
But compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious.
After puberty, we fall off the map.
At Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital -- money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity, but as full-bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions.
And he said, "So I conclude that, in many ways, leadership is like a panicle of rice.
Because at the height of the season, at the height of its powers, it's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world, it reaches to the heavens."
All these things are share-platforms, but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what I refer to as the "mother of all share-platforms."
It's also -- Web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems, and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance.
Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe.
And so they were very clever about the way that they packaged car-sharing.
In the last year, 2010, two car companies started, one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar, and the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.
So, really interesting.
MA: Pretty big.
It's now traveling.
So being an American, I decided to set up a caucus.
At Number 10 Downing Street, David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double-dip recession.

Our face is hugely important because it's the external, visual part that everybody else sees.
And this bone is peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull with cavities, the sinuses, which warm and moisten the air we breathe.
It's skin from his back.
They have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy.
It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old.
It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old.
This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable.
True navigation begins in the human heart.
And in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body, and if that were only true, it would be great, but it's not.
It's like the parts list of your body.
You could certainly tell the difference between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant by what they had in a larder.
So why all the big deal about genetics?
It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right.
So this happens in physics all the time.
But it rarely happens in biology.
And if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug, we see that in the blood, they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug.
And so to give you an idea of an analogy of what I mean by thinking of cancering as a verb, imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing, and the way that we talked about it, we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen and we'd say, "Oh, my house has water."
We might divide it -- the plumber would say, "Well, where's the water?"
"Well, it's in the kitchen." "Oh, you must have kitchen water."
We want to play you one more selection.
I want to tell you something, that the Internet and connectivity has created [a] new mindset.
You really believe that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now, that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly?
I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine.
I love the way that people will ask me, "How big will my photo be?"
When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.
All Brazil was shocked.
Art. Just doing art.
Or they tell you, "Are these people all dead?"
Then art becomes useful.
So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.
Art can create an analogy.
There are various things in here: I could say we might raise more revenue, or medical innovation will make the spending even higher.
We then take a scaffold, a biomaterial -- again, looks very much like a piece of your blouse or your shirt -- we then shape that material, and we then use those cells to coat that material one layer at a time -- very much like baking a layer cake, if you will.
Here's the scanner going through, scanning the wound.
I was able to be a normal kid with my friends.
At this ripe old age of 30, I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up in this horrible, beautiful time, and I've decided, for me, it's been a real journey and paradox.
Anyone heard of these two guys as an example?
My mom and so many women like her have taught me that life is not about glory, or certainty, or security even.
It's about embracing the paradox.
It's about acting in the face of overwhelm.
Do it as long as necessary, until you have mastery.
Do it as long as necessary, until you have mastery.
Now that can work well for an individual learner, and I encourage you to do it with your kids, but I also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself.
They also got faster -- the height is how long it took them.
Do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out?
We've got a million people on the site already, so we can handle a few more.
So when I was growing up in a really rural area in Maine, the Internet meant something very different to me.
It meant something that would connect us all together.
Huffington Post, the Washington Post, the New York Times -- all flirting with personalization in various ways.
In a broadcast society -- this is how the founding mythology goes -- in a broadcast society, there were these gatekeepers, the editors, and they controlled the flows of information.
a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information, that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter, and then journalistic ethics developed.
And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't.
We need it to connect us all together.
And what we've done is use the word "water" to tag that moment, that bit of activity.
But as more people showed up wanting water, the folks who were there first got a little concerned, and in 1865, Montana passed its first water law.
Well, we decided to connect these two worlds -- the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks.
In some states, senior water rights holders can leave their water in-stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right.
After 140 years of conflict and 100 years of dry streams, a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved, we put together a market-based, willing buyer, willing seller solution -- a solution that does not require litigation.
If the wind blows them over, they're like beetles stuck there on the ground.
So one of the most cognitively demanding things we do is buy furniture.
It's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house.
And this work corrects that bias in our culture, that dehumanizing bias.
And face-to-face groups are much smarter than groups that communicate electronically, because 90 percent of our communication is non-verbal.
Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.
But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe.
This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.
The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
And we can predict what the sound will be.
And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.
It's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ...
It's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus.
So light is, of course, for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us.
And it is all about this planet.
Because all this light here goes up to the sky.
It never is to the benefit of people.
Now we have LED, but here you see the latest one, and you see how incredibly small it is.
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity, because this tiny, tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it.
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity, because this tiny, tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it.
And the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant.
I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting.
What just happened? What will be happening in the next five minutes?
And I'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say, "Oh, I know that like the back of my hand."
Okay, there's a few that chocolate can't fix.
But I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar.
But I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar.
In fact, they welcomed me.
I write musicals; I make short films alongside my poems.
I'm so lucky that there's this archive of performances that I can share with my students.
That was a great day for my mother.
This is a geep, a goat-sheep hybrid.
Some of you may have read about the FDA's consideration right now of genetically-engineered salmon.
The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon, using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat, to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed.
And what they've done here is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top, and it's on a big computer tracking ball.
But it's the closest they can get to a landing.
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed that this creature -- this is a moth -- this is the moth in its pupa stage, and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology, so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth, it is already prewired.
This is a brain from a lamprey eel.
This is a brain from a lamprey eel.
It is living -- fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides, attached photosensitive sensors to the brain, put it into a cart -- here's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle -- and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart, when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart, the cart moves toward the light;
This is where we are in this process.
Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us and say, "Look, I want a dog.
There's a piece by a composer, an American composer called John Cage.
It's called "Aria."
You see there are different lines.
To me, this piece is an ode to the voice, because it's mysterious, as we can see.
A simple idea, but it could have such far-reaching consequences.
Mind your language.
AK: The ancestor of the horse.
Hahahaha.
So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology --  to turn nouns into verbs.
BJ: Okay so.
And 20 years later, miraculously, we collaborated with a company from Mali, the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako, where we made a piece about a tall giraffe.
AK: It seemed a lovely idea.
BJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider.
We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones.
AK: We were terrified.
AK: We were terrified.
BJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.
This is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir.
And I had the same reaction you did.
This is Beau Awtin.
But we do have the first three minutes.
In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures.
If you don't get an opening shock, you don't get a parachute -- you've got a whole new problem set.
So you look around, where you're going to land, you try to make yourself ready.
Probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference, the ages, had changed so much.
And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger.
Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful.
It's probably more powerful than marriage vows.
Because if compassion was a chore, nobody's going to do it, except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.
In Google, expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern.
It's sort of a funny pattern.
And sometimes it gets big enough to become official.
So what are they?
And this is the first compelling business benefit.
Have you ever tried to see that if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes?
Look where my belief had brought me to.
Thank you.

Yes, it is a scrambled egg.
And we've crossed our first threshold.
The universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom.
It's incredibly hot.
It contains everything that's in today's universe, so you can imagine, it's busting.
Within the first second, energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity.
Now I want to pause for a moment, 380,000 years after the origins of the universe, because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage.
We know above all that it was extremely simple.
When very large stars die, they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations, to form all the elements of the periodic table.
And DNA also copies itself.
Let me explain why.
We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years.
And now, finally -- this is what I want.
A restaurant -- you might not want to just read about it, maybe you want to go to the restaurant.
Here's a great article about an important election race that's happening.
It's voluntary.
He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.
Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?"
I managed to convince him that it was important for us, but possibly also for other people that he shared his story.
Maybe I wasn't as smart, but I was at least as talkative.
It knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark.
This is the first version of my computer voice.
There are several very good voices available for computers, but they all sound like somebody else, while this voice sounds like me.
So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming.
I bought a tractor -- then it broke.
Here, I'll give you an example.
What do you think about that scene?
They have all the right pieces of the puzzle, and they are too moronic to put them together correctly.
That is not true, and if it were, life would be incredibly boring.
The miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is.

And we'd come in from playing, he'd come in from plowing and working, and we'd sit around that table every night.
And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table, I began to call it the wisdom table.
And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table, I began to call it the wisdom table.
And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office, and it reminds me of him.
The project I'm going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game, and essentially it is also an empty space.
But the film has really gone places.
You know that teacher?
I'll make something -- I didn't say interactive; we didn't have that term in 1978 -- but something interactive.
And so we made the game, and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure.
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them.
"Let's ask that mom to read the letter.
I had bought a copy of this book, "The Universe and Dr. Einstein" -- a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle.
A few years after that, in Bangalore, I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night, and I picked up this book, thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes.
And that feeling hasn't left me yet.
I have been basically spending the last few years documenting the efforts of some extremely intrepid men and women who are putting, literally at times, their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos in order for us to understand this universe.
And neutrinos you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molecules.
So this is the Russians working on the ice in the peak of the Siberian winter.
And here we are about to board our bus.
Now, in case the weather changes before the launch, they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to McMurdo Station.
The fabric alone weighs two tons.
In order to minimize the weight, it's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper.
In order to minimize the weight, it's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper.
Now people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs.
Now we all know the crime rate in our neighborhood, because we live there, and we get a feeling about it that basically matches reality.
So this model is an intelligent representation of reality.
We couldn't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them.
Our model of security around electricity is something we were born into.
Intuitive is just another word for familiar.
When swine flu first appeared, the initial news caused a lot of overreaction.
So there was that feeling of lack of control.
And there's kind of a bifurcation -- people had to choose between fear and acceptance -- actually fear and indifference -- they kind of chose suspicion.
An example, a great example, is the risk of smoking.
But 80 years, we're just not good at.
And I lied.
1982 -- I don't know if people will remember this -- there was a short epidemic of Tylenol poisonings in the United States.
And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish?
There are natural biological materials.
There are natural biological materials.
And they can pull calcium out of the environment, put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.
And that battery went to the White House for a press conference.
I brought it here.
Or, we can scroll through the pages at the bottom.
This photo, you can you can even see on an interactive map.
And some of these models -- so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube, you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint.
And they have some wonderful properties.
You can just pull this out, this becomes a rectangle.
But this is very shaky.
Look at the pentagon, for instance, pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium.
Look at the pentagon, for instance, pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium.
This square might look very square and prim.
Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus.
Ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in India, they might not have gone to engineering college, but no one makes a roof placed like this.
It's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon.
We made 30,000.
So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations.
The first day, it was a huge umbrella cap, like a captain's cap.
That night, when the passengers would be sleeping, he would give it one more fold, and the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap -- with a little shoot just like a designer cap, because it protects the spinal cord.
And the third day, it would be a Shikari cap -- just like an adventurer's cap.
And there's a third one over here.
Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship.
And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally, or you can use the wet material to form it around a three-dimensional shape.
So what I want to do is say to a future bug, "Spin me a thread.
Align it in this direction.
Make it hydrophobic.
Which tells you something about our place in the universe.
It's a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly.
Boltzmann gave us a formula -- engraved on his tombstone now -- that really quantifies what entropy is.
The reason the problem has gotten worse, rather than better, is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before.
The universe is not only expanding.
If you look at the galaxy, it's moving away.
And this energy, according to Einstein, exerts a push on the universe.
Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes, space looks finite to us.
Finally, empty space has a temperature.
But that's a probabilistic statement.
Even if you imagine that this room we are in now exists and is real and here we are, and we have, not only our memories, but our impression that outside there's something called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy, it's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain than for them actually to randomly fluctuate into Caltech, the United States and the galaxy.
Feynman says, "From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation, all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before, we will find it mixed up, and not like the piece we've just looked at -- high entropy.
The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so.
An egg, an unbroken egg, is a low entropy configuration, and yet, when we open our refrigerator, we do not go, "Hah, how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator."
This is a prediction. I might be wrong.
Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth.
Their relationship is a love story that feeds the Earth.
And many scientists believe it's the most serious issue facing mankind.
If they disappear, so do we.
And that's where I became truly obsessed with this polar realm.
Because National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time: they publish pictures, not excuses.
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
So really what the ice does is it acts like a garden.
This whale could have been born around the start of the Industrial Revolution.
All the leopard seal was doing -- it's just biting a balloon.
And even in his voice, he goes, "That's a bloody big seal, ya."
And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth.
What had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me, and she did that to threat display.
So this material is silk.
And so we marvel at silk worms -- the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber.
They find their way to self-assemble.
And so what does that mean?
So we tried something out, and we wrote a message in a piece of silk, which is right here, and the message is over there.
And so what does that mean, that it's biodegradable and biocompatible?
You ask why?
There was a theory.
The first one was that when helium atoms touch each other, they repel.
He wrote down a simple thing.
Because they're moving real fast, relativity says the internal motions go very slow.
There's a certain alga that swims in the wild, and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally.
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about.
It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning -- where a tone ends with a brief shock.
Now the question is, what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear?
And so you're stuck on a bus.
The brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy.
But the bridges that we saw that opened and closed -- I'm slightly squeamish -- but I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball.
And what we found -- this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain.
The finished project is meant to be more than just a power station.
It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top.
They're just chopped at different heights.
This optic was 22 feet long.
Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy.
But about 10 percent of the time, after the patient has recovered from one of those events, pain persists.
So imagine, if you will, that I'm stroking your arm with this feather, as I'm stroking my arm right now.
Now you would probably imagine, as she did, that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life.
You can see that the arm is discolored, purplish in color.
The nervous system has plasticity.
I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence.
I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs.
So why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light?
The flash is like a scream for help.
There's a lot of animals that use this trick, for example this black dragonfish.
It's got a chin barbel.
This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this.
And we have a pretty good idea, for most of them, why.
It's a green saber of light.
And I can't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in, because there's bait right there.
This is a stronger knot.
It will come untied less often.
We made a music video for one of my favorite bands, Radiohead.
Collaborator Five: As much as is different from frame to frame, it really is personal.
And below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project.
If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails, you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located.
And this is called "The Wilderness Downtown."
So the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up.
This is a great technology.
This virus can only survive in people.
It can't live for a very long time in people.
Now we don't have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this, to eradicating diseases.
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after.
The second challenge we had was -- in contrast to the smallpox vaccine, which was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life -- the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile.
But the third challenge we have -- and probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge -- is that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy -- every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash.
And at the same time, the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas.
It's been working to help control pandemic flu, SARS for example.
And then to make the matters even worse, the virus started to spread out of these four places, especially northern India and northern Nigeria, into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe, causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades.
And then, in one of the most important, tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world, we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have.
We think children deserve better.
The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had, and we immediately started using this.
Well, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production.
Over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio -- Uttar Pradesh and Bihar -- 500,000 children every single month.
That's what it costs to reach 500 million children.
The book is written by an Iranian woman, Shahrnush Parsipur.
This book is banned, and she spent five years in prison.
and independence from the foreign interventions.
The green movement significantly inspired the world.
But the secular-minded people can be influenced by that.
And they looked back at Islamic tradition, they saw that there are problematic aspects, but they're not the core of the religion, so maybe they can be re-understood, and the Koran can be reread in the modern world.
We have already an autonomous vehicle.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
For that, we use an initial measurement unit.
Well there comes the first box.
You must be out of your mind."
This is a project we're working on right now with a very healthy deadline.
In this case, "Keeping a Diary Supports Personal Development" -- I've been keeping a diary since I was 12.
If you think that way, you have a Platonist moral framework.
Suppose I go up and I say, "I'm going to take your phone."
Suppose I go up and I say, "I'm going to take your phone."
But they can't.
♫ Dum ta da da dum dum ta da da dum ♫ Well, your musician friend will stop you and say, "You know, the theme music for your data revolution, that's an opera, that's Wagner.
I mean, I assume everyone here has seen "Jurassic Park."
And B-rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock.
It wasn't a very complete T. rex, and it wasn't a very big T. rex, but it was a very special B-rex.
But Mary went further.
And try and try, we could not find DNA, but she did find evidence of proteins.
But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.
Found the protein collagen.
I mean, it was wonderful stuff.
The chicken is a dinosaur.
Transgenesis is really cool too.
That's how people make GloFish.
But the cool thing is that, if you look in the embryo, as the embryo is developing the hand actually looks pretty much like the archaeopteryx hand.
Birds have basically rudimentary tails.
And so we know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail.
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.
So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken, modify it and make the chickenosaurus.
And quite frankly, I think if Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it, he could actually advertise an extra piece.
Fourteen years ago, I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet, used the same way for centuries.
This intersection had been bland and anonymous.
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean.
So I replaced the metal armature with a soft, fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.
From all outward appearances, John had everything going for him.
And I would argue, in the future, we'll have wearable devices in our clothes, monitoring ourselves 24/7.
And just like we have the OnStar system in cars, your red light might go on -- it won't say "check engine" though.
You can swallow this completely integrated device.
This is a new device that is essentially doing that.
So if you think of cancer as a weed, we often can whack the weed away.
In fact, we devalue play.
It's 45 years of it that's created what I call the "baba factor."
What happens then?
Well I'm going to say no.
For example, it stimulates creativity.
It increases our openness to change.
There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play, besides the serious meme that we have to kick out.
Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you, you need to rediscover play.
Lunch is like the recess for work.
But mostly ...

Well the answer is the science of radio astronomy.
Radio could carry sound without wires.
A mysterious persistent noise was disrupting their research.
It was in the microwave range, and it appeared to be coming from all directions simultaneously.
Is it the Zetas? The drug traffickers? The government?
Daily life in our country is, to say the least, under extraordinary, exceptional circumstances.
They mobilized the whole community of Le Barón to go to Chihuahua, where they organized a sit-in in the central park of the city.
But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans.
Given the computer model, we can test the model by essentially quizzing it.
We found that the Indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts.
What does this result really show?
So for example the first text: there's a doubling of this jar-shaped sign.
The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion that the Indus script probably does represent language.
Why should we care?
And it's got this funny horn-shaped thing, which as far as I know, again, the first cookbook to ever do this.
Anyway, here's the book.
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects.
And sure enough, there's the insect.
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.
This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot.
And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.
And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting.
So watching all of this show from outer space, you think we get it, we understand that the most precious resource on the blue planet is our consciousness.
While I was producing in Los Angeles, I never thought about it for a second.
I didn't feel empty; I felt everything simultaneously.
This is a gamma radiation spec scan that uses gamma radiation to map three-dimensional function within the brain.
I've brought with me, from Southern California, the FM device.
This is it being held in the hand.
Five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin.
Where does it go inside the body?
It has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free for over 80 years.
Here are the implantation sites.
And this records every single step I've taken for, ooh, five or six years now.
That little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on.
That little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on.
Underneath my heel, there is a sensor that detects when my foot leaves the ground -- what's called the heel lift.
This thing blinks all the time; I'll leave it out, so you might be able to see it.
But this is blinking all the time. It's sending signals in real time.
And if you walk faster, if I walk faster, it detects what's called the time interval, which is the interval between each heel lift.
But there's millions of deaf people in the world, and the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now.
I should clarify that.
Fast-forward more than two decades: Apple launches the iPhone in China and censors the Dalai Lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the Chinese government for its Chinese app store.
So the important question, I think, is not this debate over whether the Internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.
In the age of globalization, we moved on.
The age of behavior: where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior and identity and allegiances.
And a social movement is comprised, in my view, it's comprised of four main characteristics.
But generally, the trends that start in Egypt have historically spread across the MENA region, the Middle East and North Africa region.
Now I'm an economist, I'm not a doctor, but I see the God complex around me all the time in my fellow economists.
I see it in our business leaders.
And they are brilliant; it's wonderful work.
But a typical Hans Rosling graph: think for a moment, not what it shows, but think instead about what it leaves out.
He's at MIT.
And after 45 generations, you have this incredible nozzle.
It looks a bit like a chess piece -- functions absolutely brilliantly.
The U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy.
And there's this huge hubbub.
So shortly after the war, this young man, Yutaka Taniyama, developed this amazing conjecture called the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture.
It turned out to be absolutely instrumental many decades later in proving Fermat's Last Theorem.
And I would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen.
It's true.
Think about all the services we use, all the connectivity, all the entertainment, all the business, all the commerce.
I mean, the Internet is international.
Now, if you'll take a look at this image file -- well there's the image header, and there the actual code of the attack starts.
And that code has been encrypted, so let's decrypt it.
You just have to believe me, it is, it is.
And I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original.
That code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature.
And 78 is the city code for the city of St. Petersburg.
The self was not constant.
We'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing.
But there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection -- and that thing is oneness, our essence.
All my senses are alert and alive in much the same way as an infant might feel -- that feeling of oneness.
And when I realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function, a funny thing happened.
I stopped giving it so much authority.
I give it its due.
Let's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness.
This is a photograph by the artist Michael Najjar, and it's real, in the sense that he went there to Argentina to take the photo.
And so -- this is an over-simplification -- but basically, it's not like you can just pass a radar signal right through 156 tons of steel in the sky.
It's not just going to disappear.
And the question is: Nobody was buying or selling anything; what was happening?
It's trying to get a grasp on you, on the firmware inside the human skull, so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next -- which is a very, very difficult problem.
And you think of the Internet as this kind of distributed system.
And of course, it is, but it's distributed from places.
We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency.
Next thing we have to do, we have to control and regulate the whole structure.
And if that is the case, how come that it's very hard to kill a city?
And the idea is can we do the same for this?
This is just a tiny range actually: It's us mammals; we're one of these.
Before I talk about that, I've written down at the bottom there the slope of this curve, this straight line.
But most important in this, the exponent, the analog to that three-quarters for the metabolic rate, is bigger than one -- it's about 1.15 to 1.2.
He said, "I did not sell a great masterpiece to that Nazi.
He had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually that.
And he boasted about all the great masterpieces that he himself had painted that were attributed to other artists.
It was not that painting, but that painting.
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine?
It's very simple: pour it from an expensive bottle.
But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff, parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree.
But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff, parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree.
But that was before she got Capgras syndrome.
Then we asked other groups of subjects -- we gave them different restrictions and different conditions.
That drops the value of it, suggesting that that's one reason why we like it.
That drops the value of it, suggesting that that's one reason why we like it.
I rarely find an audience where people can go back very far without that experience.
And this zero hunger program costs .5 percent of GDP and has lifted many millions of people out of hunger and poverty.
Differencing is another technique we use.
And RASA stands for Receive, which means pay attention to the person; Appreciate, making little noises like "hmm," "oh," "okay"; Summarize, the word "so" is very important in communication; and Ask, ask questions afterward.
That's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill.
Why is it not taught? It's crazy.
And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water.
And we even have to be asked sometimes, very kindly, to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons.
It's light, and light has been around for many millions of years.
And in fact, it has created us, has created life, has created all the stuff of life.
And wouldn't it be great to use that for wireless communications?
An LED is a semiconductor. It's an electronic device.
And it has a very nice acute property.
As you would expect, it's a light, a desk lamp.
Put your book beneath it and you can read.
It is this light that transmits this high-definition video in a split stream.
You don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude that we impress onto this light bulb.
And you see, even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver.
And the answer is yes.
Look around. Everywhere. Look at your smart phone.
It's a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other people's minds.
Languages are genes talking, getting things that they want.
According to that story, early humans developed the conceit that, by using their language to work together, they could build a tower that would take them all the way to heaven.
If I can learn by watching you, I can steal your best ideas, and I can benefit from your efforts, without having to put in the time and energy that you did into developing them.
This remarkable image is not a map of the world.
And when you plot those friendship links by their latitude and longitude, it literally draws a map of the world.
And so our modern world now is confronting us with a dilemma.
The reason why I don't believe that tells us that the Neanderthals had language is -- here's a simple analogy: Ferraris are cars that have engines.
What we've found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans.
I began to see my body like an iPad or a car.
I began to see my body like an iPad or a car.
I would drive it and demand things from it.
It had no limits. It was invincible.
It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself.
I didn't heed it; no, I organized it and I directed it.
Other women became mad, driven machines like me.
Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated.
It was proof that I had not measured up, that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape.
My stomach was proof that I had failed, that it had failed me, that it was broken.
Militias were raping six-month-old babies so that countries far away could get access to gold and coltan for their iPhones and computers.
So we brought her home, and I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach before she died.
It was all the lies that got told before and after.
It would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin.
About a year prior to this oil spill, a 17-year-old student had invented a degreaser.
But I realized that, having been messing around with structure as an actor, that a series of sound bites in itself wasn't enough, that there needed to be a mountain to climb, there needed to be a journey that I had to take.
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki.
And we have to make this day work.
I remember putting that film out and going to cynics.
And like the General Assembly, obviously the most wonderful, wonderful moment.
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back.
But more importantly, we wanted to go back, because these people in Afghanistan were the heroes.
And we gave the film over.
And we will utilize all kinds of things -- have a dance and social media and visiting on Facebook and visit the website, sign the petition.
Because together, by working together, I seriously think we can start to change things.
There we go.
When we see these little dips in the light, we can determine a number of things.
For one thing, we can determine that there's a planet there, but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star.
Just think, even when it's cloudy outside, these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time.
Just think, even when it's cloudy outside, these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time.
Kepler won't find a planet around every single star it looks at.
Art is a deception that creates real emotions -- a lie that creates a truth.
"Oh, don't worry about it," he said.
And to begin to answer such questions, my research group -- since over 25 years now -- works on methods to extract DNA from remains of Neanderthals and extinct animals that are tens of thousands of years old.
And this then, in conjunction with these methods that allow very many DNA molecules to be sequenced very rapidly, allowed us last year to present the first version of the Neanderthal genome, so that any one of you can now look on the Internet, on the Neanderthal genome, or at least on the 55 percent of it that we've been able to reconstruct so far.
And the first place we've done that is in Southern Siberia in the Altai Mountains at a place called Denisova, a cave site in this mountain here, where archeologists in 2008 found a tiny little piece of bone -- this is a copy of it -- that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky of a human.
You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.
You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.
It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems.
So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.
But first, compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering.
This is called resilience.
Many of us think that compassion drains us, but I promise you it is something that truly enlivens us.
Another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what's called neural integration.
I say that, for thousands of years, women have lived, exemplified, met in intimacy, the archetype of Avalokitesvara, of Kuan-Yin, she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world.
It's really a question of the system, how the ship was loaded, the ballast and many other things.
So the 20th century, then, saw how much more complex reality was, but it also saw a positive side.
It saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies.
But within that infrastructure, we have to remember that the driving force of biology is really coming from evolution.
So here's some inorganic life.
And the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing.
But what does a cell do?
But what else is life characterized by?
And so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating, metabolizing, burning through chemistries.
And so we have to understand that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life, we need to power it somehow.
And they had a look at what was in the soup, and they found amino acids, but nothing came out, there was no cell.
So that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution.
So imagine we make a little cell.
So imagine we make a little cell.
We want to put it out in the environment, and we want it to be powered by the Sun.
We should take our inspiration from biology.
And I want to share with you my latest art project.
It's a children's book for the iPad.
It's a little quirky and silly.
If you look at the statistical evidence worldwide, there's really no support for the idea that authoritarian governments hold a systematic edge over democracies in terms of economic growth.
And so I went home, and I made a prototype of this hat.
What kind of an experience do they have?
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener.
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.
And so jumping off of that, thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world, I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls -- which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols.
And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice.
But in fact, if I were to place one base on each pixel of this 1280x800-resolution screen, we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome.
So it's really quite big.
Think of it -- it's 2016, and the leading candidate releases not only her four years of back-tax returns, but also her personal genome.
Now I happen to make my living these days in television, so for me, that's a good thing.
They, in fact, berate it.
They call it stupid, and worse, believe me.
Only one generation, 20 years in, and we discovered, Wow! TV can do that?
It can make me feel this?
And the result is an even bigger divergence in a very short space of time than happened in Germany.
Now if those books are not lost to history, then they are somewhere in a library, and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by Google, which has scanned 15 million books to date.
Now we've got the data, plus we have metadata.
Suddenly, in the mid-40s, there started to be a buzz.
Culturomics is similar.
Everyone's familiar with cancer, but we don't normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease.
A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo.
The Tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes.
That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat.
We think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor, get into the saliva.
So this Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer.
So this Tasmanian devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate cancer.
It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it.
And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells, so is this dog cancer.
We also believe this cancer might be very old.
This cancer is remarkable.
It's the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of.
Now in order for us to really chew on information and do something with it, we have to engage at least two of those modalities, or we have to engage one of those modalities coupled with an emotional experience.
My friends, the doodle has never been the nemesis of intellectual thought.
And Laennec thought this would be a wonderful way to listen to the chest or listen to the abdomen using what he called "the cylinder."
I remember so many huge, hollowed out, haunted eyes staring up at me as I performed this ritual.
It's an idea for a new kind of school, which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking about what schools are for and how they work.
We the children had gathered at a friend's house.
I mean, today, Singapore is a First World country and Ghana is not.
And not only that, I am documenting it -- documenting my own cultural shortcomings.
Now here's an interesting comparison.
The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep, proving that the African is capable of governing himself.
How do you know that something is good for us or bad for us?
Trials are very old. The first trial was in the Bible -- Daniel 1:12.
Because if you already know the answer to your trial, you shouldn't be doing one.
And yet, repeatedly, you consistently see people doing trials still against placebo.
So people set about doing trials of these new drugs against the old drugs, but they gave the old drugs in ridiculously high doses -- 20 milligrams a day of haloperidol.
It's at the top of the pyramid of evidence.
♫ I don't understand myself, ♫ ♫ why they keep talking of love, ♫ ♫ if they come near me, ♫ ♫ if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand. ♫ ♫ I don't understand myself, ♫ ♫ why they talk of magic, ♫ ♫ that no one withstands, ♫ ♫ if he sees me, if he passes by. ♫ ♫ But if the red light is on ♫
So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years.
It grows up into the adult stage like that and then goes through a Benjamin Button phase, and actually goes backwards and backwards until it's like a little embryo again, and then actually grows back up, and back down and back up -- sort of yo-yo -- and it never dies.
It grows up into the adult stage like that and then goes through a Benjamin Button phase, and actually goes backwards and backwards until it's like a little embryo again, and then actually grows back up, and back down and back up -- sort of yo-yo -- and it never dies.
Anyone know?
And so if you go and ask yourself, "What on Earth is artificial life?", let me give you a whirlwind tour of how all this stuff came about.
And this was Steen Rasmussen.
And this type of activity goes on for quite awhile, until the main easy things have been acquired by these programs.
That is also very robust -- what you find in systems like Earth where there are amino acids, but there is no life.
Well we can make life. We can make life in the computer.
and then look for large deviations from this -- this thing sticking out, which says, "This chemical really shouldn't be there."
Now we don't know that there's life then, but we could say, "Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from."
And so that's really the only take-home message that I have for you.
In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here, we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space.
Well a good place to start is with waste.
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material.
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.
Up to and around about the Second World War, conductors were invariably dictators -- these tyrannical figures who would rehearse, not just the orchestra as a whole, but individuals within it, within an inch of their lives.
You end up like some kind of rabid windmill.
And how futile seemed the words of advice to me from great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis who said, "Conducting, Charles, is like holding a small bird in your hand.
And how futile seemed the words of advice to me from great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis who said, "Conducting, Charles, is like holding a small bird in your hand.
If you hold it too tightly, you crush it.
If you hold it too tightly, you crush it.
The piece was sung entirely in Xhosa, which is a beautifully musical language, if you don't know it.
I want to play you a tiny clip of it now for no other reason than to give you proof positive that there is nothing tiny about South African music making.
If you'll pardon the expression.
All right, why would we see this correlation?
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector, something you wouldn't ever think of to begin with, the detector will actually activate two out of three times.
AG: Now this is his next idea.
Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults, I think the best thing is think about cases where we're put in a new situation that we've never been in before -- when we fall in love with someone new, or when we're in a new city for the first time.
And from that point on, from my age at the time, I began to think of things in a different way.
And when I looked at it first, I thought, no, there's no beauty in that.
Would you mind taking the brain out, and I just want you to feel something.
And one of the most tedious ones, I think, was saying that beauty was about symmetry.
Now I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty if I look at that eye.
It is really -- I mean, I can't express to you how exquisite this object is.
But I also know why it's exquisite to me, because it's a palimpsest of things.
This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension.
It's not about the shapes, it's how the shapes reflect light.
That blip, that information, shot into you before that.
And because your brain starter motor began there, now it's got to deal with it.
So is that wrong?
It wins or loses at that point.
Form is function. Form is function.
The brain works by association.
And the way information is structured is totally incapable of keeping up with this process.
And he was reading it in their library in the Far East.
We developed a system such that it had a markup language based on html.
We're deeply ambivalent about the truth.
That's truth number two about lying.
We're against lying, but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries.
It's as old as breathing.
Lying has evolutionary value to us as a species.
That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky.
It's the only asymmetrical expression.
Our world is lit up 24 hours a day.
And this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year.
And in a traditional American funeral, a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive.
It's a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife.
I'm wearing the second prototype of this burial suit.
They said, "Please, don't bring anyone with a degree and qualification into your college."
We're trying to heat up the space that we're in, and all that is trying to get out through the window.
We're trying to heat up the space that we're in, and all that is trying to get out through the window.
Wouldn't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in?
Knowing that we're not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power, we went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas, and we gave them this diagram.
And what they built was eBox.
And what they built was eBox.
It's my energy.
We're simply not going to do that.
I've carried this photograph with me every day since then.
These are motorized devices that are controlled by little electrical signals from your muscle.
Now this is a research arm, but it's made out of commercial components from here down and a few that I've borrowed from around the world.
So we've developed a small microcomputer that is blinking somewhere behind her back and is operating this all by the way she trains it to use her individual muscle signals.
So Amanda, when you first started using this arm, how long did it take to use it?
AK: It took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train.
I had to hook it up to a computer, so I couldn't just train it anywhere.
So if it stopped working, I just had to take it off.
Here's Amanda using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation.
TK: That's Claudia, and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic.
Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us.
Meanwhile, I use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this, that function still in the sense of being a three-dimensional weather visualization, but now they're embedding the visual matrix of the musical score, so it can actually be read as a musical score.
What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art, versus science.
This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it.
This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it.
You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture.

You place it in a science museum, it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data.
You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others.
But look at the scale of the differences.
There's a about a tenfold difference there, log scale up the side.
And of course, those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society.
Now I cannot tell you how incredibly excited the U.S. military was by the news of the Norden bombsight.
And what did the Norden bombsight do?
Well it allowed you to do that.
And they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath, to swear that if they're ever captured, they will not divulge a single detail of this particular device to the enemy, because it's imperative the enemy not get their hands on this absolutely essential piece of technology.
And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane, it's escorted there by a series of armed guards.
It's never allowed to be photographed.
So what happens during the Second World War?
And of course, in wartime, conditions aren't perfect.
And not all of the people who are of those 50,000 men who are bombardiers have the ability to properly program an analog computer.
Secondly, it breaks down a lot.
It's the drone. What is the drone?
Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.
Now, BRD4 is an interesting protein.
You might ask: with all the things cancer's trying to do to kill our patient, how does it remember it's cancer?
When it winds up its genome, divides into two cells and unwinds again, why does it not turn into an eye, into a liver, as it has all the genes necessary to do this?
So what next?
We have this molecule, but it's not a pill yet.
It's not orally bioavailable.
This research is funded by the public.
So of course, it took time, and I was nearly 40, and I decided it's time to start as an artist.
I chose papercutting because paper is cheap, it's light, and you can use it in a lot of different ways.
One story leads to another.
It's two panels 13 ft. high.
They were installed in the museum on two floors, but in fact, it's a continuous image.
They were installed in the museum on two floors, but in fact, it's a continuous image.
The other thing that's also interesting that's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- and it doesn't matter who they are -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information, or restricted access to information.
And the reason their information has any value is, well, because no one else has access to it.
started doing this, we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up.
So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete.
So in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete.
I want to know if there was a moral molecule.
After 10 years of experiments, I found it.
This little syringe contains the moral molecule.
It is," he said, "only a female molecule.
I just found the molecule behind it.
But knowing that molecule is valuable, because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off.
So one Sunday afternoon, a man walks into my cashier's booth with this beautiful jewelry box.
within the light sport aircraft category.
Test Pilot: Until the vehicle flies, 75 percent of your risk is that first flight.
Doesn't matter if it rains a little, you have a windshield wiper.
That problem is solved.
And the student has trained this robot to pour this water into a glass.
Now the Americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking.
Now by noise, I do not mean sound.
But more generally, this noise is something that corrupts the signal.
And I've put the formula up there.
I'm not going to explain what that formula is, but it's very beautiful.
And it has real beauty and real explanatory power.
So let me give you an intuitive example.
And I want to convince you the brain does make predictions of the sensory feedback it's going to get.
You might have a little predictor, a neural simulator, of the physics of your body and your senses.
So as I shake this ketchup bottle, I get some true sensory feedback as the function of time in the bottom row.
So I get two sources.
So I get two sources.
And so we decided the most obvious place to start was with tickling.
And what we see in all pairs of subjects is this -- a 70 percent escalation in force on each go.
You have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision.
You have to study vision with the realization of how the movement system is going to use vision.
And so what we do is, we start simple and we work our way up to living systems.
Consider for a moment this quote by Leduc, a hundred years ago, considering a kind of synthetic biology: "The synthesis of life, should it ever occur, will not be the sensational discovery which we usually associate with the idea."
This is natural from the environment, this clay.
But if you saw this protocell, you would not confuse this with something that was actually alive.
You add the droplet to the system.
It's a pool of water, and the protocell starts moving itself around in the system.
As we heard earlier, movement is very important in these kinds of living systems.
It is moving around, exploring its environment, and remodeling its environment, as you see, by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.
So I add some food source to the system.
The protocell moves. It encounters the food.
It can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to sustain itself.
And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust, and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.
So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it, thinking it was some crap laying around.
But as soon as they passed by, it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.
So this work is a caricature of an upside-down man.
So I'll just show you an instance -- so when people enter the room, it activates this object.
And this is an important moment, because we wanted to instill in the viewer an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.
So this work was a real technical challenge for us, and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.
So this work was a real technical challenge for us, and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.
That's my colleague. He's let it go.
Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.
Well imagine a small cube that's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room, and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.
Well imagine a small cube that's about this big standing in front of you in the middle of the room, and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you by growing into a cube that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it -- almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something.
So we work with a lot of technology, but we don't really love technology, because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.
So we work with a lot of technology, but we don't really love technology, because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.
But we use it because we're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create.
I'd like to start with a short story.
Let's fast-forward to the San Francisco Bay Area many decades later, where I started a technology company that brought the world its first 3D laser scanning system.
Let me leave you with a final thought.
Our heritage is much more than our collective memory -- it's our collective treasure.
So let's take a look at the brain.
Most people, when they first look at a fresh human brain, they say, "It doesn't look what you're typically looking at when someone shows you a brain."
There's the cerebellum; that's keeping you upright right now.
And in Seattle, we take these -- this is a whole human hemisphere -- and we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer.
There's a blade here that's going to cut across a section of the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide.
From this, we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces, which then we can put on a smaller cryostat.
This is 20 microns thin, so this is about a baby hair's width.
We take that tissue, we purify the RNA out of it using some basic technology, and then we put a florescent tag on it.
Here's the MR. It provides the framework.
We don't need a reason.
We don't need a reason.
BG: So the wings have their own parachute, and you have your two parachutes.
I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit, so I decided to make the app.
So we're getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they'd like.
And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.
So the first thing you're going to see is the normal worm when it's about college student age -- a young adult.
So this animal is going to live twice as long.
And now here is the daf-2 mutant.
So what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell.
That's what that arrow means.
That's what that arrow means.
The receptor isn't working as well.
The receptor isn't working as well.
You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.
So FOXO turns on a lot of genes.
And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes, genes I call carrot-giver genes, whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well -- to fold correctly and function correctly.
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients.
So maybe he's a little bit lazy, but he's there, he's taking care of the building.
And they all come and they fortify the house.
And then the hurricane comes through, and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.
But in this case, there's already a drug called rapamycin that binds to the TOR protein and inhibits its activity.
Let me get this straight.
This is a wonderful thing.
That's the strong anthropic principle of vacuuming.
I'm sitting on a chair.
In a hospital, this device could be used to carry around medical equipment.
Now during this time, the book was the king of storytelling.
It was venerable.
It was ubiquitous.
Their beauty immerses us with color, taste, touch.
Beauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival, because we protect what we fall in love with.
Beauty and seduction is nature's tools for survival, because we protect what we fall in love with.
So I have a gift I want to share with you today, a project I'm working on called Happiness Revealed, and it'll give us a glimpse into that perspective from the point of view of a child and an elderly man Child: When I watch TV, it's just some shows that you just -- that are pretend, and when you explore, you get more imagination than you already had, and when you get more imagination,
We so rarely look at the sky.
That didn't happen to me.
I got my tattoo when I was 29, and I regretted it instantly.
So if, in fact, you want to live a life free of regret, there is an option open to you.
So in other words, regret requires two things.
It requires, first of all, agency -- we had to make a decision in the first place.
So let's say for instance that you're on your way to your best friend's wedding and you're trying to get to the airport and you're stuck in terrible traffic, and you finally arrive at your gate and you've missed your flight.
We're not trying to understand how the problem came about.
So it's been several years since I got my own tattoo.
Actually, you know what, I should warn you, you're going to be disappointed.
I didn't tattoo Marilyn Manson's face on some indiscreet part of myself or something.
When other people see my tattoo, for the most part they like how it looks.
And as I said earlier, I'm a perfectionist.
Specifically the two things I learned about myself that I most didn't want to forget was how important it felt to keep exploring and, simultaneously, how important it is to somehow keep an eye on your own true north.
And what I loved about this image of the compass was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image.
Well it did.
But it turns out, it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would; it reminds me constantly of something else instead.
Now he confused me from the very start, because light doesn't cool things down.
Now a laser is different.
It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized, and if you focus them into a beam, what you have is an incredibly useful tool.
And the atoms themselves are quite violent, but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency, an atom will briefly absorb those photons and tend to slow down.
It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas.
The atoms lose their individual identity, and the rules from the quantum world take over, and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties.
For example, if you shine light through a superfluid, it is able to slow photons down to 60 kilometers per hour.
Of course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them.
They do it by changing their shape.
However, despite this incredible facility that some cochlear implant users display with language, you turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can't hear music almost at all.
Now there are a lot of reasons for that.
Music is entirely different.
And you can see on this figure, that the frequency range and the decibel range, the dynamic range of music is far more heterogeneous.
Now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation.
Now my goal in showing you that is to show you that music is not robust to degradation.
So for whatever reason, this implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices during melody perception.
Well, people power has been there for a while.
It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India, it helped Martin Luther King win his historic racial struggle.
We are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used.
You can tell that something is happening there.
And you can always use humor.
We're watching the great example of something else the Internet can do.
That thing is called a CAPTCHA.
You've seen those things, right? Like a book?
So the next time you type a CAPTCHA, these words that you're typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize.
And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because, you see, one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book, it didn't know what it was, and it's going to present it to you.
We don't tell you which one's which, and we say, please type both.
For example, we presented this word.
It's the word "Christians"; there's nothing wrong with it.
So people really, really want to learn a new language.
But at all times, you're learning by doing.
People really can learn a language with it.
So people really do learn a language.
The problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world's population doesn't have 500 dollars.
They're very repetitive, and they're very rich in the amino acids glycine and alanine.
At the top of the screen, you're seeing the repeat unit from the dragline silk of a garden argiope spider.
Now, it's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body.
So silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility.
In the case of the capture spiral, it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey.
This is the dragline spun by scytodes, the spitting spider.
So the idea of a mistake: From the perspective of a jazz musician, it's easier to talk about someone else's mistake.
And we won't react to it.
And do you know where the operating room is?
We heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society, what a pressing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute.
That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient's on the table.
I couldn't when I was working on this.
But here it is. It's fluorescent.
We can tell in the operating room, in the field, at a molecular level, where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out.
The light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue.
So that's the beauty of having a tumor that's labeled with fluorescent molecules.
So what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer, the woman would be saved from having unnecessary surgery.
So if you're driving on the freeway and you want to know where's the next gas station, you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road.
So clearly there was a problem with deforestation.
We decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar -- so in this case, we have carrot cake.
We decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar -- so in this case, we have carrot cake.
So yeah, we're transforming things into something that you have absolutely no reference for.
BR: And it's definitely the world's first bleeding veggie burger, which is a cool side effect.
BR: And it's definitely the world's first bleeding veggie burger, which is a cool side effect.
And a miracle berry, if you're not familiar with it, is a natural ingredient, and it contains a special property.
And a miracle berry, if you're not familiar with it, is a natural ingredient, and it contains a special property.
It's a glycoprotein called miraculin, a naturally occurring thing. It still freaks me out every time I eat it, but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue, so that primarily sour taste receptors, so normally things that would taste very sour or tart, somehow begin to taste very sweet.
Let's just stop and think about the economic benefits of something like that.
BR: So you see us here cutting up some watermelon. The idea with this is that we're going to eliminate tons of food miles, wasted energy, and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna, or any exotic produce or item from a very far-away place, with local, organic produce; so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin.
HC: So if miracle berries take sour things and turn them into sweet things, we have this other pixie dust that we put on the watermelon, and it makes it go from sweet to savory.
So after we do that, we put it into a vacuum bag, add a little bit of seaweed, some spices, and we roll it, and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna.
HC: So the key thing to remember here is, we don't really care what this tuna really is.
I flew out in front of the car, and then he ran over my legs.
My left leg got caught up in the wheel well -- spun it around.
It's your major artery, and it was severed, so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth.
I had no idea what was going on, but strangers intervened, kept my heart moving, beating.
I had no idea what was going on, but strangers intervened, kept my heart moving, beating.
Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover.
So one of the seniors just came up to me, and she pushed me up to the corner and she said, "When you think it's time to go, just stick the cane out there.
And as a blind person, your visual memory fades and is replaced with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell.
So I was walking around it.
And I go, "I'm just going to touch it."
And I go, "I'm just going to touch it."
All the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience, this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation, has got major controversies.
All the way back into early philosophy and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience, this has been one mystery that has always resisted elucidation, has got major controversies.
So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy the brain is.
The self is really the elusive problem.
But the novelty is here.
And he's standing on the deck of his ship, he's talking to his first mate, and he's saying, "Tomorrow, we will sail past those rocks, and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called Sirens.
I mean, let's face it, the present self is present.
It's in control. It's in power right now.
You're just telling yourself, "Without you, commitment device, I am nothing, I have no self-discipline."
I think self-discipline is something, it's like a muscle.
I think self-discipline is something, it's like a muscle.
The present self does not want to save at all.
For many years, we were just providing them with artificial limbs.
And they are asking -- we should all be asking -- how do we use this time?
I don't want to romanticize aging.
Neil Selinger, to me, is the embodiment of mounting the staircase in his third act.
For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation.
The globalization of power -- we talk about the globalization of markets, but actually it's the globalization of real power.
The world needs an international forum.
The poem is called "No Man is an Island."
The poem is called "No Man is an Island."
However, it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab -- so I could finally start my project.
The first stage was completed at home, which consisted of marinating the chicken, grilling the chicken, amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab.
So ovarian cancer is one of those cancers that most people don't know about, or at least don't pay that much attention to.
Well basically that means that this protein is changing from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell.
It was about inspiration and determination and never giving up on my interest for science and learning and growing.
So today I want to show you my interactive software model that I created.
Because these environmental solutions that Julie can make in her home, her workplace and her school are impacting everyone that lives around her.
So what can we learn from all of this?
The diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication.
There was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get.
That means there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place, no need to use reagents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information.
The 20th century was a great time to be a media company, because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity.
If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them, that's not okay.
These industries will not be content with breaking our Internet.
Now this view is not particularly new, actually.
It has quite a long lineage.
And here you can see an engineer -- it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer -- create a product in 3D.
In this case, we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS.
So who's using it?
And it's used by aerospace and automotive.
And then taking this idea of creating a very detailed structure, we can apply it to honeycomb structures and use them within implants.
So as you can see, this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic.
Because, simply, most of us here today don't know how to create the data that a 3D printer reads.
Because, simply, most of us here today don't know how to create the data that a 3D printer reads.
There's no need to do a run of thousands of millions or send that product to be injection molded in China.
This is the term that armies use when they've lost a battle.
As we know, our feelings about how we're feeling are notoriously unreliable.
In the game that we created, of course, you control the wooden form that's on the screen there with your mind.
This technology is intra-active.
At InteraXon, intra-active technology is one of our really defining mandates.
Humanizing technology is about taking what's already natural about the human-tech experience and building technology seamlessly in tandem with it.
So these stories together became the Herald Tribune business cover.
Let us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness.
Only brute force remained.
It was our last resort.
Such a state monopoly on violence, first of all, serves as a reassurance.
In cancer, cells rapidly divide and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth.
And when that cellular space station is within the electric field, it acts on those highly charged proteins and aligns them.
It's a medical device; it works when it's on.
But what we can see is, by month six, the tumor has responded and it's begun to melt away.
The first thing I want to do is start with a graph.
In the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine.
It needs an extremely well-trained anesthesiologist with years of training with complex machines to help her monitor the flows of the gas and keep her patients safe and anesthetized throughout the surgery.
It needs an extremely well-trained anesthesiologist with years of training with complex machines to help her monitor the flows of the gas and keep her patients safe and anesthetized throughout the surgery.
It's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms, and it needs special care, TLC, to keep it up and running, and it's going to break pretty easily.
It's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms, and it needs special care, TLC, to keep it up and running, and it's going to break pretty easily.
But so in here when there's electricity, the oxygen concentrator takes in room air.
Now we know room air is gloriously free, it is abundant, and it's already 21 percent oxygen.
So all this concentrator does is take that room air in, filter it and send 95 percent pure oxygen up and across here where it mixes with the anesthetic agent.
Now before that mixture hits the patient's lungs, it's going to pass by here -- you can't see it, but there's an oxygen sensor here -- that's going to read out on this screen the percentage of oxygen being delivered.
And you do not need to be a highly trained, specialized anesthesiologist to use this machine, which is good because, in these rural district hospitals, you're not going to get that level of training.
This is an incredibly rugged machine.
It has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts.
And so it's not going to break very easily, but if it does, virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a hex wrench and a screwdriver.
This machine comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that I showed you earlier.
They have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in Baltimore.
So I've talked a lot about anesthesia, and I tend to do that.
I think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health.
So we're going to imagine we're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here.
So what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment.
And the cell on the right there fires whenever there's a boundary to the south, whether it's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart.
So together, it's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment -- a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you'd find on a map, but using triangles.
So we can put people in an MRI scanner and have them do a little video game like the one I showed you and look for this signal.
And that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car's actually there.
Maybe it's been towed.
Maybe it's been towed.
So one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of O.C. spray, oleoresin capsicum spray, pepper spray, by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced, what had happened and those sorts of issues.
And it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas.
The final toll of hostages is a little unclear, but it's certainly a few more than that, because there were other people who died over the next few days.

I think that women in this part of the world realize that culture is an important component to connect people both locally and regionally.
Girl: Uncle Khaled. Here, put on the headscarf.
So people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are.
The dome, that little dome, is growing really fast.
And Torosaurus, when we cut into it, has mature bone.
And everybody says, "A Triceratops and a Torosaurus can't possibly be the same animal because one of them's bigger than the other one."
We've taken this title of "leader" and treat it as something that one day we're going to deserve.
It's scary to think of ourselves as that powerful, frightening to think we can matter that much to other people.
No, I'm just joking.
The problem is, in my village, Oakland, in most of our villages, we don't see that connection.
And sharks used to come into the bay.
And the fishermen would tie a net off the headland, string it out along the other net.
It would often drown and suffocate.
That one, you can see that we tagged both off Kerry.
And basically it spent all its time, the last eight months, in Irish waters.
Now when we were out tagging our sharks, this is how we tagged them on the front of a RIB -- get in there fast -- occasionally the sharks do react.
And then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head, to the pier, I noticed some black slime on the front of the boat.
And I had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists.
So we rushed out to Blasket as soon as we heard there were sharks there and managed to find some sharks.
96 percent of them found it useful.
The TERA system was developed from Haiti with support of engineers in the region.
My colleague, Jason Peat, who runs this program, tells me it's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things.
Now you've probably heard about the Porcupine caribou herd in the context of its breeding ground in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
And even though this looks maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines, it's even more damaging in some ways.
The oil produced from either method produces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other oil.
This is one of the reasons why it's called the world's dirtiest oil.
And he said, "When you go out on the river, do not under any circumstances eat the fish.
So what we're doing is, we're taking the most concentrated greenhouse gas sink, twice as much greenhouse gases are sequestered in the boreal per acre than the tropical rainforests.
The tar sands could threaten not just a large section of the boreal.
But today, this thing is, I believe, a major player in the politics of the Middle East.
And by the time of his son Darius, the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control.
This empire is, in fact, the Middle East as we now know it, and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.
It was the largest empire the world had known until then.
Much more important, it was the first multicultural, multifaith state on a huge scale.
40 years on and we're in 1917, and the cylinder enters a different world.
And last year, the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time.
It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta.
And I want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures.
But not so with Márquez who once praised his translator's versions as being better than his own, which is an astonishing compliment.
So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa, had written his own book on the subject, I couldn't wait to read it.
It's highly recommended for anyone who's interested in the translator's art.
Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language.
Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language.
What I want to talk about is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has at circumventing our ingrained perspectives -- comedy as the philosopher's stone.
Now I'm big on speaking to people's self-interest because we're all wired for that.
And the result is great comedy that's also an information delivery system that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention than the professional news media.
You have given birth to an abomination.
Not to mention what it reveals about the adult who's speaking them.
And this cartoon hit the bull's eye.
Shortly after the conference was over, Joel got a request for a signed copy from the head of the EPA in Washington whose wall it now hangs on.
They cannot make savings easy.
If people frame mentally saving for retirement as a loss, they're not going to be saving for retirement.
Save More Tomorrow makes it easy.
Behavioral finance has a long way.
And so 10 years ago, an international program began called the Census of Marine Life, which set out to try and improve our understanding of life in the global oceans.
As you can see, these are the footprints of the different projects.
Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one.
But there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things.
But there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things.
One of the things that we're taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive.
Now this little critter, it's only about half a millimeter in size, not terribly charismatic.
But it was only discovered in the early 1980s.
The most exciting thing, I would say, about this census is the role of global science.
What this means is our economy is unsustainable.
Because that's what will stop: economic growth.
It will stop because of the end of trade resources.
When we think about economic growth stopping, we go, "That's not possible," because economic growth is so essential to our society that is is rarely questioned.
Although growth has certainly delivered many benefits, it is an idea so essential that we tend not to understand the possibility of it not being around.
And I'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes.
In response, some people argue, but we need growth, we need it to solve poverty.
We need it to develop technology.
When does this breakdown begin?
I know most people don't see it that way.
If you increase the speed of each of these rotors, then the robot flies up, it accelerates up.
Of course, if the robot were tilted, inclined to the horizontal, then it would accelerate in this direction.
So on the left, you see Daniel throwing this robot up into the air, and it shows you how robust the control is.
So what that effectively does, is produce a smooth and graceful motion.
So these are circular trajectories, where the robot pulls about two G's.
So as an academic, we're always trained to be able to jump through hoops and we get our robots to do that.
So here, you see the robot combining a motion that builds up momentum, and then changes its orientation and then recovers.
So just like a diver stands on a springboard and then jumps off it to gain momentum, and then does this pirouette, this two and a half somersault through and then gracefully recovers, this robot is basically doing that.
So his algorithm tells the robot what part to pick up, when, and where to place it.
So this robot is actually equipped with a camera, and a laser rangefinder, laser scanner.
So there is no global coordinate system.
The coordinate system is defined based on the robot, where it is and what it's looking at.
So I want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by Frank Shen and Professor Nathan Michael, that shows this robot entering a building for the very first time, and creating this map on the fly.
I can ask this robot to go in, create a map, and then come back and tell me what the building looks like.
So here, the robot is not only solving the problem of how to go from point A to point B in this map, but it's figuring out what the best point B is at every time.
I want to introduce the creators, Alex and Daniel, who created this video.
AS: What this scene is doing, and it did in the book, is it's fundamentally making a promise.
It's the invisible application that holds our attention to story.
Wonder is honest, it's completely innocent.
The total energy imbalance now is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter.
That may not sound like much, but when added up over the whole world, it's enormous.
It's about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity.
It would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control.
First reason is that no matter how many times people tell you, "If you want a great career, you have to pursue your passion, you have to pursue your dreams, you have to pursue the greatest fascination in your life," you hear it again and again, and then you decide not to do it.
"Look kid. I had a dream once, too, but -- So how are you going to finish the sentence with your "but"?
Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms, most of which we're very familiar with.
Durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness.
So here's the million-dollar question for social scientists like me: Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design?
Is it a product of natural selection, like our hands?
Well let me show you.
Well let me show you.
In other words, Charles Darwin believed in group selection.
The free-riders have taken over.
But there are solutions to the free-rider problem.
It's not that hard a problem.
And now let's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters and look what happens.
A superorganism can basically take what it wants.
And we are Homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection, as Darwin explained.
I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug, but if it is an adaptation, then the implications are profound.
It's about the eternal struggle between good and evil, and we all believe we're on the good team.
For instance, just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft.
Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law.
Your sisters would be perfect for this."
I define vulnerability as emotional risk, exposure, uncertainty.
Shame drives two big tapes -- "never good enough" -- and, if you can talk it out of that one, "who do you think you are?"
It's uncomfortable, but it's adaptive.
So I would opt for, yes, you have a little shame.
For women, shame is, do it all, do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat.
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.
Shame is an epidemic in our culture.
If we're going to find our way back to each other, we have to understand and know empathy, because empathy's the antidote to shame.
If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence and judgment.
If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence and judgment.
Natural gas will do everything we want it to do.
It's 130 octane fuel.
It's 25 percent cleaner than oil.
It's ours, we have an abundance of it.
And it does not require a refinery.
It comes out of the ground at 130 octane.
Run it through the separator and you're ready to use it.
Natural gas will fit all of those.
And at the time I went into the wind business, natural gas was nine dollars.
CA: But natural gas is a fossil fuel.
What do you have to replace it?
TBP: Well I'm not ready to give up, but Jim and I talked there as he left, and I said, "How do you feel about natural gas?"
TBP: Solar and wind, Jim and I agreed on that in 13 seconds.
We have so much natural gas, a day will not come where you say, "Well let's don't use that anymore."
We have so much natural gas, a day will not come where you say, "Well let's don't use that anymore."
LAMTA have been on natural gas for 25 years.
Women are dying of heart disease, two, three, four times more than men.
And so the yellow is the fatty plaque, and panel A is a man.
Attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results, in all cases.
Writing is not actually as easy as that for me.
And I think you could boil this poem down to saying, "Some days you eat the bear, other days the bear eats you."
BC: There's a horror movie in there somewhere.
No wonder the Moon in the window seems to have drifted out of a love poem that you used to know by heart.
The poem that's coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of etiquette in country living that I had a very hard time, at first, processing.
I just have time to read a more recent poem to you.
If it has a subject, the subject is adolescence.
And it's addressed to a certain person.
Look, I had second thoughts, really, about whether I could talk about this to such a vital and alive audience as you guys.
You see, the battery is the key enabling device here.
You're looking at the cell house of a modern aluminum smelter.
Volta's battery works at room temperature.
We start here with our workhorse one watt-hour cell.
And then we've got a four kilowatt-hour cell on the horizon.
It's going to be 36 inches in diameter.
In a battery, I strive to maximize electrical potential; when mentoring, I strive to maximize human potential.
I feel a little uncomfortable.
I feel a little uncomfortable.
We are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it.
DARPA's hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built.
The third stage has a camera.
We call it rocketcam.
In fact, the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards.
This prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera.
It weighs less than one AA battery.
It does not eat nectar.
One square millimeter of a gecko's footpad has 14,000 hair-like structures called setae.
This green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life.
Now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments.
They were able to work together because they're connected by the Internet.
No, there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding in terms of really flying at that speed.
Now the purpose of the vehicle though, the purpose of the technology, is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes.
RD: Well I don't think we ultimately know what it will be, right.
But not only did they do that, they went to those who were running for seats to ask them, "What is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win?"
MT: This faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience.
I'm used to a stationary mic.
Now the Hepburn book was written in a very conversational style, it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you.
And I was particularly taken with this page of the book, and more specifically the lower right-hand corner.
And I was particularly taken with this page of the book, and more specifically the lower right-hand corner.
Hello!
What does that mean?
This is going to be the opposite of that.
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine.
I set up the type, I printed it out on an Epson printer with water-soluble ink, taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it. Presto!
And so here's the front and the spine, and it's flat.
A woman named Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom, she can't help but feel that, all of a sudden, she's entered a new reality that's just slightly different from the one that she left, but very similar, but different.
Fourteen weeks on the Best Seller list, eight printings, and still going strong.
That's 16 million square kilometers' worth of land.
Now, the irony is, it's probably sold in our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities.
The difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food, or maybe golf courses in Scottsdale, you take your pick.
But there's kind of a paradox here, because it looks like it's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here?
So without a doubt, agriculture is the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet since the end of the ice age. No question.
But what's really important here to remember is that it's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing.
In fact, we completely depend on it.
We already know climate change is a big problem.
Surprisingly, agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change.
We need collaboration, imagination, determination, because failure is not an option.
I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China.
And within a hundred years, that population of 24 had exploded to half a billion.
Everyone showed up.
Children at this Ukrainian orphanage are between the ages of six and 16.
But barring such an anomalous upbringing, it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours, most with fundamentally different features, that would rightly be called universes of their own.
But barring such an anomalous upbringing, it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours, most with fundamentally different features, that would rightly be called universes of their own.
Here's the surprise: They found that the expansion is not slowing down.
Instead they found that it's speeding up, going faster and faster.
Now if you saw an apple do that, you'd want to know why.
This number is small.
Well it surely is a technical detail, but some details really matter.
And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward.
But there's a cost to this elegant unification, because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn't quite work.
And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory.
It's called inflationary cosmology, which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space.
And if our universe got hit by another, that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect.
So the third commandment I want to leave here tonight is, a city of the future has to be socially integrated.
Fold.
"So Daddy could be gone." "Yes."
And she was fascinated by this, and she started to cry, and I started to cry, and her father started to cry, and now we're all crying. He didn't expect to come home from work to the Middle Passage, but there it goes.  And so, we made this game, and she got it.
She got it because she spent time with these people.
Like, here's the economics of illegal immigration.
And the more I learned about the Mexican culture -- my partner is Mexican — the more I learned that, you know, for all of us, food is a basic need, but, and it is obviously with Mexicans too, but it's much more than that.
I'll look away from the picture.
The Mall is a symbol of American democracy.
And what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing, it's not an image, it's not an artifact, actually it's a space, and it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side.
It's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power.
But beyond exhibiting contemporary art, the Hirshhorn will become a public forum, a place of discourse for issues around arts, culture, politics and policy.
It would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum.
It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference.
Where would it go?
There is no space there.
Well there's always the hole.
But how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it invisibly?
And the question is, if one inhabits that space, what is the material of the Mall?
It has to be different from the buildings there.
It has to be something entirely different.
It has to be air.
In our imagination, it has to be light.
It has to be ephemeral. It has to be formless.
So this is the big idea.
It's a giant airbag.
The membrane is translucent.
It's made of silcon-coated glass fiber.
So very efficient vehicles, buildings and factories save oil and coal, and also natural gas that can displace both of them.
But today's energy system is not just inefficient, it is also disconnected, aging, dirty and insecure.
So it needs refurbishment.
And whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security, or environmental stewardship and climate protection and public health, reinventing fire makes sense and makes money.
Seven years ago, an even faster and cheaper American manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part, which doubles as a carbon cap.
In one minute -- and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is.
In one minute -- and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is.
Don't worry about dropping it, it's tougher than titanium.
And Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016.
In America, our aging, dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050.
But with today's much better technologies, more mature delivery channels and integrative design, we can do far more and even cheaper.
And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure, this new fire is flameless.
Each of you owns a piece of that $5 trillion prize.
Do you see how there's three peaks to the yellow sine wave?
The Earth is neither flat nor round.
Do you think you're designing one thing, and then when it's produced it looks like something else?
RM: The "Double Raindrop" I worked on for nine months, and when I finally turned it on, I actually hated it.
As the parent of a nine-year-old girl, that number seems awfully low.
And increasingly, the price we're being asked to pay for all of this connectedness is our privacy.
This is happening today.
What we have is exactly the same thing, the same activity, but one of them makes you feel great and the other one, with just a small change of posture, makes you feel terrible.
The other dog doesn't have the button.
People who have an existing framework, an economic framework, an engineering framework, feel that actually logic is its own answer.
The Koreans, very assiduously, did test both.
The Koreans, very assiduously, did test both.
All of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or valeted.
Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids, his understanding of music was profound.
That was his passion for the music.
Both my parents really loved it.
They didn't know all that much about it, but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them.
And I think inspired by that memory, it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as I can, sort of pass it on through whatever means.
And in the 21st century ...
Now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord, even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room.
Now the impulse to notate, or, more exactly I should say, encode music has been with us for a very long time.
Now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded, saved, considered, prioritized, made into intricate designs.
Now this moment so fascinates me.
What happens when the music stops?
And to me that's the most essential of all.
And technology democratized music by making everything available.
Well, that's why I take every performance so seriously, why it matters to me so much.
We need your perspectives, your curiosity, your voices.
Oh, some of you have seen it.
When I moved to preparation, this same thing was true, expect that there were two schools.
KB: I love that shot.
In 2005, a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forests of Ecuador.

Renny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay.
We tried, with a tiny little piece of Limburger cheese, which smells badly after feet, to attract African malaria mosquitos.
And you know what? It worked.
In fact, it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that we're using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos than humans.
My second story is remarkable as well.
And last year we thought very, very hard, how can we resolve this problem? Until we realized that just like us, we have a unique smell, that mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell.
Ooh, that was very quick.
That means that out of five married couples, two will end up splitting their assets.
The optimism bias has been observed in many different countries -- in Western cultures, in non-Western cultures, in females and males, in kids, in the elderly.
It's quite widespread.
But individuals with severe depression, they have a pessimistic bias.
And that is the third reason why lowering your expectations will not make you happy.
What this means is that warning signs such as these may only have limited impact.
My friend who's getting married in a few weeks has done the same for his wedding budget.
So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language.
And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that.
And Brian's shoulders sank.
These people who had life-long fears of snakes were saying things like, "Look how beautiful that snake is."
And this is what he came up with.
And when the little girl came out of her scan, she ran up to her mother and said, "Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"
You really would be kind of out of luck.
And that's because if you take a brain out of the skull and you cut a thin slice of it, put it under even a very powerful microscope, there's nothing there.
It's gray, formless.
And it works in a very particular way.
Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue, it somehow only stains about one percent of them.
If everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible.
Now green fluorescent protein, which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish, is very useful.
And so coming back to the brain, this is from a genetically engineered mouse called "Brainbow."
So we went there with a truck. This is a photobooth truck.
So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease.
He came up with a name for his mystery agent.
Beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers -- people like that young girl from Beloit, Wisconsin.
Each time I street juggle I use improvisation.
Let's call it Island Networks.
Now this kingdom had many resources and mighty ambitions, but the one thing it lacked was people.
Now the kingdom is one of about 50 countries that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay of people living with HIV.
Now there are still many problems.
Like so I wrote a song, and I hope you guys dig it.
Not just any day, but it is a day.
And the important thing to remember is that this simulation is a good one.
So we started thinking: what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment?

So, well, we could persuade her to get into a train, and that's still a lot more efficient than a car, but that might be a lifestyle change, or there's the eco-car, top-left.
Now Codex C is actually buried in this book.
Because this book is actually a prayer book.
Now it should be clear by now that this book is in bad condition.
It got in worse condition in the 20th century after Heiberg saw it.
This book is the definition of a write-off.
It's the sort of book that you thought would be in an institution.
And so before we could start imaging Archimedes, we had to take this book apart.
And in the image on the right you might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing.
The Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another.
How were we going to do that?
The thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this.
And that is the future of the Web.
On paper the country was doing great.
It was also people's deep longing for freedom.
What really changed after the ouster of Mubarak wasn't that life got easier.
Actually he did, but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force, which doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence.
In other words, the rate of increase is exponential.
Nobody called. I was so nervous that I couldn't sit down. I just wandered around taking photos like this one, just for something to do.
Polls taken, this poll was taken 10 years ago.
Well, let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't solve the problem, but it can address the problem.
Ask the next 10 people you see on the streets, "Hey, do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions of Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson?"
I talked there, what, two weeks ago, something like that.
All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy.
If you take a close-up of those, they look like this.
So this star doesn't even appear until about two-thirds of the way into this story.
And soon thereafter there's enough material left over that you get a primordial soup, and that creates life.
Unless, of course, if you have a ski lift.
Unless, of course, if you have a ski lift.
You find muscular tubes, modified legs, modified fins, as well as the mammalian fleshy, inflatable cylinder that we're all familiar with -- or at least half of you are.
But then one day I started thinking about the mammalian penis.
And it's really an odd sort of structure.
Before it can be used for internal fertilization, its mechanical behavior has to change in a really dramatic fashion.
It's easy to bend.
But before it's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid, it has to become difficult to bend.
Without both elements you have no support.
So you can see that the fibers wrap in helices, and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves, which means the skeleton's flexible.
So something interesting had to be going on.
So something interesting had to be going on.
They're an integral part of the penile skeleton.
Later when this material was translated into a common European language, which is to say Latin, they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X.
But I'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of Design Within Reach catalogs, so I pretty much know everything there is.
This is known as the Theme Building; that is its name for reasons that are still very murky.
And it is perhaps the best example we have in Los Angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture.
It was first excavated in 1961 as they were building LAX, although scientists believe that it dates back to the year 2000 Before Common Era, when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants.
It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located, of course, at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design, the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously, the much better access to parking.
When it was uncovered, it ushered in a new era of streamlined, archaically futuristic design called Googie, which came to be synonymous with the Jet Age, a misnomer.
I do so many things on this little device.
More than that, I like to buy books on it that I never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and I never look at them again and it's perfect.
Unlike the Theme Building, this is not alien technology.
Unlike the Theme Building, this is not alien technology.
Or I should say, what it did was it took technology which, unlike people in this room, to many other people in the world, still feels very alien, and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate.
It's not that that window closes. It doesn't.
Well, this is my colleague Warren Jones, with whom we've been building these methods, these studies, for the past 12 years, and you see there a happy five-month-older, it's a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world, his mom, the caregiver, but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare.
Well, I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen only in our five-minute experiment.
We feel that individuals with autism, in fact, have a very special perspective on the world, and we need diversity, and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength: predictable situations, situations that can be defined.
You know, "Design -- bad design, there's just no excuse for it.
Every object should be about something, John.
He designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for Steelcase; that was important.
The song is just a given, that's how you have to think about it.
The song is just a given.
Think about it. Now, in design terms, a wheelchair is a very difficult object.
An object imbued with intent -- it has power, it's treasure, we're drawn to it.
But that doesn't change my belief that all of us, deep inside, here in this room and across this country, share a similar set of desires.
And the way I think about this is that healthcare is like any other system.
I believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country.
I believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare, it will not be by the diseases cured, but by the diseases prevented.
It will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists, but by how rarely we needed them.
As a filmmaker, it worried me.
The film that changed my life is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica, "Miracle in Milan."
In the last shot of "Miracle in Milan," slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms.
Sixty years after the film was made and 30 years after I first saw it, I see young faces tilt up in awe, their incredulity matching mine.
Frank Capra's classic values independence and propriety.
It shows how to do right, how to be heroically awkward.
Was there a hidden message?
We appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes, yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered.
And I didn't know where he was going with it at first.
You too might be gay! Because I know some gay people who are also single.
It's really scary, this gay lifestyle thing; it's super duper evil and there's no end to it!
The gay agenda, people!
Did you soak it all in? The gay agenda.
I wouldn't have been so confused; I wouldn't have been so upset.
I figured if I was a bit irreverent, you wouldn't find it serious.
In fact, when someone tells you they're a skater today, they pretty much mean a street skater, because freestyle, it took about five years for it to die, and at that stage, I'd been a "champion" champion for 11 years, which, phew!
Okay, so when you're skating, and you take a fall, the board slips that way or that way. It's kind of predictable.
It's a rotten neighborhood. Your first consideration is, am I gonna get beat up? You go out and -- See this wall?
But it is quite similar. I mean, what is it to hack, right?
But it is quite similar. I mean, what is it to hack, right?
And they're not all bad.
In fact, I've had so much success that I strangely always feel unworthy of.
In fact, I've had so much success that I strangely always feel unworthy of.
Because it's not just the mind.
You can think of a death penalty case as a story that has four chapters.
The first chapter of every case is exactly the same, and it is tragic.
When our son Lincoln was working on that math problem two weeks ago, it was a big, gnarly problem.
That's what we do for most problems -- in math, in physics, even in social policy -- we slice them into smaller, more manageable problems.
I want to tell you about the last conversation that I had with Will.
We're using energy we can harvest on our roofs, and also on the training pitches, which will be covered with large, flexible membranes, and we will see in the next years an industry coming up with flexible photovoltaics, giving the possibilities of shading against strong sun and producing electric energy in the same time.
I can dodge what I don't want and pull in what I want.
I can dodge what I don't want and pull in what I want.
Education is great.
I'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have.
The revolution is going to continue for at least several more decades.
When the subject is still very thinly populated, you can with diligence and hard work become the world authority.
It looks like I've paused the program.
Now you know why, and to me, that's the point of this program.
Now, the Western elites, however, have said this fear is misplaced.
Once you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation, the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.
It's not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work, and the most significant management innovation to come out of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model.
You just have to find another term and look that up.
The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end.
Years later, the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space, the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet.
So a few weeks ago, a friend of mine gave this toy car to his 8-year-old son.
And I like this phrase: "Scratch your own itch."
So, you know, I like this idea that hardware becomes like a piece of culture that you share and you build upon, like it was a song or a poem with Creative Commons.
information from the field, and you can get unbiased information.
They learned how to program and to make robots when they were probably, like, 11, and then they started to use Arduino to make these robots that play football. They became world champions by making an Arduino-based robot.
This doubles also as an iPod speaker.
I said, these kids are different.
Social media didn't create the revolution; it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore.
Now, this thing has a function.
He said, "Did you quit or were you fired?"
Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter, and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature.
So, this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking.
You won't be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet, in which the magnetic field is the same all around, the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet.
We have frictionless motion. It is still levitating, but can move freely all around.
And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail, it moves freely.
And I can even try a new thing; let's try it for the first time.
By the way, these travel at over 600 miles an hour.
We recently saw a case where some researchers made the H5N1 avian influenza virus more potent.
What happens if we were to take the President's DNA, or a king or queen's, and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that DNA and do penetration testing against it as a means of helping our leaders?
Or what if we sent it out to a few thousand?
More than 700 of these boats, which are fishermen boats repurposed with oil absorbent in white and oil containment in orange, were used, but they only collected three percent of the oil on the surface, and the health of the cleaners were very deeply affected.
Then I was so happy that I kept playing with the robot, and so you see the robot has a front rudder here.
But if we're going with the flow, if we pay attention to natural patterns instead of trying to be strong, but if you're going with the flow, we may absorb a lot of environmental noises, so the wave energy, to actually save some energy to move forward.
They made it, but they eventually published a simplified design.
We're working on also simpler technology, not that complex, with younger people and also older people, like this dinosaur is from Mexico.  So Protei is now an international network of innovation for selling technology using this shape-shifting hull.
And I started watching Kaki King a lot, and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence, so then I started watching his videos, and it's very surreal right now to be --   CA: Was that piece just now, that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?

The concussion didn't heal properly, and after 30 days, I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches, nausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog.
My brain started telling me, "Jane, you want to die."
But even with a game so simple, within just a couple days of starting to play, that fog of depression and anxiety went away.
And soon, I started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity, recruiting their own allies, and they were getting "super better," facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain, depression and Crohn's disease.
Even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS.
I mean, how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious, and in some cases life-and-death, circumstances?

But scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely.
We know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle.
And excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children, has been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors for obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety of problems that are probably due to disruption of the microbial community.
The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.

Thank you.  I also have with me a flame table.
It's very similar to a Rubens' tube, and it's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sound, such as eigenmodes, so let's fire it up and see what it does.
Actually, a lot of things are better with fire in my world, but the fire's just a foundation.
So if I show you another song off this album, and another, your eyes will easily pick out the use of repetition by the band Nirvana, and in the frequency distribution, the colors, you can see the clean-dirty-clean sound that they are famous for, and here is the entire album as a single visual impression, and I think this impression is pretty powerful.
Now, in this series he's speaking with the aid of a computer, which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences fairly easy. So I wrote a steering algorithm.
This is Stephen Hawking's universe.
Now, we've all seen a lot of TEDTalks online, so let's watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on.
There's no closed captioning for the TED theme song, and we're missing it, but if you've watched enough of these, you hear it in your mind's ear, and then applause starts.
One of the things that we've developed in the lab -- we've developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world's first autonomously drifting car.
It's another one of those categories where maybe there's not a lot of competition.
But this is P1. It's an entirely student-built electric vehicle, which through using its rear-wheel drive and front-wheel steer-by-wire can drift around corners.
But it turned out there was a technical twist to Carol's case.
Here's Ramon —  — looking for a little attention from Dad that week.
So what I did was, I filmed six of my friends and then, using video mapping and video projection, I created a video sculpture, which was these six friends projected into jars.  So now I have this collection of my friends I can take around with me whenever I go, and this is called Animalia Chordata, from the Latin nomenclature for human being, classification system.
You may never experience the entire thing yourself.
You're actually implicit in this work and you're erasing my life.
So, when your mom and dad met, there is a fertilized egg, that round thing with that little blip.
So how did his nose become his nose, his elbow his elbow, and why doesn't he get up one morning and have his nose turn into his foot?
You all remember, dolly, it came from a single mammary cell.
And again this didn't make sense to me.
Every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell, and they're part of the feather.
So, here is a lovely human breast.
So, we took the red cells -- you see the red cells are surrounded by blue, other cells that squeeze them, and behind it is material that people thought was mainly inert, and it was just having a structure to keep the shape, and so we first photographed it with the electron microscope years and years ago, and you see this cell is actually quite pretty.
I made a radical hypothesis.
You need to always think, what else needs to be discovered?
You put the cancer cells there, and they do go all over, they do this. They don't do this.
But here is a poem from Yeats. I'll just read you the last two lines.
They need our help. They need the cavalry, and the cavalry's not going to come from Mars.
In 2003, I started a project with computer scientist Adam Montandon, and the result, with further collaborations with Peter Kese from Slovenia and Matias Lizana from Barcelona, is this electronic eye.
It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device.
Now I dress in a way that it sounds good.   So today I'm dressed in C major, so it's quite a happy chord.  If I had to go to a funeral, though, I would dress in B minor, which would be turquoise, purple and orange.  Also, food, the way I look at food has changed, because now I can display the food on a plate, so I can eat my favorite song.
It's not my fault, because —  And so another thing that happens is that I started having this secondary effect that normal sounds started to become color.
Piracy is also very active in the Strait of Malacca.
When you can read and write in Afghanistan, you will typically put a pen in your pocket.
This is a US Navy warship.
I would argue life is a rheostat.
Why? Because it makes a lot of sense: In order to solve these puzzles effectively, if you think about it, your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously, right?
It needs to be alert, for which caffeine is very good.
Volatile stock market, getting negative feedback, it is also immediate.

So let me start with this.
And what's great about this is the technology's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does.

MM: I should leap in.
We're all very, very familiar with the Internet.
It's not something that's institutionalized.
Often the roofs are broken, so you don't have enough darkness in the classroom to do these things.
It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all.

BG: Great. Good news.  VV: So ...  if the pointer, unfortunately, had pointed to the red spot, we would have to rush you to a hospital.
So we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the ASHA worker.

The first computer was really designed in the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s.
It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal.
It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more.
You need accessories you're going to come with.
Because of course, there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy, so, you know, that'll be fine.  Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training, and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother, and Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine.
He was building a machine to do mathematics, and Lovelace said, "You could do more than mathematics on this machine." And just as you do, everyone in this room already's got a computer on them right now, because they've got a phone.
If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom.
Whether it's video or text or music or voice, it's all numbers, it's all, underlying it, mathematical functions happening, and Lovelace said, "Just because you're doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn't mean these things can't represent other things in the real world, such as music."
It doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical, like Babbage's was, or electronic, like computers are today, or perhaps in the future, cells, or, again, mechanical again, once we get into nanotechnology.
And so suddenly, you get this link where you say this thing Babbage had built really was a computer.
In fact, it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers, only really slowly.  To give you an idea of how slowly, it had about 1k of memory.
It used punch cards, which were being fed in, and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.
Over in Swindon, the Science Museum archives, there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine.
That's been done. The second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build.
When it's built, you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works, because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you, you've got to look at this humongous thing and say, "Ah, I see the memory operating, I see the CPU operating, I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating."  But in between that we're going to do a simulation.
Babbage himself wrote, he said, as soon as the analytical engine exists, it will surely guide the future course of science.

Through this very simple process, we can create an astounding variety of forms.
It took me several months to design the column, but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces.
This is the most glorious painting.
This is the most glorious painting.
I first saw it when I was 19, and I immediately went out and got a poster of it, and in fact I still have that poster. 30 years later it's hanging in my house.
He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience, and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.
And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.
And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.
Again and again, back to the painting, looking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.
The last painting I'm going to talk about is called "Anonymous" by anonymous.  This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.
Now, in the National Portrait Gallery, if you don't know the biography of the painting, it's kind of useless to you.
Now, here's the story.
Try to spot the beehive. It's there.
Try to understand that bees are very important.
So, if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones, you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom.
But also, it gave the Chinese a national public sphere for people to, it's like a training of their citizenship, preparing for future democracy.
really kind of fascinating.
And the very next shot, right after this -- So you can see what I was doing.
Gloria Stuart: That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.
It's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence of vision that creates a motion picture, and one of the things I had to do is, we — Sasha Baron Cohen is a very clever, very smart guy, comedian, wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of the Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things, and he wanted his leg brace to get caught on a moving train.
It's going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation.
No, well, I don't know, it's very familiar to me.
In fact, I think it's not better than it. The thing is --  -- it's more interesting to me. It's less boring for me.
I'm really leaning into me, because I, because I have to think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly as that Beethoven text is running in time through my head and I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations I'm going to make to it.
So this is an engaging enterprise for me, and I've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there, and now my face appears twice, so I think we can agree that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise.  But it's an engaging one, and it's interesting to me for a while, but then I get bored with it, and by it, I actually mean, the piano, because it becomes, it's this familiar instrument, it's timbral range is actually
Another adaptation would be this piece.
You're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments in this clip.   This, in fact, is not the title of this piece.
And the score for the piece looks like this, and it instructs me, the performer, to make various hand gestures at very specific times synchronized with an audio tape, and that audio tape is made up exclusively of vocal samples.
This is my harvest, people.
I don't care if you're on the left, on the right, up the middle, wherever.
She was a mother who gave her life trying to get her son a chance at a better life.
But it's not just about the numbers, it's also about the people.
Of course, we all know as educators that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.
So this personalization is something that one can then build by having the virtue of large numbers.
And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on.
Openness isn't the end.
Dominic Behan: ♫ Come all ye young rebels, ♫ ♫ and list while I sing, ♫ ♫ for the love of one's land is a terrible thing. ♫ BD: ♫ Oh my name it is nothin', ♫ ♫ my age it means less, ♫ ♫ the country I come from is called the Midwest. ♫ KF: Okay, so in this case, Dylan admits he must have heard "The Patriot Game," he forgot about it,
And that's, that's what Guthrie did right here, and I'm sure you all recognize the results.
I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work.
Steve Jobs: And we have invented a new technology called multi-touch.
The soil is extremely good.  We've even invented a new form of tourism.
And here's the thing as well.
What will I stand up for?
But she told the students to sit down.
I have a little mantra.
My fear grows fat on the energy I feed it.
The fear is the child.
The fear is the child.
Wherever there is injustice there's anger.
The story starts: I was at a friend's house, and she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual, which is the manual of mental disorders.
It lists every known mental disorder.
And it used to be, back in the '50s, a very slim pamphlet.
Anyway, I was looking through this book, wondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was, or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder if you're not a trained professional, or maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire to label what's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder.
I didn't know which of these was true, but I thought it was kind of interesting, and I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view, which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists.
He said, "Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions?"
CO: So it's working, but it could be better.
So that's what we're working on.
They needed openness. They needed to create a norm which said, when you do an experiment, you have to publish not just your claims, but how you did the experiment.
They had to quickly synchronize what other natural philosophers knew. Otherwise, you couldn't get the right kind of argument going.
The scientific revolution wasn't created by the printing press.
Now, for decades there has been a canonical solution to this problem, which is to use something called a "version control system," and a version control system does what is says on the tin.
It provides a canonical copy of the software on a server somewhere.
And then, 15 years after looking at Linux and figuring out how the community worked, he said, "I think I know how to write a version control system for free people."
And he called it "Git." Git is distributed version control.
Somebody put up a tool during the copyright debate last year in the Senate, saying, "It's strange that Hollywood has more access to Canadian legislators than Canadian citizens do. Why don't we use GitHub to show them what a citizen-developed bill might look like?"
This is a called a "diff," this thing on the right here.
And this is not the audience to which I'm going to preach to what extent the Internet empowered people.
So in the world of product design, the beautiful baby's like the concept car.
It's the knockout.
We want design to get out for people to see it.
So it turns out that design for inspiration doesn't really ...
OK, that was an important lesson.
Jaundice affects two-thirds of newborns around the world.
There is another cure.
It sounds crazy, it sounds dumb, but there are actually hospitals who would rather have no equipment than something that looks cheap and crummy.
When we think about actual use, you'll notice that Firefly has a single bassinet.
If you try to put more than one kid in, you're stacking them on top of each other.
I think of this as the place of imagination, of potential, but what are its qualities?
It is objectless. There are no things in it.
It is dimensionless. It is limitless.
Human time, industrial time, tested against the time of the tides, in which these memories of a particular body, that could be any body, multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction, many times, placed over three square miles, a mile out to sea, disappearing, in different conditions of day and night.
As you walk towards the ever-open threshold, you disappear, both to yourselves and to others.
Sydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney.
What 'The Sultan's Elephant' represents is no less than an artistic occupation of the city and a reclamation of the streets for the people."
On the train home, she gave me a present: a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.
And I thought she'd say, "Oh, you know, up the lagoon somewhere, or maybe across Africa," but you'll be happy to know she said it came from here, it comes from the North Sea.
And where's the airtime sold?
And third is, and I'm taking this from the great American beat poet Allen Ginsberg, that alternate economies barter and different kinds of currency, alternate currencies are also very important, and he talked about buying what he needed just with his good looks.
We've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's vision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years.
It's a sexy vision, for sure. Many have embraced it.
Well, in part, because health care in the developed world, the health care costs in the [developed] world, are rapidly spiraling out of control, and a huge chunk of those costs are human resource costs.
But equally important is because health care has become so incredibly professionalized that it's become very remote and removed from local communities.
For me, what's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting, though, isn't that it simply makes health care more accessible and affordable but that it is also fundamentally empowering.
Later, in the 1850s, under President Pierce, he was known to have remarked — probably the only thing he's known for — when a neighbor passed by and said, "I'd love to see the beautiful house," and Pierce said to him, "Why my dear sir, of course you may come in.
So let me close by saying that I think the important thing for us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution.
Life was very small for most people.
My PhD student Ryan Chin presented these early ideas two years ago at a TEDx conference.

You have nobody to make eye contact with.
It's an electronic bike.
A father came out of his house to tell his teenage son and his five friends that it was time for them to stop horsing around on the front lawn and on the sidewalk, to get home, finish their schoolwork, and prepare themselves for bed.
We had a car that came by, same identical car as described by the teenagers, right?
I said, "Your honor," and I don't know whether I was emboldened by the scientific measurements that I had in my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate, or whether it was just sheer stupidity, which is what the defense lawyers thought —  — when they heard me say, "Yes, Your Honor, I want you stand right there and I want the car to go around the block again
and I want it to come and I want it to stop right in front of you, three to four feet away, and I want the passenger to extend his hand with a black object and point it right at you, and you can look at it as long as you want."
And that's what I want to focus on.
So a few months later, in 2008, one of our scientists built on that research. He took skin biopsies, this time from people who had a disease, ALS, or as you call it in the U.K., motor neuron disease. He turned them into the IPS cells that I've just told you about, and then he turned those IPS cells into the motor neurons that actually were dying in the disease.
But what you can do with human stem cells, now, is actually create avatars, and you can create the cells, whether it's the live motor neurons or the beating cardiac cells or liver cells or other kinds of cells, and you can test for drugs, promising compounds, on the actual cells that you're trying to affect, and this is now, and it's absolutely extraordinary, and you're going to know at the beginning,
But it isn't really enough just to look at the cells from a few people or a small group of people, because we have to step back. We've got to look at the big picture.
on brain cells and heart cells and liver cells.
And we also use functional MRI, called fMRI, to take a video, a movie, of brain activity when participants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or perceiving something.
Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.
It's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species, and it's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions, things like decision-making, planning, planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year, inhibiting inappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid.
But it's when you compare the last two groups, the mid-adolescent group and the adult group where things get really interesting, because there, there is no continued improvement in the no-director condition.
But now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system, so I'm going to show you the limbic system in red in the slide behind me, and also on this brain.
So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain, and it's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things, including taking risks.
All that changed was the acoustics of the classroom in those two examples.
Unfortunately, empirical data, good, hard stats, don't exist, and therefore to prove my point, I first of all had to find some proxy way of uncovering how much food was being wasted.
This man, in Kashgar, Xinjiang province, in Western China, is serving up his national dish.
It's called sheep's organs.
If we did that, and fed it to pigs, we would save that amount of carbon.
They kind of have this vault where they're stored in high-def, and George Lucas did all the sound effects.  So sometimes, remembering them, it's like, it's not like any other kind of memories.
The mobile phone has given people around the world an important tool towards gaining their political freedom.
It has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet.
It is time to be asking questions about technology.
Where does it come from?
Well, working with the safe organisms that we normally work with, the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating, like, some sort of superbug, that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the Sahara Desert.
The thing is, there's something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can't find anywhere else.
There's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project, and you don't have to justify to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money, that it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible.
Even the BBC and The New York Times.
Even the BBC and The New York Times.
For example, Nalini Ambady, a researcher at Tufts University, shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions, their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued.
So we bring people into a lab, and they do either high- or low-power poses again, they go through a very stressful job interview.
Because we rate them on all these variables related to competence, like, how well-structured is the speech?
For example, take Dan Rounds, who is a music and math major from East Lansing, Michigan.
And with that in mind, I'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading.
Now, I don't know how many people here are familiar with the term "mensch."
And the floppy disk drive person wears it.  She finds the first sector on the disk, and takes data off the disk and passes it off to, of course, the bus.
And then I spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this, and I stopped doing it because my students at MIT got so much better than myself, so I had to hang up my mouse.
But in '96, I made my last piece. It was in black and white, monochrome, fully monochrome, all in integer mathematics.
You know, when people say, "I don't get art.
I don't get it at all." That means art is working, you know?
At RISD, we have this amazing facility called the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has 80,000 samples of animal, bone, mineral, plants.
And why do we have this facility?
And I often say, well, there's something good to how things used to be done. There's something very different about it, something we should figure out what is good about how we did it, even in this new era.
So they'd go to an antique shop, and they'd look at this cup, and they'd say, "Tell us about this cup."
As an example of authoritarianism, I was in Russia one time traveling in St. Petersburg, at a national monument, and I saw this sign that says, "Do Not Walk On The Grass," and I thought, oh, I mean, I speak English, and you're trying to single me out. That's not fair.
And what is that, structurally?
There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me and Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation.
Reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me.
You have to send signals to manage your image in their mind.
Here's the cool thing. Six or seven years ago, we developed a team. It was at the time in Houston, Texas.
The decade that we've just been through had relatively anemic job growth all throughout, especially when we compare it to other decades, and the 2000s are the only time we have on record where there were fewer people working at the end of the decade than at the beginning. This is not what you want to see.
This is an accurate assessment of what's going on.
People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies, and the occasions when it works they will publish, and the ones where it doesn't work they won't.
Now actually, in 1993, the researchers who did that 1980 study, that early study, published a mea culpa, an apology to the scientific community, in which they said, "When we carried out our study in 1980, we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance."
There are academic journals like "Trials," the open access journal, which will publish any trial conducted in humans regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result.
I've always written primarily about architecture, about buildings, and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions.
And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire, and he said, "There's your problem.
A squirrel is chewing on your Internet."  And this seemed astounding. The Internet is a transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions.
Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben, because that's where you get the best reception, but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it for the afternoon to use in an office presentation.
And I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for.
But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive, as expansive as you can imagine.
Now there are six cables and more coming, three down each coast.
leveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.
Then you can see the English engineers looking on.
And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw, you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud.
Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug, one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard, and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy, which has become very popular in music therapy now.
On the other hand, I had played the violin my entire life.
Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession.
And after two more years of studying music, I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta.  And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic.
But he was a passionate teacher, and I remember one of our earlier classes with him, he was projecting images on the wall, asking us to think about them, and he put up an image of a painting.
A few years later, I was invited to be the director of the museum, and after I got over that -- "Who, me? The tapestry geek? I don't wear a tie!" -- I realized the fact: I believe passionately in that curated museum experience.
It could have been a train wreck.
and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm a huge advocate of the Web.
It's reality. As a young engineering student, I remember going to a demonstration where they basically, the demonstrator did something quite intriguing.
I mean, this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me?
So guess what happens? A thin green line comes out as it flows down the pipe. It's not that interesting.
He adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens.
They're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink so that it actually gets diluted out, and the color's gone.
And while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it, all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online.
And while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it, all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online.
Popcorn changes all of that.
Let's set it to something else.
The map is relatively small in overall size, so something that you could still hold as a fold-out map or display in a reasonably-sized display box on a bus shelter.
Oh, and that's not even the tip of the iceberg.
Here we go.  This little baby has a lot of horsepower.
It's sort of the good old, traditional form of terrorism, but it's sort of been packaged for the 21st century.
For my part, what I wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand, say, Coca-Cola.
For my part, what I wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand, say, Coca-Cola.
Both are fairly bad for your health.  If you look at it as a brand in those ways, what you'll come to realize is, it's a pretty flawed product.
As we've said, it's pretty bad for your health, it's bad for those who it affects, and it's not actually good if you're a suicide bomber either.
And you're not really going to, in the '80s, end capitalism by supporting one of these groups. It's a load of nonsense.
The brand has an Achilles' heel.
Our target audience, it's not just the producers of terrorism, as I've said, the terrorists.
So we've got to find a different mechanism, and one of the best mechanisms I've ever come across is the victims of terrorism.
They are somebody who can actually stand there and say, "This product's crap. I had it and I was sick for days.
So how can we ever do anything new? Well fortunately, evolution has given us an answer, right?
It's play.
Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle. The interesting question is, which?
What was really exciting about this project was we, and Beau, had no idea whether it would work.
What was really exciting about this project was we, and Beau, had no idea whether it would work.
It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing, because that's what we do in the lab, but for a teacher not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day -- so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick, who was the collaborator on this project. Okay?
That's a science paper, basically.  So the kids give me the words, right? I put it into a narrative, which means that this paper is written in kidspeak.

The first author is Blackawton Primary School, because if it were ever referenced, it would be "Blackawton et al," and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal, and it says this. It said many things, but it said this.

Right? We normally walk through life responding, but if we ever want to do anything different, we have to step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes, he was able to see the world in a new way.
So, Amy?
For example, the "Lady with the Unicorn," another painting by Rafael, well, you see the unicorn.
And the leading point of view on this, whether measured by number of books sold, mentions in media, or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization, is this view that national borders really don't matter very much anymore, cross-border integration is close to complete, and we live in one world.
Once upon a time, the world was a big, dysfunctional family.
And I've got to tell you, I wasn't that hopeful, because I'd seen the establishment. I thought, it always sticks together. I am out of luck.
So, thank you.  Well, I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain.
Slightly embarrassing admission: Even when I was a kid, I used to have these little spy books, and I would, like, see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down.
It's open-source, with documentation, and it allows you to make a Freedom of Information request, to ask your public body a question, so it takes all the hassle out of it, and I can tell you that there is a lot of hassle making these requests, so it takes all of that hassle out, and you just type in your question, for example, how many police officers have a criminal record?
I think we've all read the Grimms' fairy tales, which are, indeed, very grim.
But the world isn't a fairy tale, and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge.
But the world isn't a fairy tale, and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge.
not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous minor monarchy, democracy is a thing of value for which we should be fighting. But in order to do so we need to get away from instrumental arguments.
Why should we get away from those arguments?
The point about democracy is not instrumental.
The point about democracy is not instrumental.
It's not about the things that it brings.
The point about democracy is not that it delivers legitimate, effective, prosperous rule of law.
The point about democracy is intrinsic.
Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity, the dignity of the individual, the idea that each individual should have an equal vote, an equal say, in the formation of their government.
Democracy is not simply a question of structures.
All of these great fictional characters, all of them who were hurt by their condition, all of them who spawned thousands of other books and other films, all of them were fostered, adopted or orphaned.
On the third children's home, at 15, I started to rebel, and what I did was, I got three tins of paint, Airfix paint that you use for models, and I was -- it was a big children's home, big Victorian children's home -- and I was in a little turret at the top of it, and I poured them, red, yellow and green, the colors of Africa, down the tiles.
I have to tell this story.
In the 17th century, a woman named Giulia Tofana had a very successful perfume business.
Just like fear offers us protective benefits, disgust seems to do the same thing, except for what disgust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us, or heights, but rather things that might poison us, or give us disease and make us sick.
Just like fear offers us protective benefits, disgust seems to do the same thing, except for what disgust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us, or heights, but rather things that might poison us, or give us disease and make us sick.
So here are a couple of examples.
That's the first line of defense for the body.
I presently, or currently, work with smart materials, and a smart thermo-bimetal.
I presently, or currently, work with smart materials, and a smart thermo-bimetal.
First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy, and that's a very big deal for architecture.
You can see that here by the different reflection on this side.
And because it has two different coefficients of expansion, when heated, one side will expand faster than the other and result in a curling action.
And what it basically implies is that, in houses now, we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things, as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building.
And so you see here some early studies of blocks, where those holes are actually coming through, and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied, and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little hard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows.
At 8, their nappies must be changed, so a staff member may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children.
All we need is a playing card. Any card will do.
All right. Very significant mark.
There's spring, summer, autumn and â Voice: My favorite season is winter.MT: Well yeah, mine too.
So let's start off looking at something rather not-so-small, something that we can see with our naked eye, and that's a bee. So when you look at this bee, it's about this size here, it's about a centimeter.
A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see.
So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system, they're actually moving all over the place.
This cell is looking for foreign objects, bacteria, things that it can find.
And it's looking around, and when it finds something, and recognizes it being foreign, it will actually engulf it and eat it.
And it's looking around, and when it finds something, and recognizes it being foreign, it will actually engulf it and eat it.
So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower, what would that flower look like, if the flower was this big?
The petal of that flower looks like that, so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects, and if you look a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here, this is the style of that flower, and you notice that it's got these little -- these are like little jelly-like things that are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs.
So this little ant that's crawling here, it's like it's in a little Willy Wonka land.
This is from Lahaina, and when we're walking along a beach, we're actually walking along millions of years of biological and geological history.
Now something's interesting here. This looks very different than any sand on Earth that I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of sand on Earth, believe me.  Look at this hole in the middle. That hole was caused by a micrometeorite hitting the Moon.
Now here's a grain of sand that is from the Moon, and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there.
For a hundred years, despite evidence to show that this is what they were doing, we didn't believe it.
And so therefore, if you look at the same region of a genome in many mammals that have been evolutionarily distant from each other and are also ecologically divergent, you will get a better understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is, i.e., if it is important for the mammal to function, for its survival, it will be the same in all of those different lineages, species, taxa.
Well, really, this is a picture drawn from the 1500s of the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered one of the most familiar, yet the least well-understood, aspects of all of biology, and really, since the dawn of civilization, mankind has sought to avoid it.
Every day -- this morning, I wake up and go, my life is about a mustache.  Essentially, I'm a mustache farmer.  And my season is November.   So in 2005, the campaign got more momentum, was more successful in Australia and then New Zealand, and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point.
And he looked at me and laughed and said, "Adam, sounds like a really novel idea, but we're an ultraconservative organization."  I've heard this before. I know how it goes.
So in 2007, we brought the campaign across here, and it was, it set the stage for the campaign.
We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people.
Along the y-axis, the vertical axis, is how tall they actually were.
Well, to do that, one thing is we can look at the deception-detection literature.
It's a very old literature by now, it's coming up on 50 years.
The first is, we're really bad at detecting deception, really bad. Fifty-four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not.
I can look at lies that before were said and then gone.
Now, you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task.
Well, let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas, I believe, is that we're leaving these huge traces behind.
you grab the pot, and in Japan, this red-hot pot would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea, and you can imagine what that steam would smell like.
I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements.
I had to let go at the very beginning, and I had to immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists and writers and musicians and filmmakers, and as I listened to these stories, I realized that creativity grows out of everyday experiences more often than you might think, including letting go.
You can see the sort of break in the everyday.
While he was there, he traveled to Madrid, where he went to the Prado to see this picture by the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez.
He's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand and his palette in the other.
Time is unstoppable, and it transforms the event.
But as you can also see, this one did break at some point in its hundred years.
But the person who put it back together, instead of hiding the cracks, decided to emphasize them, using gold lacquer to repair it.
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife?
And this ideal product would also be able to go about five kilometers a day so you could get to your job, get to school, and do it on many, many different types of terrain.
But when you get home or want to go indoors at your work, it's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside.
And as they slide their hand down the lever, they can push with a smaller effective lever length, but push through a bigger angle every stroke, which makes a faster rotational speed, and gives you an effective high gear.
And as they slide their hand down the lever, they can push with a smaller effective lever length, but push through a bigger angle every stroke, which makes a faster rotational speed, and gives you an effective high gear.
The first is that this product works well because we were effectively able to combine rigorous engineering science and analysis with user-centered design focused on the social and usage and economic factors important to wheelchair users in the developing countries.
to analyze how fast you should be able to go in this chair as you put your arms up and down the levers.
So because we tested it with wheelchair users, with wheelchair manufacturers, we got that feedback from them, not just articulating their problems, but articulating their solutions, and worked together to go back to the drawing board and make a new design, which we brought back to East Africa in '09 that worked a lot better than a normal wheelchair on rough terrain, but it still didn't work well indoors because it was too big,
Most of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old, not eight years old, and in fact, if we look at the projected demographics of video game play, the video game players of tomorrow are older adults.  So video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society.
Guess what? Their vision is really, really good.
It's better than those that don't play.
They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.
Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it in the context of another group of technology users, a group which is actually much revered by society, which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.
That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain.
Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?
"Come on. This is our opportunity."
They said to my parents, the neck break was a stable fracture, but the back was completely crushed.
And I can remember Mom sitting on the end of my bed, and saying, "I wonder if life will ever be good again."
I now know that my real strength never came from my body, and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically, who I am is unchanged.
In that original idea, the concept of jihad is as important to Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians.

He told me that, of bin Laden's many crimes, this was, in his mind, one that didn't get enough attention, that he took this word, this beautiful idea.

There's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.
The hunger and thirst was, and still remains: How do I get people who hate poetry to love me?
Boards don't hit back.
You go from drug formulation, lab testing, animal testing, and then clinical trials, which you might call human testing, before the drugs get to market.
It costs a lot of money, a lot of time, and sometimes, even when a drug hits the market, it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people.
And so thinking about the models that we've just discussed, you can see, going forward, that tissue engineering is actually poised to help revolutionize drug screening at every single step of the path: disease models making for better drug formulations, massively parallel human tissue models helping to revolutionize lab testing, reduce animal testing and human testing in clinical trials, and individualized therapies that disrupt what we even consider to be a market at all.
The company, Gilead, that holds the patents, has licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool.
This is poo, and what I want to do today is share my passion for poo with you, which might be quite difficult, but I think what you might find more fascinating is the way these small animals deal with poo.
So this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice, and yet it can do things that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing.
So the question is, how do they deal with this material?
And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort.
So what you've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the African veld.
Its head is down. It's walking backwards.
So watch this beetle, and there's two things that I would like you to be aware of.
A little dance, and then heads off in a particular direction.
So this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet. It's turned by 90 degrees.
And look at what the beetle does.
The sun is a very important cue in the sky for them.
What we do is we get a great big polarization filter, pop the beetle underneath it, and the filter is at right angles to the polarization pattern of the sky.
How far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves?
The beetle itself and the ball are probably around about 30 to 35 degrees centigrade, so this is a great big ball of ice cream that this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld.
And look at its front legs. They're roaringly hot.
However, there's one more story I'd like to share with you, and that's this particular species.
This is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior.
So what we're looking at here is a behavior called path integration.
And what's taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot, it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food, and then when it finds food, it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is.
Now there's two ways it could be doing that, and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it's at the foraging site.
If it's using landmarks, it will find its home.
If it is using something called path integration, it will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot, and what it's doing here if it's using path integration is it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction.
It hasn't a clue.
It starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food, but it is clearly completely lost.
"They know."  And of course, it's growing so fast, sometimes there's growing pains.
To give an example of how we rely on the audience, on the 5th of September in Costa Rica, an earthquake hit.
It was a 7.6 magnitude. It was fairly big.
And 60 seconds is the amount of time it took for it to travel 250 kilometers to Managua.
They were well respected. They were known.
So if you look in the video, there's the big umbrella, there's a white lilo in the pool, there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool, and there's two trees in the background.
Little bit of trickery. And there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool.
Little bit of trickery. And there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool.
Syria has been really interesting for us, because obviously a lot of the time you're trying to debunk stuff that can be potentially war crime evidence, so this is where YouTube actually becomes the most important repository of information about what's going on in the world.
The allegations were that these guys were Muslim Brotherhood and they were throwing Syrian Army officers' bodies off the bridge, and they were cursing and using blasphemous language, and there were lots of counterclaims about who they were, and whether or not they were what the video said it was.
We looked at the curbs. The curbs were throwing shadows south, so we could tell the bridge was running east-west across the river.
So we go a bit further. We switch to the satellite view, and we find another bridge, and everything starts to line up.
Truth is never binary. Truth is a value.
We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food. So it is no use.
No one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped at the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica.
The incorporated side, the company, is doing things that it does really well.
The incorporated side, the company, is doing things that it does really well.
Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they're selling it in a marketplace.
And I can tell you two great stories.
What happens in Peer, Inc. companies is that you have tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions of people who are creating experiments on this model, and so out of all that influence and that effort, you are having this exceptional amount of innovation that is coming out.
But there are all these other areas that are these profound, big problems that I know that we can work on, and people are working on them in many different sectors, but there's this really fabulous group of things with the power of this Peers, Inc. model.
Now there's just one problem with this line of reasoning, and that's that the insula does a lot.
And we took these messages and we made posters out of it, because I know people: They don't read, they see images.
So to me, this is the courageous thing to do, to try to reach the other side before it's too late, because when it's going to be too late, it's going to be too late.
Just raise that. Exactly.
And it made me think. I love studying these moments in American history when there was this frenzy of partisan anger, that the economy was on the verge of total collapse.
And nothing happened at all.
Now imaginative people have been having fun with this for over 400 years.
Giambattista della Porta, a Neapolitan scholar in the 16th century, examined and studied the natural world and saw how it could be manipulated.
And that's the nickname given to this disease.
But it's not one virus, it's four, and the same protection that gives you the antibodies and protects you from the same virus that you had before actually makes you much more susceptible to the other three.
This is really unpleasant stuff, and if it was any good, we wouldn't have this massive increase in mosquitos and we wouldn't have this massive increase in dengue fever.
Clearly the product you've got has got to be safe to humans.
We are going to use it in and around humans.
Both have a side benefit, which is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously.
Now that process feels great. It feels really satisfying.
It's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too.

For me, the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation.
The kid had no patience for him.
Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results.
Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal.
But if you give people vitamin D supplements, you don't change that high rate of heart disease.
So what I'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town.
And they were the first people to describe this new chemical transmitter, nitric oxide.
What nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels, so it lowers your blood pressure.
And I started doing research, and we found, very excitingly, that the skin produces nitric oxide.
So it's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises.
It arises in the skin.
How do you have low blood pressure in your skin?
It seemed we couldn't turn off the production of nitric oxide in the skin of humans.
This is separate from vitamin D.
Now, one of the problems with looking at blood pressure is your body does everything it can to keep your blood pressure at the same place.
In the arm, you can measure blood flow in the arm by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it.
So you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that.
In winter or summer, it's the same amount of light.
So what do we think?
We're still working at this story, we're still developing it, we're still expanding it.
We suspect a lot of these come from diet, green leafy vegetables, beetroot, lettuce has a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin.
They draw with crayons on the wall.
Then a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense."
Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything?
Yes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis."
In that moment, art makes you happy because it's not work.
The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.
It's a bit mischievous, actually.
"Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired."
Or so I wished.
So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.
Art is the ultimate goal.
It saves our souls and makes us live happily.
And then she clarified. She said, "You know what, I don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it.
Here's what had to happen.
The next thing is, that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA.
The workers still come the next day, they do their job, but they're following different instructions.
And then we have, of course, as any good scientist has to have, explosions!
Let's take Britain as an example.
Our government didn't design the national lottery, it didn't fund the national lottery, it doesn't operate the national lottery.
This act defines what a national lottery will look like.
It specifies certain benefits that the state can uniquely bestow on the operators.
So imagine that policymakers outlined a facility.
Think of it as a regulated public utility.
And it's a series of markets for low-level trade that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company.
So in Scratch, to code, you just snap blocks together.
Here's an example.
So it's a little bit like Microsoft Kinect, where you interact with gestures in the world.
So I showed this to the clubhouse member -- let's call him Victor -- and Victor, when he saw that this block would let him increment the score, he knew exactly what to do.
1939, that's when they discovered oil.
What did it do?
Say a new super bug has emerged.
I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends, and I found myself never having time for all the projects that I wanted to work on on my own.
I think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this.
We asked people, "Do you want this action, and to have buildings painted like that?"
And then the second question was, "Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue?"
To the first question, 63 percent of people said yes, we like it.
Thirty-seven said no, we don't like it.
The freedom that was won in 1990 brought about a state of anarchy in the city, while the barbarism of the '90s brought about a loss of hope for the city.
We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets.
We spent a lot less on education, about 35 percent less on education.
In a nutshell, you can think of physics as follows.
So you take a chunk of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics.
The study we published last year called "The Network of Global Corporate Control" was the first extensive analysis of economic networks.
This is the TNC network which we analyzed.
It's not a street map."
I really hope that this complexity perspective allows for some common ground to be found.
This is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire.
It's pretty much like the moon. It has intermittent eclipses.
But what they know is they know how to resurrect it.
What I'm going to show you, though, is something that I've been engaging in for a year, which is trying to gather all of the largest datasets that we have access to as economists, and I'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences, hoping to get this relationship to break.
And as a good primate, she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer.
It's a whole week long of excitement.
It's something that so many girls -- I'm lucky, I never died -- but many die.
The fly is going to sense this predator.
The engine of the fly is absolutely fascinating.
They have two types of flight muscle: so-called power muscle, which is stretch-activated, which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled on a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system.
So I want you to look at the payload at the tail of the fruit fly.
How small can neurons get? Well, look at this interesting insect.
And here's an endoscopic movie of this structure.
You can measure the aerodynamic forces it's creating.
But this is just one of many neuromodulators that's in the fly's brain.
And these meetings had this effect while taking under 20 minutes.
Nothing takes longer than two weeks.
If the stick were ever found, all humankind would be happy.
Tolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.
He still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass.
Greatness is not a matter of circumstance.
I tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools, where did it come from?
And you can look far back into the past, but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is, it's quite easy to figure out where it came from.
They created a global computer made up of people.
It's still with us today.
It's quite fashionable to say that the education system's broken.
It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.
It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.
The children came running in.
I'll go back to the lab and say, we need teachers.
It's not about making learning happen.
And if he says, "Well, what? how?"
And if he says, "Well, what? how?"
So here are a couple of images from SOLEs.
Help me build this school.
And he said, "3,000 of the 8,000 people in Greenville."
Number two, very quickly: How do you solve global climate change when we don't even have a national energy policy in this country and when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm?
It's not for everybody.
We sign, and there's all this hype leading up to our next record.
This picture is a typical seasonal grassland.
This picture is a typical seasonal grassland.
They put 25,000 sheep in one flock, really mimicking nature now with planned grazing, and they have documented a 50-percent increase in the production of the land in the first year.
I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this.
That's visible to our eye, but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.
Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and is a form of defense.
And then he got so excited, he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better, and the giant didn't run away, so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible, bringing a creature of legend from the misty history into high-resolution video.
There's so many of you.
So broken heartstrings bled the blues, and we tried to empty ourselves so we'd feel nothing.
As if depression is something that could be remedied by any of the contents found in a first-aid kit.
And I do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward.
We'll put you on the cover of Wired magazine.
Our attitude is, "Well, look, if you can get the advertising donated, you know, to air at four o'clock in the morning, I'm okay with that.
Well, charity became their answer.
Who cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if it's tiny?
A lot of people won't take them, or stop taking them, because of their unpleasant side effects.
So in this way, by doing this kind of test, we can draw cause and effect relationships between the activity of specific neurons in particular circuits and particular behaviors, something that is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to do right now in humans.
So doing the screen, we discovered one mutant that took much longer than normal to calm down after the air puffs, and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation, it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor.
Now, extinction is a different kind of death.
This had been the most abundant bird in the world that'd been in North America for six million years.
Another keystone species is a famous animal called the European aurochs.
Add them all up and the result won't be perfect.
So what they're doing is working with seven breeds of primitive, hardy-looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there to rebuild, over time, with selective back-breeding, the aurochs.
In the case of this little example I'm holding, we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light.
So a little over three years ago, Kirsty Boyle and I started a project we called Open Materials.
Just like Jordan and so many other makers, Hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them.
It was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department, but it obviously worked really well, and we all saw what happened with the Internet.
It was incredibly successful.
Another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is, you may remember a couple of years ago, all the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in Salt Lake City had a bug in it.
There was basically a factory of industrial machines.
It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet.
And the way the Internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places, and this one processor, because of a broken card, decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time.
So, in other words, it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it.
So, in other words, it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it.
Now, in fact, they couldn't do it for a lot of reasons today.
It's turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system, where we've designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have.
And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet and saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that, you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather, or something like that.
So if you see one of these maps of the Internet, it's just somebody's guess.
Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now because it's different than it was an hour ago.
So there's been plenty of people, plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years, but it's very hard to get people focused on plan B when plan A seems to be working so well.
In fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack.
And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size.
And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size.
CA: How?
Most people choose to lease.
And the thing about solar power is that it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs, so once it's installed, it's just there.
EM: Since our primary competitors are national governments, the enforceability of patents is questionable.  CA: That's really, really interesting.
You've never seen this before. A rocket blasting off and then -- EM: Yeah, so that rocket is about the size of a 12-story building.
Is that -- could we have some of that secret sauce?
What's a drug? A drug is made up of a small molecule of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and a few other atoms all cobbled together in a shape, and it's those shapes that determine whether, in fact, that particular drug is going to hit its target.
That's the good news.
How do we go faster?
Let me show you a video of what that does to the cell.
Well again, by knowing something about the molecular pathways, it was possible to pick one of those many, many compounds that might have been useful and try it out.
The first drug for HIV/AIDS was not developed for HIV/AIDS.
It was developed for cancer. It was AZT.
Let me tell you another thing we could do.
Suppose we could do this instead on human cells.
And then the clouds came over us, and then, boom! This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain.
We deal in milliseconds.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones?
Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones?
Well, the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface.
Well, the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface.
It's an umbrella of air all across it, and that layer of air is what the water hits, the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.
We're going to use an unusual combination of tools from game theory and neuroscience to understand how people interact socially when value is on the line.
An equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody has figured out exactly what everyone else will do.
Now they get three apple cubes.
And number two, obviously, this dependence upon the Lesters is going to produce a subtle, understated, we could say camouflaged, bending to keep the Lesters happy.
Climate change is mine, but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax system or inequality.
Climate change is mine, but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax system or inequality.
When Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in September of 1787, he was stopped in the street by a woman who said, "Mr. Franklin, what have you wrought?"
We have lost that republic.
Back in 1995, we got a new wing next to the museum.
The building was a true bird-killer.
And here's a rare picture of a duck's penis, so it was indeed of the male sex.
This is its first time on the U.S. West Coast.
Yeah?
So what this bird does is fight his own image.
[6 Mile Range] [Top Speed Near 20mph] [Uphill Climbing] [Regenerative Braking]   So we're going to show you what this thing can do.
And if you think about mountain climbing as an example, it suggests all kinds of things.
It suggests that we care about reaching the end, a peak.
It suggests that we care about the fight, about the challenge.
In the second condition, people did not write their name on it.
The experimenter looked at it, took the sheet of paper, did not look at it, did not scan it, and simply put it on the pile of pages.
So you take a piece, you just put it on the side.
They could have done not so good work, because they realized people were just shredding it.
Would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder, or somewhere in the middle?
It was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say, "Here is my cake."
But then we told them, "Look, this origami really belongs to us.
And we measured how much they were willing to pay for it.
Now you could say -- if you were a builder, do you think [you'd say], "Oh, I love this origami, but I know that nobody else would love it?"
Turns out the builders not only loved the origami more, they thought that everybody would see the world in their view.
So now this was tougher. What happened?
And when I throw this up into the air and catch it, it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein, all of the intricacies.
And this is like robotics without wires or motors.
And later, in the mid-'80s, when "Jeopardy" came back on the air, I remember running home from school every day to watch the show.
But then you see the line start to go up.
It's not the Terminator's gun sight; it's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do, the only thing that makes you special, the thing you're best at.
But not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach, because this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before.
Now when facts come in handy like that -- I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact, one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time -- normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life.
But in this case it happened in real life.
And it happens in real life all the time.
On the one hand, we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than it's ever been in human history, where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips.
Aristotle said, "Excellence is never an accident.
It is the result of high intention, sincere effort and intelligent execution.
And it's dependent on passive patients who just take it and don't ask any questions.
Now the problem with this model is that it's unsustainable globally.
We need to invent what I call a personal health system.
This is a portable ultrasound.
For example, ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports.
And that's because it's such an enraging, yet engaging place to be.
You'll have heard of cholera, but we don't hear about diarrhea.
The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last 200 years by the readers of the British Medical Journal, and they were choosing over the Pill, anesthesia, and surgery.
It's a wonderful waste disposal device.
It's a wonderful waste disposal device.
Think about it. That little boy who's running back into his house, he may have a nice, clean fresh water supply, but he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with.
It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it in the early 20th century.
They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it.
It's what I call social contagion, and it's really powerful and really exciting.
I hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do.
When we talk about the brain, it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic.
Here we're talking about traffic jams, or sometimes detours, or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions.
But Chopin was on the radio, seven beautiful mazurkas, and I pulled into a lot by a gas station to listen and to calm.
We have to be in the good and enjoy the good, study and work and adventure and friendship -- oh, friendship -- and community and love.
So as I said, neurosurgery comes from a long tradition.
So this is very much like choosing the correct station on the radio dial.
The brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose.
That's what speech is like.
Speech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic.
No, and so therefore why would you when you were texting?
Now we can write the way we talk.
A pragmatic particle, that's what LOL has gradually become.
What if I try to fit a curved line to this historical record?
That's the percentage of American agricultural land it took to feed the horses.
We're not doing as well at that job as we should be.
After a lag, productivity accelerated again.
So maybe "history doesn't repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes."
Today, productivity is at an all-time high, and despite the Great Recession, it grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s, the roaring 1990s, and that was faster than the '70s or '80s.
You know, it's not surprising that millions of people have become disillusioned by the great decoupling, but like too many others, they misunderstand its basic causes.
Technology is racing ahead, but it's leaving more and more people behind.
But today a computer is no longer the world chess champion.
JY: Every year, at least 470 million pounds of phthalates contaminate our air, water and soil.
Our bacteria can transform phthalates, which is a harmful toxin, into end products such as carbon dioxide, water and alcohol.
I slammed on the brakes.
Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day, which is more than we're sleeping, at 7.7 hours.
And the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this is, you've got these rods that are clad in zirconium, and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets.
Carbon-free electricity.
They're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky.
Is this job tough? You betcha. Oh God, you betcha.
When I was a kid, it was more than 50 percent rainforest.
Here's what happened to this company.
So lesson number one: Sisyphus.
Who created that business model? Right?
It wasn't about the customers.
You plant them in the spring.
They told me, "Geoff, if you get this PalmPilot you'll never need another thing."
Children are natural learners.
And your dog may get depressed.
It's dormant.
The system we have today isn't fair to them.
But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country.
You can see her pointing to it in the picture.
And now, if I touch this piece of pizza, the slides that I showed you before should go forward.
I love when people put humans on the diagram.
Most people cannot play them that way.  And when this started to get serious, I thought, I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in, because otherwise people are going to be getting this and they're going to be turning into agents of creative change, and governments will be crumbling, and I wouldn't have told people, so I thought I'd better warn them.
I've put worksheets online, so if you'd like, you can plan your own end.
But that was the vision behind Glass, and that's why we've created this form factor.
And also you want something that frees your eyes.
Fortunately, more and more people are understanding this idea, and the result is a growing movement: effective altruism.
But it's really important to use the head as well to make sure that what you do is effective and well-directed, and not only that, but also I think reason helps us to understand that other people, wherever they are, are like us, that they can suffer as we can, that parents grieve for the deaths of their children, as we do, and that just as our lives and our well-being matter to us,
Here's Sisyphus as portrayed by Titian, condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder up to the top of the hill.
Their stories became the art as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas.
So the end image was never visible as a physical whole.
And in a way it should be kind of obvious, right, that in the 21st century, maybe cities can be developed by citizens.
And the parts are all numbered, and basically what you end up with is a really big IKEA kit.
Like, never designing a piece that can't be lifted up.
Like, never designing a piece that can't be lifted up.
They're self-made cities in one form or another.
I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center, but also hospitals, churches, prisons, and restricted facilities for leprosy patients, just to mention a few.
Changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world.
So the first large mammoth that appears on the scene is meridionalis, which was standing four meters tall weighing about 10 tons, and was a woodland-adapted species and spread from Western Europe clear across Central Asia, across the Bering land bridge and into parts of North America.
And so by doing that, we can actually get all the little points that discriminate between a mammoth and an Asian elephant, and what do we know, then, about a mammoth?
Or good design is digital fonts that we use all the time and that become part of our identity.
The Wind Map, by Wattenberg and Fernanda Viégas, I don't know if you've ever seen it -- it's really fantastic.
I'm bringing in the end of the world. You know?
The International Cat Video Film Festival didn't have that much of a reaction.  I think this was truly fantastic.
And the same with, for instance, Tetris, original version, the Soviet one.
Dwarf Fortress is like the holy grail of this kind of massive multiplayer online game, and in fact the two Adams brothers were in Reykjavík, and they were greeted by a standing ovation by all the Eve Online fans.
But I see that people are coming along, that the audiences, paradoxically, are much more responsive and much more understanding of this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are.
I'm going to share with you a paradigm-shifting perspective on the issues of gender violence -- sexual assault, domestic violence, relationship abuse, sexual harassment, sexual abuse of children.
It's almost like a chip in our brain is activated, and the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction when we hear the term "women's issues."
In the U.S., when we hear the word "race," a lot of people think that means African-American, Latino, Asian-American, Native American, South Asian, Pacific Islander, on and on.
A lot of people, when they hear the word "sexual orientation" think it means gay, lesbian, bisexual.
Utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy.
If you have extreme diseases, you need to get extreme remedies.
Now, we do know some things about how sounds are used with certain behaviors.
I'm going to drop the rope, see if they come over.
And because of this, we really decided we needed some more sophisticated technology.
Our economies in the developed world have coasted along on something pretty close to full employment.
Which brings up a critical question: Why is this time different, if it really is?
They're living these amazingly busy, productive lives, and they've got all the benefits to show from that, while Bill is leading a very different life.
I witnessed this firsthand.
It's set in Montreal some 50 years in the future.
So if you don't have money to offer to people, you must strike their imagination with something as nice as you can think of.
This baseball model is incredibly problematic.
It's sexist. It's heterosexist.
It's competitive. It's goal-directed.
I'm here today to offer you that new model.
"Huh. I could go for some pizza."
And also, of course, with baseball, there's, like, the specific equipment and a specific skill set.
If you eat too much, though, you just feel gross.
And if the lighting isn't too extreme -- Ah, ah! There it is. It's picked up the object off the conveyor.
The eyes look ahead where the robot's going to move.
So a person that's interacting with the robot understands where it's going to reach and isn't surprised by its motions.
He's going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from.
He's going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from.
She's worked on the line for over 20 years.
She decided she really liked robots.
It becomes a little bit more difficult when I only have one foot on the ground and when I don't use my hands.
Once we have a model of the combined quad-pole system, we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it.
Once we have a model of the combined quad-pole system, we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it.
And that's why you don't need to model the glass.
Will the vaulter stick the landing?
We first figure out where the ball is going.
What I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor mainly used in gaming.
We now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures.
Take this quad, for example.
It's trying to stay at a fixed point in space.
It's trying to stay at a fixed point in space.
Once we know this force, we can also change the laws of physics, as far as the quad is concerned, of course.
They find me up on the top terrace.
Because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons.
So I drove. I posted a video on YouTube.
But what I was sure of was my innocence.
[BBC News: 'End of virginity' if women drive, Saudi cleric warns]  And only then we realized it's so empowering to mock your oppressor.
We are minors until the day we die.
At the same time, I flew back to my home country, they hated that speech so much.
The Shura Council that's appointed by the king, by royal decree of King Abdullah, last year there were 30 women assigned to that Council, like 20 percent.
Three weeks after my presentation, the markets lost 20 percent and went through a phase of volatility, upheaval, and a total market loss of 70 percent until the end of the year.
We do our work. We write a report in which we put our prediction of the critical time.
Over the last 28 years, this tough, grinding, dirty work has been done by literally thousands of people around Australia and, more recently, overseas, and their work has proven that focused design can improve even the poorest living environments.
He controls dust on mining company sites.
It was during the design of the first toilet that I went for lunch, invited by the family into their main room of the house.
We did that with the support of different organizations like the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network.
You have to choose to believe in hope.
You have to make it yourself.
Fear was the only sane response, the only human response.
It involves an ongoing struggle, a continual questioning of what we think we know, a wrestling with issues and ideas.
He'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism.
But what I've found going around the world and talking to whistleblowers is, actually, they're very loyal and quite often very conservative people.
We all enjoy so many freedoms today, hard-won freedoms: the freedom to write and publish without fear of censorship, a freedom that wasn't here the last time I came to Hungary; a freedom to vote, which women in particular had to fight so hard for; the freedom for people of different ethnicities and cultures and sexual orientation to live the way that they want.
When I went to Libby, Montana, I visited the asbestosis clinic that Gayla Benefield brought into being, a place where at first some of the people who wanted help and needed medical attention went in the back door because they didn't want to acknowledge that she'd been right.
She's like you, and she's like me.
What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all?
What if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell?
So now, when insulin says to a cell, I want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says, "No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy."
I don't know how this journey is going to end, but this much seems clear to me, at least: We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like I did.
Now, you would think, well, look, most of you laughed at that.
In general, that seems like a funny cartoon, but let's look what online survey I did.
Generally, about 85 percent of the people liked it.
We now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate, to turn in so that it will produce the other tissues.
The thylacine looks a bit, to most people, like a dog, or maybe like a tiger, because it has stripes.
But it's not related to any of those. It's a marsupial.
Have a look at this bit of film footage.
Have a look at this bit of film footage.
And I was studying skulls, trying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals, and I saw this jar, and here, in the jar, was a little girl thylacine pup, perhaps six months old.
That Tasmanian devil's not even going to know it gave birth.
And it's sort of in the future, we haven't got there yet, but it's the kind of thing we want to think about.
In other words, if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine DNA, it would be able to be recognized.
This is a key question for everybody.
Does it have to stay in a laboratory, or could we put it back where it belongs?
We were taught that grand story day in and day out.
But before we get there, we're engaged in a struggle between good and evil.
Now, most political scientists will tell us that a one-party system is inherently incapable of self-correction.
For the hundred or so countries that are ranked below China, more than half of them are electoral democracies.
It cannot be exported. But that is the point precisely.
EXL: You know, Frank Fukuyama, the political scientist, called the Chinese system "responsive authoritarianism."
Now we knew when we built this system, the whole point of it, just like with the PalmPilots, was that you'd be able to collect the data and immediately upload the data and get your data set.
What happened after we did this?
These clouds form in the region of mountains.
The sharp, crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in.
You're not going to change the world by lying on your back and gazing up at the sky, are you?
We discovered bluegrass a few years ago, and we fell in love with it. We hope you guys will too.
So, what does a plant need in order to grow?
DNA is our genetic heritage.
Now, where do we find this phosphorus?
Now, where will we get this phosphorus from?
I've been fascinated by this little mushroom for over 16 years now.
Normally, a root will find phosphorus all by itself.
Normally, a root will find phosphorus all by itself.
Beyond one millimeter, the root is ineffective.
I haven’t invented anything at all; it's a biotechnology that has existed for 450 million years.
Looking closer, we can see that this mushroom is very gentle in its penetration.
The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms.
Well, because an elite and its facilitators have been making millions of dollars from supporting logging on an industrial scale for many years.
A recent study by the World Bank looked at 200 cases of corruption.
It found that over 70 percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies, totaling almost 56 billion dollars.
In 1999, when Global Witness called for oil companies to make payments on deals transparent, well, some people laughed at the extreme naiveté of that small idea.
My grandfather taught me to work with wood when I was a little boy, and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something, honor that tree's life and make it as beautiful as you possibly can.
You'll notice that transportation's sort of second down that list, but that's the conversation we mostly hear about.
As an architect, wood is the only material, big material, that I can build with that's already grown by the power of the sun.
When a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen and soaks up carbon dioxide, and it dies and it falls to the forest floor, it gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground.
If it burns in a forest fire, it's going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well.
If I asked you to take a match and light it and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire, it doesn't happen, right? We all know that.
What I wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control.
What was remarkable is, they explored this keyboard on their own. There was no intervention on our part.
They explored the keyboard. They played around with it.
I went down, and the bonobos had had access to percussion instruments, musical toys, but never before to a keyboard.
Forty years ago, Bob Kahn and I did the design of the Internet.
And so I'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task, and finally, on the 4,000th try, when I'm close to losing my sanity, I find the protein.
And the name of the protein I'd located was called mesothelin, and it's just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill type protein, unless, of course, you have pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer, in which case it's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream.
Making a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple as making chocolate chip cookies, which I love.
This makes it 168 times faster, over 26,000 times less expensive, and over 400 times more sensitive than our current standard for pancreatic cancer detection.
The static-like sounds that are very low, that you're going to hear right now.
Yeah, but watch. When it didn't find anything to eat --   I think that's an expression that can be understood in any language.
And home, we know, is not just the place where you happen to be born.
You all know that crazy system, six days in hell, you get the seventh day free.
You all know that crazy system, six days in hell, you get the seventh day free.
The whole place was absolutely silent, but the silence wasn't an absence of noise.
And home, in the end, is of course not just the place where you sleep.
And four: Horn used to store energy in compression.
We are living in an age of surging income inequality, particularly between those at the very top and everyone else.
They also happen to be particularly adept at working the international tax system so as to lower their tax bill very, very significantly.
The same is true of globalization.
And I was also really interested in wireless as well.
I ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere.
This is one of them, because I love cake.
This is one of them, because I love cake.
And this one, it's a large poster, and you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it, and the poster talks to you when you touch it and asks you a series of questions, and it works out your perfect cake.
But it doesn't tell you the cake there and then.
I'll just describe how this works.
I'll just describe how this works.
This poster is wirelessly connected to my cell phone, and when you touch it, it connects to the app.
And it has really good response time.
Why consciousness?
Now why is that curious?
And then, even when they're not saying appalling things and they're really trying to do serious research, well, it's been slow. Progress has been slow.
One feature is the tradition of religious dualism: Consciousness is not a part of the physical world.
It's a part of the spiritual world.
That tradition thinks that we are heavy-duty scientific materialists: Consciousness is not a part of the physical world.
One: Consciousness does not exist.
So consciousness is an illusion.
It's embarrassing how influential behaviorism was, but I'll get back to that.
People always say consciousness is very hard to define.
Consciousness consists of all those states of feeling or sentience or awareness.
Let's specify the exact features of consciousness, so that we can then answer those four objections that I made to it.
Well, the first feature is, it's real and irreducible.
It's real and irreducible.
The disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we don't know how to make a conscious robot, so we don't have a machine that can do this kind of thing.
I mean, we don't know the detailed answer, but we know the basic part of the answer, and that is, there is a sequence of neuron firings, and they terminate where the acetylcholine is secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons.
Okay, now with that in mind, with going through these various features of consciousness, let's go back and answer some of those early objections.
I don't think we need to worry about that.
It's really a digital computer program running in your brain and that's what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program.
We know that actual human consciousness has something more than that.
It's got a content in addition to the syntax.
Now that argument, I made that argument 30 -- oh my God, I don't want to think about it — more than 30 years ago, but there's a deeper argument implicit in what I've told you, and I want to tell you that argument briefly, and that is, consciousness creates an observer-independent reality.
Okay, I promised to refute all these guys, and I don't have an awful lot of time left, but let me refute a couple more of them.
People are actually trusting businesspeople more than they're trusting governments and leaders.
In that context, you can see that networks like Bitcoin suddenly start to make a bit more sense.
We cannot predict the future.
My belief is that the airplane of the future will get its own consciousness.
This will be very different in the future.
So how does nature build its components and structures?
This fantasy of invulnerability was so complete that I even deceived myself, and as the first semester ended and the second began, there was no way that anyone could have predicted what was just about to happen.
"She is going to a lecture."
So, for example, if I was angry and had to hide it, which I often did, being very adept at concealing how I really felt, then the voice would sound frustrated.
A hospital admission followed, the first of many, a diagnosis of schizophrenia came next, and then, worst of all, a toxic, tormenting sense of hopelessness, humiliation and despair about myself and my prospects.
You see that glass of water?
Throughout all of this, what I would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself, and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that I'd never had an opportunity to process or resolve, memories of sexual trauma and abuse, of anger, shame, guilt, low self-worth.
Together, we envisage and enact a society that understands and respects voice hearing, supports the needs of individuals who hear voices, and which values them as full citizens.
This type of society is not only possible, it's already on its way.
And there were these incredible artists that felt for me like an eternity as they performed.
What is the abstraction?
So now I'm going to show you some clips from the other big project of my life this year, "The Tempest."
It's a movie. I did "The Tempest" on a stage three times in the theater since 1984, '86, and I love the play.
JT: Okay.
So I went from theater, doing "The Tempest" on the stage in a very low-budget production many years ago, and I love the play, and I also think it's Shakespeare's last play, and it really lends itself, as you can see, to cinema.
So in the theater, I started the play, it was a black sand rake, white cyc, and there was a little girl, Miranda, on the horizon, building a drip castle, a sand castle.
And as she was there on the edge of that stage, two stagehands all in black with watering cans ran along the top and started to pour water on the sand castle, and the sand castle started to drip and sink, but before it did, the audience saw the black-clad stagehands.

I'm on the precipice looking down into a dead volcano to my left.
Motor racing is a funny old business.
The other thing about Formula 1 in particular is we're always changing the car.
We have a lot of sensors on the car to measure things.
We are thinking big. It's the right thing to do.
With wireless connectivity these days, there is no reason why patients, doctors and nurses always have to be in the same place at the same time.
The Arabic language doesn't satisfy today's needs.
If we did so, they'd strip us of our clothes.
That's why they legislate to protect their language.
They make it sacred.
They make it sacred.
Countries that were once like us, but decided to strive for development, do research, and catch up with those countries, such as Turkey, Malaysia and others, they carried their language with them as they were climbing the ladder, protected it like a diamond.
They kept it close to them.
Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it's not labeled in Turkish, then it isn't a local product.
A single novel could make us global again.
So I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine.
This system has -- thank you, beautiful assistant -- this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it, so there's no prerecorded samples of any kind.

Impossible, you say. No.
Think of a mathematician's argument.
The argument-as-war metaphor is just ... it's a monster.

It's just taken up habitation in our mind, and there's no magic bullet that's going to kill it.
Here's my clock.
Respondents said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level.
The Akan of people of Ghana and [Cote d'Ivoire] developed Adinkra symbols some 400 years ago, and these are proverbs, historical sayings, objects, animals, plants, and my favorite Adinkra system is the first one at the top on the left.
Now Nanny's great other insight was to think, perhaps we should get Derek something to play, and sure enough, she dragged this little keyboard out of the loft, never thinking really that anything much would come of it.

Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said, "Sorry, do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee' in B minor instead of A minor?" as we went on.
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church.
Then, in Taiwan, they had a big earthquake, and we proposed to donate this church, so we dismantled them, we sent them over to be built by volunteer people.
Then I wonder, what is a permanent and what is a temporary building?
What I'd like to do today is talk about one of my favorite subjects, and that is the neuroscience of sleep.
And yet, for most of us, we don't give sleep a second thought.
Well, of course, we use Thomas Edison's light bulb to invade the night, and we occupied the dark, and in the process of this occupation, we've treated sleep as an illness, almost.
Now, here we have a brain.
Now, here we have a brain.
This is donated by a social scientist, and they said they didn't know what it was or indeed, how to use it, so --  Sorry.
OK. So where have we got to?
What's turned out to be really exciting is that our ability to come up with novel solutions to complex problems is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep.
But sleep is not an indulgence.
Shift work. Shift work is extraordinary, perhaps 20 percent of the working population, and the body clock does not shift to the demands of working at night.
Now alcohol, short-term, you know, once or twice, to use to mildly sedate you, can be very useful.
A biological mimic for sleep, it sedates you.
So it actually harms some of the neural processing that's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall.
What's the connection here?
Well, sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin, Ghrelin is released. It gets to the brain.
Make your bedroom a haven for sleep.
Make your bedroom a haven for sleep.
But I stand before you today not as a breakfast radio host, not as a comedian, but as someone who was, is, and always will be a mathematician.
I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages.
My skill is not in the mathematics.
This number is almost 17 and a half million digits long.
That's the way it goes.
It wasn't my highlight of 2012.
And what was so gorgeous about this discovery was 50 years ago Peter Higgs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions: How is it that the things that make us up have no mass?
That's what is so exciting for me about this prime number.
Over 60,000 people came to the start line, all wearing white T-shirts with no political slogans.
You know, the marathon has really become one of its kind.
Now one brain region that would be robustly active in particular is called the hippocampus, which for decades has been implicated in processing the kinds of memories that we hold near and dear, which also makes it an ideal target to go into and to try and find and maybe reactivate a memory.
It shouldn't take minutes or hours to work.
So your best response of defense is trying to be undetected.
Whenever a mouse is in fear, it will show this very typical behavior by staying at one corner of the box, trying to not move any part of its body, and this posture is called freezing.
Those kinds of fleeting thoughts that physically incapacitate you, that temporarily give you that deer-in-headlights look.
XL: And this is what we saw.
But the moment we turned on the laser, like you see now, all of a sudden the mouse entered this freezing mode.
["OMGGGGG FINALLY... so much more to come, virtual reality, neural manipulation, visual dream emulation... neural coding, 'writing and re-writing of memories', mental illnesses. Ahhh the future is awesome"] SR: So the first thing that you'll notice is that people have really strong opinions about this kind of work.
Now I happen to completely agree with the optimism of this first quote, because on a scale of zero to Morgan Freeman's voice, it happens to be one of the most evocative accolades that I've heard come our way.
We can shoot light into the brain to reactivate the memory of the blue box.
There's more to this painting than meets the eye.
There's more to this painting than meets the eye.
And yes, it's an acrylic painting of a man, but I didn't paint it on canvas.
I painted it directly on top of the man.
It was about shadows.
It was about shadows.
I had turned my friend into a painting.
The last time I'd painted, I was 16 years old at summer camp, and I didn't want to teach myself how to paint by copying the old masters or stretching a canvas and practicing over and over again on that surface, because that's not what this project was about for me.
I came together with a collaborator, Sheila Vand, and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface, and that was milk.
We got a pool. We filled it with milk.
But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin.
Well, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain.
It also acts on your body, and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress.
It's a natural anti-inflammatory.
And it was only when I stumbled across an unfamiliar word that I began to understand what I was looking for.
stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, the plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain, which stimulate the growth of zooplankton, which feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it.
Rewilding, to me, means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals.
It doesn't try to produce a heath or a meadow or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef.
Our latest engagement is the Cleveland Museum of Art, which we've created an engagement called Gallery One for.
Visitors are transient. We want people who live here, people who have ownership."
And so what we're doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries, so you can still have a traditional gallery experience, but if you're interested, you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it's from, or manipulate the work itself.
And so what we started with was really a new way of thinking about building an institution, through a project called Make History, which we launched in 2009.
And so we created this idea of an opening gallery called We Remember.
Voice 1: 9/11 was not just a New York experience.
When I was in high school, I got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder, and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer medium of learning.
How very wrong I was.
In 1987, in the month our eldest son Gerard was born, I got my first blind computer, and it's actually here.
See it up there?
It's a Keynote Gold 84k, and the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory.
Don't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time.  I think there's more memory in my watch.
It meant, for the first time, I could read back what I had typed into it.
For a small fee, they can upload it and make sure everything is good.
What I'm going to do is open up a website that I wrote.
It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics.
That website address at the top there, which you can just about see, microshaft.com, the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs, and up pops fake antivirus.
That website address at the top there, which you can just about see, microshaft.com, the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs, and up pops fake antivirus.
This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software, and it will go through and it will scan the system, have a look at what its popping up here.
He's got lots of cool information in front of him, high-tech equipment, he's got cameras, he's got a little phone that he can pick up, listen to the ears, all these senses, all these perceptions.
So if I could control how you spend your attention, if I could maybe steal your attention through a distraction.
Now, let's try that again.
Hold your hand out flat. Open it up.
It's amazingly obvious now, isn't it?
If you're watching this little token, this obviously has become a little target, like a red herring.
If we watch this kind of close, it looks like it goes away.
It's not back on your shoulder.
It falls out of the air, lands right back in the hand.
Yeah, funny. We've got a little guy. He's union, works up there all day.
If I do it slowly it goes straight away, it lands by your pocket.
AR: You've entertained all of these people in a wonderful way, better than you know.
Attention is a powerful thing.
Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers with a hand-held vibrator.
Now this one's the tomato tickler.  Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the flower, the anther, and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.
Humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times.
Let me put this all together for you.
And those algorithms, whilst being kind of useful, are also very, very narrow, and we can do better than that, because we can realize that their complexity is not random.
And we should begin by reimagining leather.
I emphasize leather because it is so widely used.
Growing leather is also technically simpler than growing other animal products like meat.
It mainly uses one cell type, and it is largely two-dimensional.
This collagen is the stuff between cells.
It's natural connective tissue.
This leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet, a handbag or a car seat.
And because we make this material, we grow this leather from the ground up, we can control its properties in very interesting ways.
Titus was so bitter.
And if we asked the leading "smashed" question, the witnesses told us the cars were going faster, and moreover, that leading "smashed" question caused people to be more likely to tell us that they saw broken glass in the accident scene when there wasn't any broken glass at all.
Even though I'd never mentioned her name, she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.
When I got back to my work, I asked this question: if I plant a false memory in your mind, does it have repercussions?
Now I know this is different than the way most people think about science.
So I did start teaching this course on ignorance, and it's been quite interesting and I'd like to tell you to go to the website.
How about the visual system?
And our minds have altered, too.
Luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age, and he found that these people were resistant to classifying the concrete world.
If a wise person came from the North Pole and told me the bears were white, I might believe him, but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear."
They were things like, why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital?
That's what makes you hold it in and hide it.
And I don't know what the solution is.
I wish I did, but I don't -- but I think, I think it has to start here.
Depression is okay. If you're going through it, know that you're okay.
And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah in what is now Israel.
And there's artillery, and artillery are archers, but, more importantly, slingers.
It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.
And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it, principally having to do with vision.
So every year, thousands of visitors come to Tana Toraja to see, as it were, this culture of death, and for many people these grandiose ceremonies and the length of the ceremonies are somehow incommensurable with the way that we face our own mortality in the West.
So the funeral ceremony itself embodies this relational perspective on death.
And it's also a moment of self-awareness.
But I want to ask what we can gain from seeing physical death not only as a biological process but as part of the greater human story.
You've got to date around.
So I said, fine, from here on out I'm only going on dates where I know there's Wi-Fi, and I'm bringing my laptop.
The first one has to do with making sound visible.
Now in Los Angeles, you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches, but I got mine indoors, and what happened is that, if you're shooting at 3,000 frames per second, you need to have a silly amount of light, lots of lights.
And it's got tiny little particles of metal in it, which makes it magnetic.
And what I have here is an empty glass vessel.
It's got nothing in it.
So what happened is that the flame traveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom, burning the mix of the air molecules and the alcohol.
But the real question is, what will become of these kids later?
Here's why.
The classic example is pollution.
The work of a transportation commissioner isn't just about stop signs and traffic signals.
So it was all about the data.
You can see the map in 2007.
And today, cyclists look like New York City looks.
After all, it was Yitzhak Rabin himself who said, "You don't make peace with your friends.
And this I had heard about before.
And they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights.
At its very best, the Western model speaks for itself.
It's the model that put food on the table.
It's the refrigerators.
We might have to tear those books up and start to look at other options and be open-minded to seek the truth.
So we know what it's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars.
The economist Joe Cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those 11 minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all income earned in the region.
Was it designed around cars or around people?
So a fundamental shift, and now you have environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser saying we are a destructive species.
I'm looking for a cure.
So we need to think more constructively about this very common, very profound and very powerful human emotion.
The overwhelming presence of hope isn't denial.
so that it is overlaid on the face of the subject, an example of augmented reality, probably a creepy example of augmented reality.
In a movie which came out a few years ago, "Minority Report," a famous scene had Tom Cruise walk in a mall and holographic personalized advertising would appear around him.
So I do believe that one of the defining fights of our times will be the fight for the control over personal information, the fight over whether big data will become a force for freedom, rather than a force which will hiddenly manipulate us.
HP:   YR: Needless to say, I would like to apologize to any Mandarin speakers in the audience.
As a child, I would hate being made to wear the Indian kurta pajama, because I didn't think it was very cool.
It felt a bit girly to me, like a dress, and it had this baggy trouser part you had to tie really tight to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down.
My dad never wore it, so I didn't see why I had to.
Also, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable, that people assume I represent something genuinely Indian when I wear it, because that's not how I feel.
Be formless, shapeless, like water.
Now you put water into a cup. It becomes the cup.
You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
HP: Okay. So this imitation business does come with risk.
It's really dirty in production.
So the message here is, measure what you care about and lead the change, and don't wait a hundred years.
If you go back to Imperial Rome in the Year 1 A.D., there was admittedly about 1,800 years where there wasn't an awful lot of growth.
It wasn't a "Hindu rate of growth," "democracies can't grow." Actually India could.
Space-time underwent a phase transition.
During this phase transition, empty space became filled with a substance that we now call Higgs field.
And this substance may seem invisible to us, but it has a physical reality.
And some elementary particles interact with this substance, gaining energy in the process.
Our calculations showed that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass is very special.
Then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse.
In principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes of any slope angle in a beach, and yet, the slope angles of sand dunes are typically around 30, 35 degrees.
It's the whole book.
Now, the flow of time is embedded in everything, in the erosion of a grain of sand, in the budding of a little bud into a rose.
Are you reading an interview by an author?
Find other people reading those books.
There are those who went back to their lives, and those who are still displaced after so many months.
What I had with my grandfather was wrapped so often in information and knowledge and fact, but it was about so much more than information or knowledge or fact.
One of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention, and definitely from my grandmother, love and attention were one and the same thing.
The digital world cannibalizes time, and in doing so, I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves.
And there is a kind of heroic resilience, a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at 5 a.m.
Now radiation or not, these women are at the end of their lives.
To put these numbers in perspective, Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.
But the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area.
You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting.
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store?
Der Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies.
Essentially, for three reasons: calculation, application, and last, and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it, inspiration.
Now let me ask you a simple question: what is the area of the rectangle?
That's the area.
Two days later, my sight started to fail.
But one time I was in Oakland walking along Broadway, and came to a corner.
Having an economy, though, that relates to commodities can give you some ups and some downs, and that was certainly the case in Oklahoma City's history.
People were signing up, and so the pounds started to add up, and the conversation that I thought was so important to have was starting to take place.
It was taking place inside the homes, mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids.
And I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine, the same magazine that had put us on that list five years before.
Today I am going to teach you how to play my favorite game: massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.
Don't start wrestling yet.
Don't start wrestling yet.
Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check.
You learned, from scratch, a game you never knew before.
Other researchers might want to fly the drone along the boundaries of a forest to watch out for poachers or people who might be trying to enter the forest illegally.
And often we'll go about this mission taking pictures or videos along the way, and usually at that point, we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee, sit back, and relax for the next few minutes, although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes worrying that the drone will not return.
During its mission, it can even transmit a live video feed back to a ground station laptop, which allows the user to see what the drone is seeing in real time.
All of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding of the very spooky conditions under which male lions do their hunting.
So in order to put together a conservation plan for these unique, important corridors like the western Amazon and the Andes Amazon corridor, we have to start making geographically explicit plans now.
My family and I bought our first and only home on December 13, 2001, a fixer-upper in a beautiful spot of Los Altos Hills, California, from where I am speaking to you now.
This can transport a small payload today, about two kilograms, over a short distance, about 10 kilometers, but it's part of a wider network that may cover the entire country, maybe even the entire continent.
It's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network.
It's a network for a transportation of matter.
It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer, it's bidirectional, highly adaptable, with very low infrastructure investment, very low ecological footprint.
If it is a new paradigm, though, there must be other uses for it.
China alone is adding a megacity the size of New York City every two years.
You're going it right now.
It's not something we can turn off.
Now working memory has four basic components.
It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge.
Now the current goal isn't something like, I want to be president or the best surfer in the world.
Now working memory capacity is our ability to leverage that, our ability to take what we know and what we can hang onto and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy our current goal.
And it's going to be really important here at TED because you're going to be exposed to so many different ideas.
We can have a conversation, and I can build a narrative around that so I know where we've been and where we're going and how to contribute to this conversation.
It allows us to problem-solve, critical think.
It allows us to problem-solve, critical think.
It also allows us to go to the store and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese when what we're really looking for is Red Bull and bacon.  Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for.
Practice for some reason became a very negative thing.
Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message from a working memory capacity standpoint is this: what we process, we learn.
Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos, but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos, and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos, which is why scientists used to resort to saying that our brain must be special to explain our cognitive abilities.
It must be really extraordinary, an exception to the rule.
That's because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body.
The human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses.
That's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories, just to keep your brain working.
But nobody did.
So I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain, and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup.
This soup contains all the nuclei that once were a mouse brain.
So we've used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far, and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way.
But just as important is what the 86 billion neurons mean.
So the human brain may be remarkable, yes, but it is not special in its number of neurons.
So the total energetic cost of a brain is a simple, linear function of its number of neurons, and it turns out that the human brain costs just as much energy as you would expect.
So we did the math.
Studying the human brain changed the way I think about food.
Now, we can ask, what do we really mean by gratefulness?
By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment, as we say.
By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment, as we say.
It's a gift. You haven't earned it.
Now, we say the gift within this gift is really the opportunity.
Every moment is a new gift, over and over again, and if you miss the opportunity of this moment, another moment is given to us, and another moment.
It isn't as bad as it might seem.
Because we are at the present moment in the middle of a change of consciousness, and you will be surprised if you -- I am always surprised when I hear how many times this word "gratefulness" and "gratitude" comes up.
Yes, I have even come across a toilet paper whose brand is called "Thank You."  There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware how important this is and how this can change our world.
Grateful people are joyful people, and joyful people -- the more and more joyful people there are, the more and more we'll have a joyful world.
We have a network for grateful living, and it has mushroomed.
And there have been 15 million candles lit in one decade.
So what's going on here?
And you can see here, we can actually visualize a single white blood cell.
It's pretty exciting.
For example, now we can begin to explore what happens when we put a drug like an aerosol drug.
Those of you like me who have asthma, when you take your inhaler, we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs, how it enters the body, how it might affect, say, your heart.
Does it get cleared by the liver?
This is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab, and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we're going to require in order to link 10 or more organ chips together.
It does something else that's very important.
It creates an easy user interface.
You'd totally be surprised.
It was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration.
For example, if that is true, a bus with 80 passengers has a right to 80 times more road space than a car with one.
For example, if that is true, a bus with 80 passengers has a right to 80 times more road space than a car with one.
But you see, when a city is only being created, it's very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure.
So I started to get intrigued.
Shipping has quadrupled in size since 1970.
We are more dependent on it now than ever.
Now how is that possible?
A humpback can transmit a sound across a whole ocean.
And for me and my community, this project was a huge success.
But for us, the rain is good.
We just wait for the rain to go.
So what is a glacier?
Well, those of you who have ever seen or touched snow, you know that it's really light, because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together, and it's mostly air.
The name of the glacier these caves are formed in is the Sandy Glacier.
In fact, the more I mapped and studied caves, the more useful I found all that math that I originally hated in school to be.
So when you're done surveying, you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well, and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this, and it'll show you both a bird's-eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage, kind of like an ant farm view.
For example, this is a noble fir seed we found.
The croc again continues to shake me.
As it bites the second time, I kick.
And then one day we came across them at this small water hole.
Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me?
Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all.
And the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe, not just for Christians but also Jews and Muslims.
Now, the majority of people on Earth believe they have a soul, and the idea is central to many religions.
So it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void, but it wasn't rational, because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience.
Now, overcoming this bias is not easy because the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us, yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational, and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us, then we can at least start to try to minimize the influence it has on our lives.
It makes no sense for you to fear what is outside of those covers, whether before your birth or after your death.
And you needn't worry how long the book is, or whether it's a comic strip or an epic.
Many of them step very firmly to the mic, put their hands across their chest, and go, "I know you people are trying to move me out of my house, right?"
Many of them step very firmly to the mic, put their hands across their chest, and go, "I know you people are trying to move me out of my house, right?"
So many people would say to us, "What if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland?

It's jet engines, locomotives, gas turbines, medical devices, communicating seamlessly with each other and with us.
It's jet engines, locomotives, gas turbines, medical devices, communicating seamlessly with each other and with us.
The aircraft, while in flight, will communicate with technicians on the ground.
Ten years ago, that cost was 30 cents, six times as much.
First, we've already lived through mechanization of agriculture, automation of industry, and employment has gone up, because innovation is fundamentally about growth.
It makes products more affordable.
They say that all the growth-enhancing innovations are behind us.
This new technological revolution is upon us.
How do you ensure technology reaches users?
How do you ensure technology reaches users?
One of the key areas we've been working on recently is medical devices, and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with Iraq's electricity grid then, there are some commonalities.
How do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives?
And the first thing is that the product needs to be world class.
Do they all get there on time? The supply chain.
The other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile.
And this goes into my last point.
Our product needs to be designed to offer value to the end user.
in the next three years.
Isn't life about the journey, not really the destination?
The most famous body of water on the Earth today, I imagine, Cuba to Florida.
And the hypothermia sets in.
I look at that picture now, and I think, you did not need a diet, you needed a fashion consult.
That's what a thermostat does, right?
Now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter, but that's not going to change the setting on the thermostat, which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up.
If you lose a lot of weight, your brain reacts as if you were starving, and whether you started out fat or thin, your brain's response is exactly the same.
In fact, if you look only at the group with all four healthy habits, you can see that weight makes very little difference.
What if we told all those dieting girls that it's okay to eat when they're hungry?
i'm not really sure when this picture was taken.
The kind of question we're asking is Is it possible to build something like Google Maps of the past?
This is what we call, in computer science, simulation.
I'm extrapolating.
And Adam Smith, of course, the father of modern economics actually said many, many years ago, the invisible hand, which is, "If you continue to operate in your own self-interest you will do the best good for society."
And I do believe that the answer to that is going to be leadership.
And I did. And I think that's a really important part of the journey.
And I did. And I think that's a really important part of the journey.
Because I think when the book first came out, many people thought, well, this is a really important handbook for young women on their way up.
We shy away from the word "feminist," a word I really think we need to embrace.
You know, so nouveau riche, frankly.
And then there's little pretty sprigs of flowers everywhere.  And finally, that pink. That damned pink.
The object even has its own tutu.  This little flouncy, spangly, bottomy bit that sits at the bottom of the vase.
He represents the actor, Edmund Kean, playing Shakespeare's Richard III.
And he said, "As an animator, you're not a director -- you're an actor."
So, if you want to find the right motion for a character, don't think about it -- go use your body to find it.
So I went and designed frame by frame to try to make this robot as graceful and engaging as possible.
And here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop -- and I'm actually redesigning the robot, so, unbeknownst to itself, it's kind of digging its own grave by helping me.
What I found is that people actually loved the adventurous robot.
Everybody's riffing off each other, nobody is stopping for a moment.
Musicians also communicate with their bodies, with other band members, with the audience, they use their bodies to express the music.
And I started designing a socially expressive head for the robot.
I'm going to show you now the same kind of performance, this time with a socially expressive head.
And notice one thing -- how the robot is really showing us the beat it's picking up from the human, while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it's doing.
And also how it changes the way it moves as soon as it starts its own solo.
So if you have a problem -- maybe your partner is looking at their iPhone or smartphone too much -- you might want to have a robot there to get their attention.
Now to be sure, the Arab world is vast and varied.
In Egypt and many of its neighbors, this closing down is part of a wider closing in political, social and cultural thought.
The soft -- feelings, sentiments, interpersonal relationships, traits, personality.
The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation.
I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.
That night I promised myself: I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore.
The last year has seen the invention of a new four-letter word.
When my daughter turned 13, became a teenager, she stopped speaking English, and she began speaking this new language.
It's a digital language.
Boom, boom, boom, boom, the students were discussing and interacting with each other, and by 4 a.m. that night, I'm totally fascinated, having this epiphany, and by 4 a.m. in the morning, they had discovered the right answer.
And these kinds of technologies really help, the blended model can really help revolutionize education.
And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org.
I'm 13 now, and although I started my business in 2008, my artistic journey started way before then.
For example, the grinding of materials, or the dumping of dried powder materials.
I've been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children.
Do you know what he called this important piece of legislation?
I'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here.
And I also want to say one other thing: We are not going to solve this problem by building more jails or by even building more shelters.
A few short weeks ago, we packed up SkySat 1, put our signatures on it, and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth.
But I want to begin tonight by suggesting that this urban crisis is not only economic or environmental.
Now for many of you, this story might seem trivial or naive.
So here's a video.
This is a cardboard model, so the object is about as tall as I am.
It has a rounded body, two arms, and a very tall, head-like antenna, and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself.
You see the two movements integrated, and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation.
Because we are always working from a very personal space, we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of depersonalizes the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance, at least.
And this groove right here, comes from the Crescent City, the old second line.
We can envision two hypotheses: The first one consists of betting that this process of narcissistic capitalization will intensify.
Okay, let's think of why.
It's brown to start with.
Therefore, it must be good for the environment.
It's biodegradable. It's reusable.
But how do we know if we're actually reducing the net environmental impacts that our actions as individuals and as professionals and as a society are actually having on the natural environment?
So the thing about environmental folklore is it tends to be based on our experiences, the things we've heard from other people.
It's used a lot in marketing, and it's used a lot, I think, in our conversation when we're talking about sustainability, and that's the word biodegradability.
It's insane. It's 1.3 billion tons of food per annum.
1.5 million kettles, seriously problematic.
So we need to look across the entire life of the things that we do.
I said, "How come you're not doing sustainability? I know you know this."
But ESG is the measure of sustainability, and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors with financial factors into the investment process.
What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water?
In the words of the poet Longfellow, "the human voice is the organ of the soul."
We call this project VocaliD, or vocal I.D., for vocal identity.
So when I realized that those same cues are also important for speaker identity, I had this idea.
Great leaders are not head-down.
So what I'm asking today, the question I want to explore with you today is, what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality?
We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos.
Now, this evidence goes way beyond anatomy.
For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity there's one that's building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill.
Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system, and it is a deeply democratic activity.
It's about critical thinking.
It's about questioning existing ways of doing things.
And this has been incredibly effective; for the last 30, 40 years people have been doing this.
These pictures are sequenced together to form sentences, and these sentences are spoken out.
And I realized something interesting: Avaz helps children with autism learn words.
Now, meaning is really the underbelly, in some sense, of language.
We start with the word "pay," and we add the ability filter to it to make it "can pay."
In about 1997, about 15 years back, there were a group of scientists that were trying to understand how the brain processes language, and they found something very interesting.
Language is beautiful.
I think it's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented.
Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster.
Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster.
And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light?
Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy.
If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up.
Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding.
So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales?
Here is a computer simulation.
So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer, because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow.
Well, a country has many gardeners, and one of them is the government, so we have to ask the question, how is a country governed?
I hope you would agree it's important for you to know if your government is willing to invest in renewable energy and education.
I can tell that sovereign ratings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very complex global financial world, but I tell you it's a very important one, and a very important one to fix, because sovereign ratings affect all of us, and they should be addressed and should be defined as public goods.
I should note also that Gamma never actually sold their software to the Egyptian government.
Muench has said that he intends for his software to be used to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles.
Gamma is not the only company in the business.
Now, Hacking Team has what is probably the slickest presentation.
Christopher Soghoian: So, it would be funny if it wasn't true, but, in fact, Hacking Team's software is being sold to governments around the world.
Last year we learned, for example, that it's been used to target Moroccan journalists by the Moroccan government.
In fact, I saw Oliver do one of these strawberry DNA extractions about a year ago, and this is what led me onto this bizarre path that I'm going to talk to you right now.
I finally allowed myself to accept what was really most important to me, not what I was conditioned to want or maybe what I conditioned myself to want, and that decision led to a reassessment of the feminist narrative that I grew up with and have always championed.
They're patching together care arrangements that are inadequate and often actually unsafe.
The feminist revolution still has a long way to go.
The revolution for human equality can happen.
It is happening.
And it's really easy to see where innovation's going on.
It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands.
The biggest penis in the animal kingdom, however, is not that of the tapir.
We've also seen a titillation strategy Now unfortunately, in the animal kingdom, it's the coercion strategy that we see time and time again.
I'd like you to imagine this place.
Instead of psychopaths, I studied mice, because the same pattern of brain responses appears across many different species of social animals.
So we started a program in 2007.
So this picture, I think, says it all.
After all, you pointed out that reason is just a means to an end, and the end depends on the reasoner's passions.
RNG: I'm all for empathy. I mean, who isn't?
But all on its own, it's a feeble instrument for making moral progress.
Cesare Beccaria: As punishments become more cruel, the minds of men, which like fluids always adjust to the level of the objects that surround them, become hardened, and after a hundred years of cruel punishments, breaking on the wheel causes no more fear than imprisonment previously did.
RNG: No doubt, but modern anti-war movements reach back to a long chain of thinkers who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize our emotions against war, such as the father of modernity, Erasmus.
SP: But everyone knows that the movement to abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion.
He argued that it was inconsistent with the principles of rational government.
SP: Still, I have become convinced that reason is a better angel that deserves the greatest credit for the moral progress our species has enjoyed and that holds out the greatest hope for continuing moral progress in the future.
Now anonymous companies are great for sanctions busting too.
Campaign groups from around the world have come together to work on this issue.
And then about three and a half minutes before launch, the huge nozzles on the back, like the size of big church bells, swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle, like the vehicle is alive underneath you, like an elephant getting up off its knees or something.
How do you deal with fear versus danger?
And you're holding on with one hand, looking at the world turn beside you.
So if you actually do the research, you find out that in the world there are about 50,000 different types of spiders, and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of 50,000.
And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters here in B.C., there's about 720, 730 different types of spiders and there's one -- one -- that is venomous, and its venom isn't even fatal, it's just kind of like a nasty sting.
And that spider -- not only that, but that spider has beautiful markings on it, it's like "I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation symbol on my back, it's the black widow."
Spider webs like this, it doesn't build those, it builds them down in the corners.
How do you change your behavior?
But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming, like you would if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite back to Earth --  -- instead, 20 years previously we had started studying Russian, and then once you learn Russian, then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian, and then we learned vehicle control theory, and then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again.
Touchdown -- 3:14 and 48 seconds, a.m. Central Time.
Just to finish, they asked me to play that guitar.
I mean, describe to us this Bullrun program where it's alleged that the NSA specifically weakened security in order to get the type of access that you've spoken of.
RL: So there are, when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before, use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology, and they do, because it's a great system, it's the most complex system ever devised by man, and it is a wonder, and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that, and it's just a wonderful thing.
And so we make recommendations on standards to use, and we use those same standards, and so we are invested in making sure that those communications are secure for their intended purposes.
And I think this is partly where there is such a divide of opinion, that there's a lot of people in this room and around the world who think very differently about the Internet.
They think of it as a momentous invention of humanity, kind of on a par with the Gutenberg press, for example.
It's the bringer of knowledge to all.
It's the connector of all.
Can you understand that from that viewpoint, it feels outrageous?
RL: I do understand that, and I actually share the view of the utility of the Internet, and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet.
As a freelance journalist, I sympathize.
The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body, but it also does other things.
Its ultimate destination is this, the greater flamingo.
This cricket swallowed the larvae of a Gordian worm, or horsehair worm.
This cricket swallowed the larvae of a Gordian worm, or horsehair worm.
The worm grew to adult size within it, but it needs to get into water in order to mate, and it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket's brain, causing it to behave erratically.
No.
Now, the caterpillar didn't die.
Manipulation is not an oddity.
Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal found that the venom is a very specific chemical weapon.
It doesn't kill the roach, nor does it sedate it.
Now I would argue that, once stung, the cockroach isn't a roach anymore.
This is Toxoplasma gondii, or Toxo, for short, because the terrifying creature always deserves a cute nickname.
And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse, it turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile.
This has no nervous system.
It has no consciousness.
It doesn't even have a body.
In our home, art was everywhere.
On one particularly hot summer day, we visited a drum-shaped building that from the outside was not particularly interesting.
My dad said it was called the Pantheon, a temple for all of the gods.
It was very dark, the only source of light being an big open hole in the roof.
I'd seen these before, and Bucky was friends with my dad.
I loved this place.
But no amount of brute force gets you the dome of the Pantheon, not 2,000 years ago, nor today.
I also realized that I wasn't the first person to think that this place was really special.
The Internet isn't a Pantheon.
We need to encourage them to work hard and help them understand that failure is a necessary ingredient for success, as is perseverance.
Back to my account, again exhibiting classic behavior.
This is an insight at the core of intelligence.
Fourteen billion light years that way and 14 billion light years that way, it's the same temperature.
What happens? It rings.
One of the first spaces that I studied was this little vest pocket park called Paley Park in midtown Manhattan.
This little space became a small phenomenon, and because it had such a profound impact on New Yorkers, it made an enormous impression on me.
I saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail.
The first opportunity I had to fight for a great public open space was in the early 1980s, when I was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City in lower Manhattan on the Hudson River.
But in any case, it took nine months of nonstop daily negotiation to finally get the signed agreement to prohibit its demolition, and that was only two years ago.
When a dragonfly flutters by, you may not realize, but it's the greatest flier in nature.
But that only made a parent's role more confusing in a way.
When asked about this by The New York Times, a producer for the show gave a variety of explanations.
So to see the planet, we have to do something about all of that light.
The moon has moved in front of the sun.
The moon has moved in front of the sun.
Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space.
In much of the world, it's completely inescapable.
I've got to take that slide off.
In Helvetica Compressed, Extra Compressed, and Ultra Compressed, this rigid 18-unit system really boxed me in.
My instinct tells you that any improvement would be rather slight, because they were designed as functions of the system they were designed to fit, and as I said, type is very adaptable.
He said he was conscious of working within constraints, but not of making compromises.
The phone book. I'll hold the slide so you can enjoy the nostalgia.
And look, as economical in data as a sans serif.
I had really misunderstood the technology.
So did my typeface.
How many inventors and untold entrepreneurs live out this phenomenon?
We see it even in the gambling industry that once picked up on this phenomenon of the near win and created these scratch-off tickets that had a higher than average rate of near wins and so compelled people to buy more tickets that they were called heart-stoppers, and were set on a gambling industry set of abuses in Britain in the 1970s.
The reason the near win has a propulsion is because it changes our view of the landscape and puts our goals, which we tend to put at a distance, into more proximate vicinity to where we stand.
And this is what a near win does.
It needs no introduction in part because the Apollo 17 astronauts, when they were hurtling around the moon in 1972, took this iconic image.
It galvanized a whole generation of human beings to realize that we're on Spaceship Earth, fragile and finite as it is, and that we need to take care of it.
And we call this satellite "Dove" — Thank you.
In other words, I had to find a way to make sure that my creativity survived its own success.
And I did, in the end, find that inspiration, but I found it in the most unlikely and unexpected place.
And one of these fates is objectively seen by the world as bad, and the other one is objectively seen by the world as good, but your subconscious is completely incapable of discerning the difference between bad and good.
So here we have an interface where we have physical handles onto a protein, and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways.
And they happen, on average, to have a certain unique physiology: legs that are very long and very thin at their extremity, and this is because they have their ancestry in a very hot and dry climate, and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes.
You can even see it outside your window.
Alan Turing, a pioneer of artificial intelligence, spoke about creating the illusion that a machine could think.
That's "La Di Da Di" and it's the fifth-most sampled song of all time.
It's been sampled 547 times.
It's thoroughly modern Biggie.
A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album that myself and Salaam Remi, the other producer, achieved, how we captured this long-lost sound, but without the very, very 21st-century personality and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore and even a mention of Slick Rick, the whole thing would have run the risk of being very pastiche, to be honest.
So when one ant meets another, it doesn't matter which ant it meets, and they're actually not transmitting any kind of complicated signal or message.
An outgoing forager doesn't go out unless it gets enough interactions with returning foragers, and what you see are the returning foragers going into the tunnel, into the nest, and meeting outgoing foragers on their way out.
So just as a neuron adds up its stimulation from other neurons to decide whether to fire, an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants to decide whether to forage.
This is a map of the study site where I have been tracking this population of harvester ant colonies for 28 years, which is about as long as a colony lives.
Those are the little ones running around with their abdomens up in the air.
When there's one piece of fruit, there's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby, and the ants that specialize on clustered resources use interactions for recruitment.
There are inherent benefits to this.
The hour for those past thirty..."
A Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe.
Instead, L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress classification system, including page numbers, to leave me clues.
If you look at how much fish protein you get per dollar invested compared to all of the other animal proteins, obviously, fish is a good business decision.
It uses a lot less fresh water than, for example, cattle, where you have to irrigate a field so that you can grow the food to graze the cattle.
It takes a little bit of fuel, but as you know, agriculture can have a carbon footprint, and fish has a much smaller one, so it's less polluting.
What were you eating?
That moment changed my life.
I've sometimes wondered whether I could have ceased to hate that part of myself without gay pride's technicolor fiesta, of which this speech is one manifestation.
The gay activist Harvey Milk was once asked by a younger gay man what he could do to help the movement, and Harvey Milk said, "Go out and tell someone."
♪ Get this through your head, I'm nothing like you ♪ ♪ I'm done with all the arguments, there'll be no more disputes ♪ ♪ And you'll die before you see me in your dead man's boots ♪  Thank you.
This is a big deal.
I want a life that's out of the ordinary.
I'm going to start out on that little route to begin with.
I think the answer is a pretty simple one and therefore crude and contentious.
And that list was essentially constructed.
Here's another problem, I think. A very specific thing happened.
Here's three values. Everybody here holds all of them, but you probably know that as you grow, as you age, the balance of these values shifts.
Here's what we found.
The bottom line is, time is a powerful force.
It transforms our preferences.
It reshapes our values.
[A. E. Housman] Now, this poem has appealed to science fiction writers.
It's furnished at least three science fiction titles, I think because it says poems can brings us news from the future or the past or across the world, because their patterns can seem to tell you what's in somebody's heart.
A few years on Earth become one speech, one breath.
Now, this next poem really changed what I liked and what I read and what I felt I could read as an adult.
Now, this next poem really changed what I liked and what I read and what I felt I could read as an adult.
I just heard that there were these scandalous writers called Language poets who didn't make any sense, and I wanted to go and see for myself what they were like, and some of them didn't do much for me, but this writer, Rae Armantrout, did an awful lot, and I kept reading her until I felt I knew what was going on, as I do with this poem.
It's about the Garden of Eden and the Fall and the Biblical story of the Fall, in which sex as we know it and death and guilt come into the world at the same time.
someone else from long ago, someone quite memorable.

This is the foot of a cockroach.
You see these plates, and you see the compliant membrane.
Rather than the fixed behaviors it could invent new behaviors.
We call it the Cretaceous extinction event.
And mammals got bigger, their brains got bigger at an even faster pace, and the neocortex got bigger even faster than that and developed these distinctive ridges and folds basically to increase its surface area.
The E recognizers will lower their threshold and they see some sloppy thing, could be an E.
And these movements have been incredibly effective and popular, so in 1985, their opponents made up a new word, to shift how we view them.
Now most people never even heard about this law, including members of Congress.

Indeed, many hackers do not resist those temptations, and so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year to fraud, malware or plain old identity theft, which is a serious issue.
He reported it to the company, of course, but they ignored his report.
Frustrated with the exchange, he took to use his own discovery to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall.
This is when Anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of Internet dwellers.

They can bring people together.
Hackers represent an exceptional force for change This is because access to information is a critical currency of power, one which governments would like to control, a thing they attempt to do by setting up all-you-can-eat surveillance programs, a thing they need hackers for, by the way.
Those are the questions I want to talk about today.
What I'm saying is, we should be less quick to decide that that change is terrible, we should be less quick to impose our likes and dislikes about words on other people, and we should be entirely reluctant to think that the English language is in trouble.
I hope that what you can do is find language change not worrisome but fun and fascinating, just the way dictionary editors do.
So how does a word get into a dictionary?
So how does a word get into a dictionary?
Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource, but there is no objective dictionary authority out there that is the final arbiter about what words mean.
Not necessarily.
A higher salary makes the banking job better than it was before, but it might not be enough to make being a banker better than being an artist.
I am for chocolate donuts.
This response in hard choices is a rational response, but it's not dictated by reasons given to us.
And so, I abandoned my dream life for a single room on the backstreets of Kyoto, Japan, which was the place that had long exerted a strong, really mysterious gravitational pull on me.
And when life throws up one of its nasty surprises, as it will, more than once, when a doctor comes into my room wearing a grave expression, or a car suddenly veers in front of mine on the freeway, I know, in my bones, that it's the time I've spent going nowhere that is going to sustain me much more than all the time I've spent racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island.
who take the time and trouble to sit still.
And the reason I speak a composite version of your language Is because mines was raped away along with my history I speak broken English so the profusing gashes can remind us That our current state is not a mystery I’m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people mad So unless you’ve seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair bad I’m so sick of this nonsensical racial disparity
No, we just asked them about their password.
How long is it? Does it have a digit?
So we did this, and we collected 5,000 passwords, and we gave people a bunch of different policies to create passwords with.
So what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using, or that we could find information about in the research literature.
So what we decided to do was to see how long it would take to crack these passwords using the best cracking tools that the bad guys are using, or that we could find information about in the research literature.
So this was an xkcd cartoon from a couple of years ago, and the cartoonist suggests that we should all use pass phrases, and if you look at the second row of this cartoon, you can see the cartoonist is suggesting that the pass phrase "correct horse battery staple" would be a very strong pass phrase and something really easy to remember.
One of the things that I did is I made a number of quilts, and I made this quilt here.
It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably.

Twenty or 30 years ago, if a chicken caught a cold and sneezed and died in a remote village in East Asia, it would have been a tragedy for the chicken and its closest relatives, but I don't think there was much possibility of us fearing a global pandemic and the deaths of millions.
But if I had to put it in a nutshell these days, I sort of feel that globalization has taken us by surprise, and we've been slow to respond to it.
Are we and our politicians to a degree cultural psychopaths?
If, on the other hand, you have a country with a very weak or a very negative image, everything is difficult and everything is expensive.

over the last decades building their own economy, building their own society and their own polity, but it is to be hoped that the second phase of their growth will be somewhat more outward-looking than the first phase has been so far.
Now that's the Good Country Index.
That word, "good," and the number 6.8 and the discovery that's behind it have changed my life.
I've started thinking very differently about my own country since I've been thinking about these things.
He was the one that suffered the most under those conditions of imprisonment, and yet he understood American democracy.
It was a battle for the Gothic Line.
They were change agents, and they left for me a legacy.
On January 26, 1997, Amel boarded the bus in Algiers where she was studying to go home and spend a Ramadan evening with her family, and would never finish law school.
The loss of such a young woman is unfathomable, and so as I did my research I found myself searching for Amel's hope again and her name even means "hope" in Arabic.
She said, "I'm turning 40 at the end of this year, and I've been so bad in choosing men in my life."
In regard to ecological crisis, we think nothing needs to be done just now, or others need to act before us.
Or, a question for me is also, why would people who have no health insurance not embrace universal healthcare?
I also embrace the idea that we should go beyond thinking about individual choices, that it's very important to rethink social choices, since this ideology of individual choice has pacified us.
But there is a trade-off, because these incisions are created with a long, pointed device called a trocar.
And now the reason why everyone in the operating room was staring at that device on that day was because he had to be absolutely careful not to plunge it through and puncture it into the organs and blood vessels below.
Remember this?
I want to show it to you again, a little closer up.
That happens within four 100ths of a second after puncture.
I worked on this because this problem really fascinated me.
It kept me up at night.
We have to be better at finding those problems and finding ways to solve them.
I also liked to make devices that work with body parts.
I would cut out the light sensor, add an extension line, and use modeling clay, stick it onto the television, and then I would videotape my eye, and using the dark part of my eye tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time, so you turn on the lightbulb.
It's a mold with an identity crisis, because it's not a mold, so let's get that straight to start with.
So within a slime mold you might find thousands or millions of nuclei, all sharing a cell wall, all operating as one entity.
A microbiologist friend of mine gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it and told me to go home and play with it.
I've worked with plants, bacteria, cuttlefish, fruit flies.
So I was keen to get my new collaborator home to see what it could do.
So I took it home and I watched.
I fed it a varied diet.
I observed as it networked.
It formed a connection between food sources.
I watched it leave a trail behind it, indicating where it had been.
For instance, having fed on a nice pile of oats, the slime mold goes off to explore new territories in different directions simultaneously.
However, at the next interval, the researchers didn't put the cold air on, yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation of it happening.
A third experiment: the slime mold was invited to explore a territory covered in oats.
It fans out in a branching pattern.
As it goes, each food node it finds, it forms a network, a connection to, and keeps foraging.
After 26 hours, it established quite a firm network between the different oats.
It is a biological computer.
As such, it has been mathematically modeled, algorithmically analyzed.
So the question is, how does this thing work?
It doesn't have a central nervous system.
It doesn't have a brain, yet it can perform behaviors that we associate with brain function.
So this is a microscopy, a video I shot, and it's about 100 times magnification, sped up about 20 times, and inside the slime mold, there is a rhythmic pulsing flow, a vein-like structure carrying cellular material, nutrients and chemical information through the cell, streaming first in one direction and then back in another.
Other public engagement activities, I run lots of slime mold workshops, a creative way of engaging with the organism.
But they weren't as efficient as the slime mold, and the slime mold, for me, is a fascinating subject matter.
And the slime mold is also my working material.
Whilst the slime mold doesn't choose to work with me, exactly, it is a collaboration of sorts.
Whilst the slime mold doesn't choose to work with me, exactly, it is a collaboration of sorts.
The slime mold has the final say in the creative process.
Look how we do it.
It's a process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell.
Through connections with a membrane, clathrin is able to deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle, that's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell.
I believe that animation can change biology.
I have a problem.
Which is why before I sing, I wanted to tell you what singing means to me.
It's more than making nice sounds, and it's more than making nice songs.
It's more than feeling known, or understood.
Silence is the residue of fear.
Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina.
It is the sound after the noose is already tied.
Those sorts of things are not, they're not out there, and in fact they've acquired a certain amount of privacy.
We love the fact that the web is open.
A thank you can change a life.
A thank you can change a life.
Instead, what we proposed is to make the plaza entirely pedestrian, to cover it with recycled leather canopies, and to connect it to the banks of the river.
The second site of intervention is also an urban void along the river banks, and it used to be an illegal parking, and we proposed to transform it into the first playground in the medina.
And recently, I did a reading in California, and a woman raised her hand after the talk and she said, "Dr. Braitman, I think my cat has PTSD."
Indeed, they probably won't.
But are there conceivable events that could be even worse, events that could snuff out all life?
Now, late that evening, the report went viral.
It was on news channels across the world.
Everyone was discussing it.
So that night, as I sat wondering how I should respond, I found myself filled with doubt.
But the thing is, empowerment is an emotion.
But the universe is anything but static.
And this camera will image the sky, taking a new picture every 20 seconds, constantly scanning the sky so every three nights, we'll get a completely new view of the skies above Chile.
And the observations were simple: just 24 galaxies and a hand-drawn picture.
So what is the next revolution likely to be?
People, of course, places, and the boundless energy of my youth, and I'm beginning to lose independence, and that scares me.
I'm aware that before, death was in the neighborhood.
Why is there — Okay. Okay.  This is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn.
It was towards the end of the 17th century, the philosopher Leibniz who asked it, a very smart guy, Leibniz, who invented the calculus independently of Isaac Newton, at about the same time, but for Leibniz, who asked why is there something rather than nothing, this was not a great mystery.
And by the way, this is what most Americans today believe.
And we think there's a lot of something out there but that's because we're enslaved by our desires.
The laws of quantum field theory for him are like fiat lux, "Let there be light."
Don't believe him.  It's a pious hope, I wish it were true, but I think the other day he admitted to me it's really an ugly universe.
It's a stick and bubble gum contraption.
Anyway, so between nothingness and the fullest possible reality, various special realities.
The deity isn't all-good and all-powerful.
The goal in my life has always been to make more and more products in the least amount of time and resources.
For over a decade as a doctor, I've cared for homeless veterans, for working-class families.
And where health begins is not in the four walls of a doctor's office, but where we live and where we work, where we eat, sleep, learn and play, where we spend the majority of our lives.
The emergency room doctors said, "We've run some tests, Veronica.
Turns out, Veronica said yes to three of those things: roaches, water leaks, mold.
Let's say there was a company, a tech startup that came to you and said, "We have a great product.
then doctor, are you willing to listen?
We can all invest in making sure that we improve the allocation of resources upstream, but at the same time work together and show that we can move healthcare upstream.
This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces actually happens to people.
That's my nose over on the right, and now we're going over here, right there.
When I got out of the scanner, I did a quick analysis of the data, looking for any parts of my brain that produced a higher response when I was looking at faces than when I was looking at objects, and here's what I saw.
Now this image looks just awful by today's standards, but at the time I thought it was beautiful.
So the next question was, what does this thing really do?
Well, maybe not, right?
Maybe it responds not only to faces but to any body part.
So that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there.
But importantly, I don't think we have for every important mental function, even mental functions that may be critical for survival.
To address questions like that, scientists are now scanning other species of animals, and they're also scanning human infants.
Extreme poverty — not having enough food for the day.
You are invited to media conferences.
Everybody answered that question, "Yeah, I drive cars better."
Okay, this was good evolutionarily, but now when it comes to the worldview, it is the exact reason why it's upside down.
Okay, this little shortlist, what are we going to do with it?
That's nice. So what's going to happen next?
And so Riley was like, "That will never happen.
She was right in that place in the middle, that place which you could call art or fiction.
This is the first book that I ever made.
It's called "Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem."
And it's about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet but it's a punishment and it ruins his life.
Like most other people, I moved around Beijing by bicycle.
Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels.
Over the next 20 years, perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so.
But we're already seeing that we can do so much about that.
In 1908, on the island of Crete, archaeologists discovered a clay disc.
In 1908, on the island of Crete, archaeologists discovered a clay disc.
You know that somewhere, probably in a telecommunications carrier's database, there is a spreadsheet or at least a database entry that records your information of where you've been at all times.
And then Arthur Samuel leaves the computer to play itself.
It plays itself. It collects more data.
It collects more data. It increases the accuracy of its prediction.
Machine learning is at the basis of many of the things that we do online: search engines, Amazon's personalization algorithm, computer translation, voice recognition systems.
We now need to recast our gaze at the I, the information, which is less apparent, but in some ways a lot more important.
I've been a first responder in a number of incidents ranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy.
Regardless of religious belief or cultural background, there's a need for forgiveness.
And this is not just a piece of trivia, but it's really important to understand and solve the sanitation problem.
And there are 1.1 billion people whose toilets are the streets or river banks or open spaces, and again, the technical term for that is open defecation, but that is really simply shitting in the open.
And if you're living in fecal material and it's surrounding you, you're going to get sick.
And is this really the solution?
They not only went to work back home, but they organized their communities to build Honduras' first indigenous hospital.
These skills and competencies can be summarized as business, strategic, and financial acumen.
And then they pretty much stopped.
And then they pretty much stopped.
This doesn't mean that this advice is unimportant.
So for 63 percent of organizations, achieving their strategic financial goals is questionable.
It's important for directors on boards to expect from their executives proportional pools of women when they sit down once a year for their succession discussions.
I check and —  I check that email account religiously all the time.
There are dozens of psychological studies that prove that when somebody knows that they might be watched, the behavior they engage in is vastly more conformist and compliant.
Even if you're somebody who decides that you never want to, the fact that there are other people who are willing to and able to resist and be adversarial to those in power — dissidents and journalists and activists and a whole range of others — is something that brings us all collective good that we should want to preserve.
But the most important reason is that a system of mass surveillance suppresses our own freedom in all sorts of ways.
The renowned socialist activist Rosa Luxemburg once said, "He who does not move does not notice his chains."
Amongst our members is this adorable little girl, Bia, to your right, and Bia was just 11 years old when she started a campaign using one of our tools to save her model public school from demolition.
Well, in Mayank's family, soap is used for bathing, soap is used for laundry, soap is used for washing dishes.
His parents think sometimes it's a precious commodity, so they'll keep it in a cupboard.
Last week, I was in Ghana with the minister of health, because if you don't know, there's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment.
To explain what microRNAs are and their important role in cancer, I need to start with proteins, because when cancer is present in our body, protein modification is observed in all cancerous cells.
And that is what makes microRNAs such a promising biomarker for cancer, because as you know, cancer is a disease of altered gene expression.
Another important thing to consider is that no two cancers are the same, but at the microRNA level, there are patterns.
Let me do a demonstration.
If we can have a camera here so you can see my screen.
A smartphone is a connected computer and it's also a camera, good enough for our purpose.
We cannot lose the war against cancer.
I want to see the day when cancer is treated easily because it can be routinely diagnosed at the very early stages, and I'm certain that in the very near future, because of this and other breakthroughs that we are seeing every day in the life sciences, the way we see cancer will radically change.
Technology has brought us so much: the moon landing, the Internet, the ability to sequence the human genome.
And the Health Media Collaboratory respected the limits of their data, but they were able to conclude that those advertisements — and you may have seen them — into a thought process that may have an impact on future behavior.
My son Isaac, when he was two, was diagnosed with autism, and he was this happy, hilarious, loving, affectionate little guy, but the metrics on his developmental evaluations, which looked at things like the number of words — at that point, none — communicative gestures and minimal eye contact, put his developmental level at that of a nine-month-old baby.
And so what we need to do instead is spend a little bit more time on things like the humanities and sociology, and the social sciences, rhetoric, philosophy, ethics, because they give us context that is so important for big data, and because they help us become better critical thinkers.
Everything was different.
But if you become the president of Zimbabwe, and you say, "You know, I really like this job.
Every year we give out 10 prizes.
And that's where the idea came from.
And that's where the idea came from.
Maybe you've heard of her.
Maybe you've heard of her.
Even being able to commune with animals that are much larger than us, such as this endangered goliath grouper who only still resides in the Florida Keys.
You can see the silky bubble come out of our hard hats.
Now, using a cutting-edge piece of technology that's not really meant for the oceans is not always easy.
There were massive irregularities reported, and people came out to protest, which was very unlikely for Russia.
So for this image, they flew a camera, a five kilogram device with an SLR under it.
Well, let me see, it's a quadrocopter, but what's kind of special about it is there's a leash.
It's literally a dog leash. It's very convenient.
But no matter what, this thing will actually prevent this thing from going into you.
What's more, it tells you immediately that I am the one responsible for this device.
My mother and I can be competitive —  — but I was really not trying to compete with her on this one.
And that's when I told myself, claim your experience.
Claim your experience.
Claim your experience.
We have to let that old story go so that a new story, a truer story, can be told.
Claim your experience. Don't let it claim you.
Four years before the trees, we were approached by the government to help them come up with a communications strategy to get as many guerrillas as we could out of the jungle.
But we didn't know very much about it.
I don't know if they're together now, but I can find out.  But what I can tell you is that our radio strategy was working.
The problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla.
Our design was something in between a building and a house.
Well, how does that building look, typically?
Alejandro Aravena: I don't know if you were able to read the subtitles, but you can tell from the body language that participatory design is not a hippie, romantic, kind of thing.
In addition, we are in the middle of the forest region of the country, and our public space sucks.
So we thought that we had to produce a third alternative, and our approach was against geographical threats, have geographical answers.
So be it the force of self construction, the force of common sense, or the force of nature, all these forces need to be translated into form, and what that form is modeling and shaping is not cement, bricks, or wood.
And what we really need to do is to bring the underground drug markets as much as possible aboveground and regulate them as intelligently as we can to minimize both the harms of drugs and the harms of prohibitionist policies.
Will more people use marijuana?
So the challenges we face today The first is the policy challenge of designing and implementing alternatives to ineffective prohibitionist policies, even as we need to get better at regulating and living with the drugs that are now legal.
How do you break the barrier when you show up with a lens?
BG: So it was one of your first ones in Brazil.
That small scratch became infected.
Second day, he was doing much better.
So I don't know where you live, but wherever it is, it certainly is a lot worse now than it was in 1999, and that is the problem of antibiotic resistance.
If you look at the price of penicillin, the cost per day is about 10 cents.
She went through surgery and radiation, and was on her third round of chemotherapy when she lost her address book.
A couple of weeks after I put that online, 500,000 people in dozens of countries, I mean dozens of countries, watched this video.
In fact, the cure for MAS is right here in our hands.
Which, if I remember my high school Spanish, means something like, "Enough already, make it stop!"
Now, this problem is not only a huge problem for the military, but it's also a huge problem that's epidemic throughout the entire medical field, which is how do we actually look at wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body?
So now, the ECM is actually this mesh that holds the cells in place, provides structure for your tissues, but it also gives the cells a home.
So if you have a bleeding wound like the one behind me, you can actually put our material onto this, and just like Lego blocks, it'll reassemble into the local tissue.
So if you have a bleeding wound like the one behind me, you can actually put our material onto this, and just like Lego blocks, it'll reassemble into the local tissue.
So now, this type of bleed is incredibly traumatic, and like I said before, would actually take five minutes or more with pressure to be able to stop.
So now this technology — Thank you.
He looked me in the face and he said, "Take off your shoe and give me your machete."
The pain disappeared for seven months.
There's a saying in Suriname that I dearly love: "The rainforests hold answers to questions we have yet to ask."
Top half wonder drugs, bottom half just a bunch of skinny-ass cows.
This, in the past, is why you didn't mess with isolated Indians.
Using automatic weapons to slaughter uncontacted peoples is the single most despicable and disgusting human rights abuse on our planet today, and it has to stop.
The process is old-fashioned.
TH: And now we thought, yes, we have a brilliant program.
It will fit for the 2,000 train spotters in Norway.
It's the other strong memory.
It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen.
Yes, we took a conference room on board the Hurtigruten.
TH: Another camera is this one. It's normally used for sports.
And Slow TV was now a buzzword, and we started looking for other things we could make Slow TV about.
This is from last summer, and as a TV producer, it's a nice picture, but now you can cut to the next one.
This is from last summer, and as a TV producer, it's a nice picture, but now you can cut to the next one.
And where is that cow going?
So we think that Slow TV is one nice way of telling a TV story, and we think that we can continue doing it, not too often, once or twice a year, so we keep the feeling of an event, and we also think that the good Slow TV idea, that's the idea when people say, "Oh no, you can't put that on TV."
Why is it okay that the government is keeping all of this information?
Just as the police in Ferguson possess high-tech military weapons and equipment, so too do police departments across the United States possess high-tech surveillance gear.
Just as the police in Ferguson possess high-tech military weapons and equipment, so too do police departments across the United States possess high-tech surveillance gear.
And so it leads to things like this.
Okay, so Top Tip #1: How to win at online dating.
I received a letter recently from a 13-year-old boy.
That rule lives in your brain.
Another way to make words in English is back-formation.
Tourism is one of them, but also media and education, and you might be wondering, really, can tourism change things?
It means "upside-down."
You cook it with rice and chicken, and you flip it upside-down.
To find my way, I used my phone.
I remember a verse by a tremendous poet, a great poet, from our Unit 48 workshop, Nicolás Dorado: "I will need an infinite thread to sew up this huge wound."
Poetry does that; it sews up the wounds of exclusion.
But you don't know how much I'd like it if you could feel, live, experience, even for a few seconds, what I enjoy every week and what makes me who I am.
And these are skeletons by now, most of these crimes happened 32 years ago.
And if you have more consideration for others, you are not going to ransack that planet that we have and at the current rate, we don't have three planets to continue that way.
So is individual change possible?
This video is from UC Berkeley.
That's almost 100 times its own length.
That's almost 100 times its own length.
And in this case, instead of magnets or muscles to move this around, we use rockets.
So you have this 300-milligram robot jumping about eight centimeters in the air.
And despite that, a Scot and a Brazilian persevered, because that's how we were raised in our respective countries, and for 12, 15 years, we made demonstration after demonstration suggesting that this was possible.
So this is just one experiment that we published a few years ago, where a monkey, without moving its body, learned to control the movements of an avatar arm, a virtual arm that doesn't exist.
We reenacted this paper.
So he walks, and at the end of the walk -- I am running out of time already -- he says, "You know, guys, I need to borrow this thing from you when I get married, because I wanted to walk to the priest and see my bride and actually be there by myself.
Basically, the blue lights pulsating indicate that the exo is ready to go.
So let's connect all this together.
So what we found out is that when one monkey starts slacking down, the other two monkeys enhance their performance to get the guy to come back, so this adjusts dynamically, but the global synchrony remains the same.
It is very fashionable and proper to speak about food in all its forms, all its colors, aromas and tastes.
From the toilet, the muck comes into the first leach pit.
This is in a village where most of the people are even illiterate.
It's a conflict that rarely hits the headlines.
The Congolese conflict is the deadliest conflict since World War II.
It has caused almost four million deaths.
So what I mean is that Western and African diplomats, United Nations peacekeepers, donors, the staff of most nongovernmental organizations that work with the resolution of conflict, they all share a specific way of seeing the world.
So the idea is that listening to Mozart makes you smarter and improves your performance on I.Q. tests.
The myth here is that sportsmen go through hot-hand streaks, Americans call them, or purple patches, we sometimes say in England, where they just can't miss, like this guy here.
Integrating these components, I was able to successfully create two prototypes, one in which the sensor is embedded inside a sock, and another that's a re-attachable sensor assembly that can be adhered anywhere that makes contact with the bottom of the patient's foot.
Loneliness creates a deep psychological wound, one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking.
There is a lot of research on loneliness, and all of it is horrifying.
Loneliness causes high blood pressure, high cholesterol.
One little girl tried pulling the purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back and looked at the box, with her lower lip trembling.
You have to gain control over the situation.
And it's interesting that we do, because our self-esteem is already hurting.
We know from dozens of studies that when your self-esteem is lower, you are more vulnerable to stress and to anxiety, that failures and rejections hurt more and it takes longer to recover from them.
That's the best way.
Take the ancient Egyptians, for example: very concerned about the body parts they thought they'd need in the afterlife, but they left some parts out. This part, for example.
It's actually singing to each other over a great distance.
But in fact, this is the little-known fact that I didn't realize at the time: Deforestation accounts for more greenhouse gas than all of the world's planes, trains, cars, trucks and ships combined.
It looks super high tech.
So in fact what we have now is a system where we can use people on the ground, people who are already there, who can both improve and use the existing connectivity, and we're using old cell phones that are being sent to us by people from around the world that want their phones to be doing something else in their afterlife, And if the rest of the device can be completely recycled,
Unfortunately, today, when we actually send an email, we're not sending a letter.
Unfortunately, today, when we actually send an email, we're not sending a letter.
So these companies aren't going to give us our privacy.
So here we have Bob and Alice, who want to communicate privately.
So the key challenge is to take Bob's message and to get it to Alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message.
So the key challenge is to take Bob's message and to get it to Alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message.
The reality is much more complex and it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this.
Now sir, you have the giraffe.
But what if we decided to search for those amazing things, for those small coincidences in life that are truly amazing?
Let's make sure you have it.
So you get this kind of big square, okay?
Now not only that, I want you to take the paper clip and put it around the bill.
Can we make a hat into a toy?
This is called "59."
She said: “All the darkness in the world cannot put out the light from a single candle So how the hell can they handle your light?
It's just a really great building.
It has these courtyards in the middle so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air, and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings, so they just feel more comfortable to be in.
It was the first time the story of Stonewall had been told to a national audience.
Josh Littman: From a scale of one to 10, do you think your life would be different without animals?
And I couldn't really face that, so I started to challenge the conventions of the time, even to the extent of changing my name from "Stephanie" to "Steve" so as to get through the door before anyone realized that he was a she.
When I started my company of women, the men said, "How interesting, because it only works because it's small."
If success were easy, we'd all be millionaires.
So it's just as well that I'm a workaholic.
When Japan then invaded China in the 1930s the world looked away and was indifferent to what would happen to China.
The U.S. and the West say China cheats on the question of intellectual property rights, and through cyberattacks on U.S. and global firms.
And this was great, and I saw people having an even deeper emotional reaction to this than the things that I had made in rectangles.
If you remember John Rawls, he had this notion of what's a just society.
It is really difficult to live a life with an uncertain fate, in limbo.
And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn't want to stay in the room, we let him go.
What I'm going to do now is just play some examples of real human beings laughing, and in fact how primitive laughter is as a sound.
In fact, you find laughter throughout the mammals.
That's the same for humans.
You find it associated with play, and all mammals play.
Or if he was running around with a visibly broken leg laughing, and his friends are going, "Heinrich, I think we need to go to the hospital now," that also wouldn't be funny.
We've got to make all this violence against the poor illegal.
So you're going to squeeze.
This fascinating universe of bacteria inside of us is an integral part of our health, and our technology is evolving so rapidly that today we can program these bacteria like we program computers.
Now, our genetic program relies on a natural phenomenon called quorum sensing, in which bacteria trigger coordinated and sometimes virulent behaviors once they reach a critical density.
Our genetic program continues producing these rhythmic patterns of fluorescent proteins as the colony grows outwards.
I would set off the distress signal, but quite frankly, I don't think they'd ever be able to find this little boat.
The phone is ringing, her friends are calling, but she doesn't know how to talk to them.
And to say it like that makes it sound like we're manipulating and exploiting bees, and the truth is, we've been doing that for thousands of years.
This is a six-story bespoke home on the island of Bali.
It turns bamboo into a viable building material.
How could you make a door better?
Let me tell you, sometimes I dream of sheet rock and plywood.
Happy 50th anniversary on your flag, Canada.
Narrator: Number one, keep it simple.
RM: The design of the Chicago flag has complete buy-in with an entire cross-section of the city.
TK: A positive feedback loop there between great symbolism and civic pride.
RM: Okay. So when I moved back to San Francisco in 2008, I researched its flag, because I had never seen it in the previous eight years I lived there.
RM: I still don't really dig the phoenix.
Rather than plopping the whole coat of arms on a solid background and writing "Amsterdam" below it, they just take the key elements of the escutcheon, the shield, and they turn it into the most badass city flag in the world.
TK: I like to say that in every bad flag there's a good flag trying to get out.  The way to make San Francisco's flag a good flag is to take the motto off because you can't read that at a distance.
Take the name off, and the border might even be made thicker, so it's more a part of the flag.
In my crusade to make flags of the world more beautiful, many listeners have taken it upon themselves to redesign their flags and look into the feasibility of getting them officially adopted.
In my crusade to make flags of the world more beautiful, many listeners have taken it upon themselves to redesign their flags and look into the feasibility of getting them officially adopted.
I don't care.
I'd like to have you look at this pencil.
There were a series of hearings over the next six months.
Now, when it comes to pain, psychologist Brock Bastian probably said it best when he wrote, "Pain is a kind of shortcut to mindfulness.
It makes us suddenly aware of everything in the environment.
I actually started first grade with a big cast all over my torso.
Tom Rielly: So Cosmin, tell me what hardware is this that they're rapidly putting away?
This planet, we know the mass and the size and it has a fairly low density.
Let me show you another example now, this time about a problem of causal reasoning.
I am then going to try twice and fail both times, and then Hyowon is going to try again and succeed, and this roughly sums up my relationship to my graduate students in technology across the board.
We created a deployment plan that specified where every single support person and police officer would be every minute of the day, and we monitored at every second of the day, and, our best invention ever, we devised a schoolwide discipline program titled "Non-negotiables."
Called me by a name I did not recognize, said "lesbian," but I was more boy than girl, more Ken than Barbie.
Called me by a name I did not recognize, said "lesbian," but I was more boy than girl, more Ken than Barbie.
She claims I have turned myself into a mausoleum, that I am a walking casket, news headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle, Bruce Jenner on everyone's lips while the brutality of living in this body becomes an asterisk at the bottom of equality pages.
Now, today I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference between patching around the problem with driver assistance systems and actually having fully self-driving cars and what they can do for the world.
I'm also going to talk to you a little bit about our car and allow you to see how it sees the world and how it reacts and what it does, but first I'm going to talk a little bit about the problem.
Well, almost regular -- they were 100 Googlers, but they weren't working on the project.
We tested it a lot, but it could still fail.
And so we gave them two hours of training, we put them in the car, we let them use it, and what we heard back was something awesome, as someone trying to bring a product into the world.
In fact, we had a Porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day, "This is completely stupid. What are we thinking?"
So this was music to our ears, but then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing, and this was eye-opening.
So this was music to our ears, but then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing, and this was eye-opening.
Let me talk about something a little technical for a moment here.
Now, if we look at the bottom left corner here, this is your classic car.
But if we want a self-driving car, we need a technology curve that looks like this.
So this pedestrian here might be stepping into the road, might not be.
So this is our vehicle.
Then we know where the car is in the moment, but we have to do better than that: we have to predict what's going to happen.
Then we know where the car is in the moment, but we have to do better than that: we have to predict what's going to happen.
Knowing that one pickup truck is great, but we really need to know what everybody's thinking, so it becomes quite a complicated problem.
So you can see our car in the middle and the other boxes on the road, driving down the highway.
They won the game. They won the championship.
As a young Muslim woman, I am very proud of my faith.
Now, we have a story about what would happen that we've been told for a century.
That's what I thought.
You can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic.
But here's the fascinating thing: In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water.
They almost never use it.
Addiction in every study is significantly down.
Before these talks began -- you guys know this -- we were told we weren't allowed to have our smartphones on, and I have to say, a lot of you looked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable for the next couple of hours.  A lot of us feel like that, and it might sound weird to say, I've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction
At this date-a-thon event, I saw so many examples of that, but as I watched Stacey's dates and talked to her about them, I realized how different photographic love is from real love.
And so what that means is the katydid males are very choosy about who they offer these nuptial gifts to.
Now, the gift is very nutritious, and the female eats it during and after mating.
But instead, you're forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers.
It was really hard to obtain, because it's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer.
I chose this word, La Cura -- La Cura in Italian means "the cure" -- because in many different cultures, the word "cure" can mean many different things.
For example, here we see Francesca Fini in her performance.
You don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece.
I think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes.
One of the reasons this is so important to me, is because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world.
At the beginning, I was going to write, "[In Arabic]," which means, "In your face," but --  I decided to be smarter and I wrote, "[In Arabic]," which means, "Open your heart."
Today, I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall.
It's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds, because down here at the bottom of the Catskill Mountains, there is a little town called Roscoe -- actually, this will go easier if I just put it up here -- There's Roscoe, and then right above Roscoe is Rockland, New York, and then right above that is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.
And so I started to learn, because learning was cool.
As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally.
The Higgs field in turn plays an integral role in our model for the weak nuclear force.
Or, here's Honey Boo Boo criticizing industrial capitalism: ["Liberal capitalism is not at all the Good of humanity.
There's an envelope.
A mountain is an objective reality.
Yet, what is money?
But then came along these master storytellers -- the big bankers, the finance ministers, the prime ministers -- and they tell us a very convincing story: "Look, you see this green piece of paper?
What do you think I am, a human?
When you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology, you have no way of controlling who's going to go through it.
But it's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments -- in biochemistry labs, using spectroscopy -- have shown very clear, firm evidence that there are certain specific mechanisms that require quantum mechanics to explain them.
If we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics, then, as the fundamental foundation of reality itself, quantum physics underpins organic chemistry.
I don't blame the biologists for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics.
It was tremendously influential.
Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier, and yet somehow, as though by magic, disappear from one side and reappear on the other.
The nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall, you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall.
The nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall, you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall.
Early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here.
My third and final example is the most beautiful, wonderful idea.
The European robin migrates from Scandinavia down to the Mediterranean, every autumn, and like a lot of other marine animals and even insects, they navigate by sensing the Earth's magnetic field.
The puzzle, the mystery was: How does it do it?
The puzzle, the mystery was: How does it do it?
Quantum biology is still in it infancy.
It's still speculative.
But I believe it's built on solid science.
It then became open source, and it allows anybody to browse the net without giving away their location.
Now, the dark net is one of the most interesting, exciting places anywhere on the net.
So on purchasing my item, I would send my bitcoin to a neutral, secure third digital wallet.
And it's that kind of innovation that's why those on the fringes are often the harbingers of what is to come.
Now, we've had distributed computing before, of course.
For folks in this room, the work we do is challenging, it's engaging, it's stimulating, it's meaningful.
And there's something special about idea technology, that makes it different from the technology of things.
A very different picture of your life in local context, of your identity as a set of experiences, may emerge.
The country in which he was born, that country no longer exists.
Take this bird, for example: this is the prothonotary warbler.
It's crazy.
until going further south into the mangrove swamps, and then finally -- finally -- reaching Florida Bay, the emerald gem of the Everglades, the great estuary, the 850 square-mile estuary.
And I see him scanning and searching.
And in that moment, all those months of planning, waiting, all the sunburn, mosquito bites --  Oh my gosh, I can't believe it!] You can believe how excited I was when that happened.
And as the world's largest and most ambitious wetland restoration project, the international spotlight is on us in the Sunshine State.
If we pass it, we get to keep the planet.
So as an activist, I began working with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation -- that's pdf.org -- to create a major initiative to put women on the Parkinson's disease map.
I do not feel diminished by Parkinson's; I feel distilled by it, and I actually very much like the woman I'm distilling into.
Already a universal donor: kidneys, corneas, liver, lungs, tissue, heart, veins, whatever.
Some life forms -- certain mushrooms, snails, jellyfish, worms -- glow bioluminescent, and people as well; we emit infra-red light from our most lucent selves.
But at that moment, I knew that education changed my life.
It transformed me. It gave me status.
It gave me confidence. It gave me a career.
I just want to share this with you.
However, I longed to share my life with someone.
Do I have to run?
Or is it really just about aerobic exercise, getting oxygen to the brain?
Now, throughout much of the recent history of medicine, we've thought about illness and treatment in terms of a profoundly simple model.
You have a pneumonia, you take penicillin, you kill the microbe and you cure the disease.
And we've really spent the last 100 years trying to replicate that model over and over again in noninfectious diseases, in chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and heart disease.
And it's only in the last 10 years or so that we've begun to think about using the immune system, remembering that in fact the cancer cell doesn't grow in a vacuum.
Again, working upwards, since the 1960s and 1970s, we've tried, again, desperately to turn off molecules that operate between nerve cells -- serotonin, dopamine -- and tried to cure depression that way, and that's worked, but then that reached the limit.
Chris Anderson: I really like this metaphor.
Now this seems a bit strange.
Certainly not with business as usual.
And on a patch of grass right next to the water's edge, he found a wetsuit.
And on a patch of grass right next to the water's edge, he found a wetsuit.
So it became a cold case.
Many may think that the story about Shadi and Mouaz is a story about death, but I don't agree.
A better life is a life in safety.
The last time, the camp has grown, maybe four or five thousand people.
And so, together with my colleagues, I've called for a global conversation about the technology that I co-invented, so that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications of a technology like this.
And when those sites are found -- as you can see here, the blue molecule is DNA -- this complex associates with that DNA and allows the Cas9 cleaver to cut up the viral DNA.
So we can think of the Cas9 RNA sentinel complex like a pair of scissors that can cut DNA -- it makes a double-stranded break in the DNA helix.
The reason we envisioned using the CRISPR system for genome engineering is because cells have the ability to detect broken DNA and repair it.
And these technologies were very promising, but the problem was that they were either inefficient, or they were difficult enough to use that most scientists had not adopted them for use in their own laboratories, or certainly for many clinical applications.
Imagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter-mates by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome, and they're otherwise completely normal.
And the point is this: There will be a massive extension of the Internet to close the digital divide, and also to allow for what we call "The Internet of Things" -- tens of billions of devices connected to the Internet.
So the solar cell, for a moment, is harvesting energy from this artificial light source.
If I turn it off, we see it drops.
This means, despite the blockage, there's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell, so that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information, in this case, a high-definition video.
And that picture was published all over.
I still very much like this image.
And of course, we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system, to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity.
The building has become part of everyday life in Beijing.
It is there.
But of course, there's another story to this building.
And the detailed quality of everything we designed was about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants.
Here's a scale comparison to the Centre Pompidou in Paris.
It requires close contact for a message to be sent and received.
Some researchers have begun to ask these questions about certain signs at specific sites, but I believe the time has come to revisit this category as a whole.
As you noticed, that last breath in is slow, deep and intense.
You can't control them, and you shouldn't try to -- you have to let it happen.
You can't control them, and you shouldn't try to -- you have to let it happen.
But free diving is more than just that.
It's about being at ease in the water.
Well, we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum.
So this is what's happening, but when we talk about the rising sea level, we think it's something that happens gradually.
This is what one of the leaders, the Australian leader, said, that we've done our part, we are cutting back.
They carried me around and put me on the table, and put the knife between my legs.
So you have to be there.
Some took on research on my behalf, and others made detours on holidays and business trips to go to bookshops for me.
But I have a confession to make: that phrase drives me nuts.
And yet, almost everyone I meet, no matter how educated, is not sure what a coral is or where they come from.
How would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs when it's an abstract thing they can barely understand?
So let's change that.
They may be able to adjust ever so slightly more readily to this human planet.
They may be able to adjust ever so slightly more readily to this human planet.
Aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet.
It didn't increase smoothly.
The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon, about 60 times more than is in the atmosphere.
This was after about 15 hours of work and we were all a bit trigger-happy, and suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past.
So I want to leave you with this last slide.
LT: Well, that's what's exciting about this subject.
LT: Well, that's what's exciting about this subject.
Very, very mild -- JF: Right.
I think most people actually look past to the horizon.
Over the last century, these two ideas have utterly transformed our understanding of the universe.
Relativity and quantum mechanics appear to suggest that the universe should be a boring place.
If you've ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal and felt a force pulling across that gap, then you've felt the effect of a field.
And the Higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field, except it has a constant value everywhere.
It's all around us right now.
It's all around us right now.
The Higgs field gives mass to the fundamental particles that we're made from.
And this value is crucial.
So this is the first of our dangerous numbers, the strength of the Higgs field.
This number is bigger than any number in astronomy.
Now, we see a multiplication of new conflicts and the old conflicts never died: Afghanistan, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo.
I could not sleep that night, and I decided to do something.
The page became the most followed page in the Arab world.
The auditorium was empty.
The black notes were sticking, the white notes were out of tune, the pedals didn't work and the piano itself was just too small.
Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess.
And so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted by the sights and the sounds of the world around them.
So the psychologist Katherine Phillips, with some colleagues, recently gave murder mystery problems to some students, and these students were collected in groups of four and they were given dossiers with information about a crime -- alibis and evidence, witness statements and three suspects.
Carlos Alomar, great rock guitarist, working with Eno on David Bowie's "Lodger" album, and at one point he turns to Brian and says, "Brian, this experiment is stupid."
You can see starting around the year 2000, the lake level started to drop.
But that's an approach that's fraught with political, legal and social dangers.
And in the process of passing through the wetland and percolating through the ground, the water encounters microbes that live on the surfaces of the plants and the surfaces of the soil, and that purifies the water.
And in the process of passing through the wetland and percolating through the ground, the water encounters microbes that live on the surfaces of the plants and the surfaces of the soil, and that purifies the water.
The ultraviolet light cleaves the hydrogen peroxide into two parts that are called hydroxyl radicals, and these hydroxyl radicals are very potent forms of oxygen that break down most organic chemicals.
The water comes into our treatment wetland, it's exposed to sunlight and algae and those break down the organic chemicals, remove the nutrients and inactivate the waterborne pathogens.
Let's create a water system that's consistent with out environmental values.
So I knew I was dealing with a professional.
So in 2013, my friend Benjamin Laird and I, we created a Turing test for poetry online.
So in 2013, my friend Benjamin Laird and I, we created a Turing test for poetry online.
It's called bot or not, and you can go and play it for yourselves.
But basically, it's the game we just played.
And what are the results?
So RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil, who's a director of engineering at Google and a firm believer in artificial intelligence.
and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure.
The language is just raw material, it could be Chinese, it could be in Swedish, it could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day.
This has led me to understand that the human is not a cold, hard fact.
Rather, it is something that's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time.
So my final insight is that the computer, more or less, works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it.
We show it Emily Dickinson, it gives Emily Dickinson back to us.
We show it Emily Dickinson, it gives Emily Dickinson back to us.
We show it William Blake, that's what it reflects back to us.
We show it Gertrude Stein, what we get back is Gertrude Stein.
So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence recently.
But what we've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact, that it's an ever-shifting, concatenating idea and one that changes over time.
And in this coral, it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass -- could be this fluorescent protein.
You could be swimming right on top of them and not see the seahorse.
Is he creating land? Is he creating sea?
You have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way, and we follow the mothers and fathers.
Presiding over this assembly is Jesus, first a suffering man on the cross, now a glorious ruler in Heaven.
And so after complaints and insistence of trying to get this work destroyed, it was finally the year that Michelangelo died that the Church finally found a compromise, a way to save the painting, and that was in putting up these extra 30 covers, and that happens to be the origin of fig-leafing.
But when the kid comes to us and asks, "So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?"
And every time I would run into a problem in trying to teach myself programming like, "What is object-oriented design or what is garbage collection?", I would try to imagine how a six-year-old little girl would explain the problem.
And, for instance, computers are really good at repeating stuff, so the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this.
I know what a computer is: it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time."
But you kids, you are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer."
And then I had this little girl who came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said, "This bicycle lamp, if it were a computer, it would change colors."
And we got to know the bossy CPU and the helpful RAM and ROM that help it remember things.
And in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience.
And in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem.
So the salamander swims by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait, so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail.
So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage.
So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot, and as you see, it's a cute little robot.
It looks a bit like a toy, but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat.
It looks a bit like a toy, but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat.
So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight, and also very elastic, so you can easily press it down and it will not break.
This is because the brain loses this communication with the spinal cord.
Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level -- to know it in our bones so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior.
But in one study, we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking.
It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism.
And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term, we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance.
And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term, we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance.
However, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States.
This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality -- the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.
But there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left-leaning policies.
I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to.
Currently, our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein.
over fish that we know virtually nothing about?
We don't know what it ate during its lifetime, and we don't know what pollution it encounters.
But let's back up for a second and talk about why fish is the best food choice.
Of course not.
Now, fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to humankind.
And microbes and insects are actually net water producers.
And that's what we've been working on the last couple of years, and that's what we need to be working on together -- rethinking everything from the ground up, with a holistic view across the value chain, connecting all these things across the globe, alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision.
We want to eat good and healthy.
Where does my fish come from?
Where does my fish come from?
In many cases, race adds no relevant information at all.
And the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys' bathroom.
So let me tell you a data science story.
So I said to Nick, "Let's think about glucose.
More interestingly, we had left out diabetics, because diabetics already have messed up glucose.
If people type in "paroxetine" or "Paxil" -- those are synonyms -- and one of those words, the rate goes up to about two percent of diabetes-type words, if you already know that there's that "paroxetine" word.
We need secure systems.
Now, cities have been dealing with this problem for decades.
And so the big question for us was: would it work?
And of course we're seeing that exponential growth happen.
And we have all the data to show that the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers.
Now, to grow so large, an animal like Dreadnoughtus would've had to have been a model of efficiency.
She's also started two additional food stalls and is now making plans for her own restaurant.
And in that moment of openness, a good social justice comedian can stick in a whole bunch of information, and if they're really skilled, a rectal exam.
This isn't political comedy, this is about justice, and no one is against justice.
Two, it's inviting and warm, it makes you feel like you're sitting inside of a burrito.
Right? Because, like, what if it's a bad photo?
Well, the answer is yes, and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.
What are you designing for if you work at Couchsurfing?
SS: Audio editing is like Photoshop for your voice.
And the most popular theory for why that might be the case is that cultures begin to recognize a color only once they have the ability to make that color.
They didn't begin to see it until much later as well.
So until then, even though a color might be all around them, they simply did not have the ability to see it.
It took centuries, even, for humans to realize what we had been ignoring for so long.
We used it [200] years ago to build banks.
It's never going to happen again, I think, because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concrete, of steel, or of the elevator, and it's a media revolution.
We proposed a building that was audacious, that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to, and we were scared and our client was scared and the community was scared, so we created a series of photorealistic renderings that we put onto Facebook and we put onto Instagram, and we let people start to do what they do: share it, comment, like it, hate it.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little reindeer pavilion that's as muscly and sinewy as the animals it's designed to observe.
Low body confidence is undermining academic achievement.
It's an amazing multi-track movie.
Your movie has smell and taste and touch.
It has a sense of your body, pain, hunger, orgasms.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like scenes from your childhood playing before you.
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would have meaning or value.
And since then, there's been a real explosion, a flowering of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this picture.
Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental.
In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.
In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.
Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle outside the physical world as some kind of extra.
Or at a more local level, does an integrated group like the audience at a TED conference, are we right now having a collective TED consciousness, an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinct from the inner movies of each of our parts?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it's at least one worth taking seriously.
Okay, so this panpsychist vision, it is a radical one, and I don't know that it's correct.
So in this case, we're objectifying disabled people for the benefit of nondisabled people.
So I have lived in this body a long time.
I'm quite fond of it.
I really think that this lie that we've been sold about disability is the greatest injustice.
I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement for disabled people, and I want to live in a world where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user.

My family, my friends, complete strangers -- I had spent my entire life trying to not disappoint these people, and now I was turning the world upside down on purpose.
So what you're seeing here is a statement of correspondence that intelligence is a force, F, that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.
And so, given this one equation, it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?
How predictive is it?
Does it predict human-level intelligence?
And the reasoning behind that would be, first, we have, through medicine, managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population.

Its flexible design allows for deep squats, crawls and high-agility movements.
Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set.
So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans.
But play's a shapeshifter.
One of the places we're seeing it, for example, in our culture today, in the United States today, is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.
In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead.
At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose, and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.
Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories would make somebody like me really happy.
The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view, the original anatomical activists, and this is why.
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth.
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.
In a certain sense, it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...
But we know very little about where things go.
So we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in Seattle, just over a year ago, to tag what they were throwing away -- different types of things, as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway.
But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.
The whole building is made of water.
The whole building is made of water.
Or you could close the building, and the whole architecture will disappear, You know, these days, you always get images during the winter, when they take the roof down, of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building."
That's about a 15-foot boat.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline.
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.

It needs truth and beauty, and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a saying, which is, "I collect bad wines."
The only thing that was known is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part, used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.
So that really got my attention, and we started to work on this nearly around the clock, because I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.
So in all, we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is.
Down there is the gray box, and on the top you see the centrifuges.
Think about this: this attack is generic.
It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics, with centrifuges, with uranium enrichment.
But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor, but we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.
But why? Well, transparency is scary -- like that odd, still-screaming bear.
It's unpredictable -- like this odd country road.
The film hasn't even been distributed yet.
It's not even online. It's not even streaming.
And that's been my humbling experience in this.
So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time.
And so that's where physics was at a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little, tiny particles.
And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.
For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming pool-shaped hole underneath the device.
And so that's what we did.
And so that's what we did.
And so we measured its motion.
We found it was moving in really weird ways.
Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating, and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this -- like expanding and contracting bellows.

So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate; we have them work in government.
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.
So you agree to dig it out when it snows.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.
But it's doing something that no other government technology does.
And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.
So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally, that's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government.
And that's important.
They haven't given up on government.
They haven't given up on government.
They haven't given up on government.
This is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.
So one citizen helped another citizen, but government played a key role here.
It connected those two people.
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth.
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card, I have plenty for everyone in the room, and, in fact, everyone in the world, and it's right here.

Instead, what I do and what the designers at Thinking Machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do, much farther and faster than we could ever do.
It says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight.' Doesn't that make you feel confident?"
They stopped us from being inspired.
It can know where we are.
This is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.
But somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem.

Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List.
We recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low.
These guys make their fortunes online, but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking, or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer.
Tell us why your science is relevant to us.
A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed.

Who in the room has a mobile phone with you?
Hold your phones up, hold your phones up!
That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone.
I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees, that's my embellishment for that cloth.

That's the whole idea.
I'm not talking about no free shit, because free is not sustainable.

Why is that? Because the tomato is actually ripe, and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato, and it comes out after several trillionths of a second.
The idea is that we could shine some light on the door.
And because we have a camera that can run so fast, our femto-camera, it has some unique abilities.
By shining one laser, we can record one raw photo, which, you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense, but then we will take a lot of such pictures, dozens of such pictures, put them together, and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light, and from that, can we see the hidden object?
I feel like every time someone sneezes, New Orleans has a parade.
The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America.
