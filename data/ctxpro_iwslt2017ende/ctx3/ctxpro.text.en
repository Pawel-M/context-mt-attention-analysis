And the story began, "Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'" -- "'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'" Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, "One more burger with fries!"
It's not negative; it's positive.
It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced.
And it comes out in May.
Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it.
And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge.
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.
Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work.
You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it.
And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away.
What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with, something like charcoal.
After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln, and then you end up with this carbonized material here.
It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking.
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes.
In fact, it's grown all over the world -- yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava, it's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable.
And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this, we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process, to improve it and make it more accessible to people in the villages there.
And technical assistance might shock you, but it's the worst form of -- today -- of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries. Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day, who are incapable of thinking creatively, or organically.
It's just cash.
Because it lacks the institutional, organizational, managerial forms to turn it into capital. And what is required is a combination of physical capital, institutional capital, human capital -- and security, of course, is critical, but so is information.
It depends on what form it comes, what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it.
We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.
But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.
But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity, all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.
These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area, and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability, and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually
And that is because it's us. It's private industry.
And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say, you know, you could take the word "love" out of a lot of things in our society, put the word "design" in, and it still works, like this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know?
And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say, "This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it."
He said, "Love is not selfish," he said, "Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.' It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month, and it's two times less than last month, so that means you don't love me as much.
We just take seawater and we filter it, and we collect different size organisms on different filters, and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville, where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours.
The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so.
It's not enough your software crashed my Mac, and it constantly hangs and bombs -- it erased my ROMs!
Over the years, it's gotten easier to use.
It's in your gift bag. No, no.
Another one, a guy called -- this is absolutely true -- his computer had crashed, and he told the technician he couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed "11."
I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox -- which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it.
I'm sorry; it's not one yet.
It's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan.
What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts.
I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything.
And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period.
Remember, the hard part is not deciding what features to add, it's deciding what to leave out.
We took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists, and over four days -- it was like this urban barn-raising -- to renovate it, and everyone wanted to help.
It looks like a fairly simple thing, but this was a half a million dollar project?
DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen.
DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded, it wasn't going to happen.
And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen by the end of the Giuliani administration, then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT and the Police Department and all of the -- we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time, and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management.
KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.
It enables that conversation to get serious.
And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this, I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.
So, the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.
It was half as long.
And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance, in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan, because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses, and a million of them urinating and doing other things, and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.
It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm, or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.
But if I could ask you to do one thing, it's not to think about it as a piece of technology, but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine, which can go 60 miles an hour, that can bring you everywhere you want to go, and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile, and it's broken, and it doesn't work.
Yes, it could be attached to this, and yes, on a kilogram of propane, you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.
If you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour, it takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt -- 25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it.
We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing, with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat, then using a little bit of the electricity control that process, and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat, it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it.
And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it diminishing after a year.
And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves -- modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose -- the beginning of tool-making.
And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called, than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred.
And it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest are now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin who've lived there with their wonderful way of living for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted.
It's going to depend on which country they're in -- and we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups -- and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about that I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program and spreading it themselves.
We can destroy a river, and we can bring it back to life.
We can see a whole area desolated, and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help.
And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon called "The Hot Zone." It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus.
So, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ and then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response.
But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response, but can't quite control it.
It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated.
If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now, with chemotherapy and radiation, we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins, or with radiation, trying to kill it.
If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it, or somehow -- you know, it's contained. It's very contained.
If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it, or somehow -- you know, it's contained. It's very contained.
But once it starts moving throughout the body, that's when it becomes deadly.
So first of all I thought, you know, "Wouldn't it be favorable to cancer getting to skeletal muscle?" And as well, cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis, which is really, the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow.
Therefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue, it can't get a blood supply, and can't grow.
It's not harmful; it has just repaired the muscle.
If those diseases where tissues are deteriorating -- for example Alzheimer's, where the brain, the brain cells, die and we need to restore new brain cells, new functional brain cells -- what if we could, in the future, use cancer? A tumor -- put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells?
We were standing out in the desert all alone and, thinking about my house, he said, "Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent, somewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it?"
September 11 generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero, and I'm totally against that.
They want to add to it and it's hard to add to a building like that -- it's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building -- and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and it's a lot of acreage.
No, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos, right?
FG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it.
RSW: Did it leak?
RSW: Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it's been very long.
In trying to understand romantic love, I decided I would read poetry from all over the world, and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China, because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman.
The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out."
And in fact, I think it's more powerful than the sex drive.
They held that baby in front of their face, cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.

When the male brain works well, it works extremely well.
It may decline some more.
It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one -- probably a true story.
It would stop, and then start, and then stop, and then start.
It gives it information. By adding information to matter, it gives it a function that's different than without that structure.
Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface, so that it's self-cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does.
There's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics -- when the building facade paint dries, it mimics the bumps in a self-cleaning leaf, and rainwater cleans the building.
Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta, before it gets into a building, are key technologies.
It builds soil; it cleans air; it cleans water; it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live.
And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay and meeting their needs. So it's not mutually exclusive.
Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?
And I've since then tried to keep technology at arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life.
So I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature, as it relates to the spiritual.
The question that I came up with was this question: what does technology want? And by that, I don't mean, does it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean, what are its inherent trends and biases?
But it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say, if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?
And wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more.
One of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.
That its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.
That its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.
But that does happen in technology. And it turns out that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree, and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system.
So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward's catalog and I randomly went through it. And I took a page -- not quite a random page -- I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made. But I took this page and I said, how many of these things are still being made?
It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along.
but you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.
And when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again, in life's evolution -- we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life -- what they're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens.
It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.
I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies. I don't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about, maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.
I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies. I don't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about, maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.
Maybe in some ways the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.
It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.
And so I think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are.
But I was thinking about this, and I realized that although my new book makes me happy, and I think would make my mother happy, it's not really about happiness.
There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain; there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy; and there are people who like it extra chunky.
And B, we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce, then they would embrace it.
And I won it -- I reached all of these people, and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day.
It's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia.
It's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.
It's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it.
So the way it works is you go down the hallway, and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker, and then you open the locker.
Well, it has kind of a right-leaning bias.
But who does it really look like? The Virgin Mary?
It was in the top five in 2005, called, "Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing."
It's a love story -- she's sort of the Norah Jones of the UK -- about how she much loves her guy, and compared to nine million bicycles, and so forth.
That in fact, the publishing process -- just because of the fact that it's complicated, it's heavy, books are expensive -- creates a sort of a wall between authors of books and the ultimate users of books, be they teachers, students or just general readers.
Just to tell you quickly about it: this is an engineering textbook.
It's about 300 pages long, hardbound.
How much would it cost in a bookstore?
If this book were to be published by a regular publisher, it would cost at least 122 dollars.
You can click on every single equation and bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it, tinker with it, understand it.

Imagine Music XML that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music, play with it, understand it.
Imagine Music XML that actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music, play with it, understand it.
In fact, you're free to share it, to do all of these things: to copy it, to change it, even to make commercial use of it, as long as you attribute the author.
And there's actually a tremendous uptake of the number of people that are actually licensing music to make it free for people who do this whole idea of re-sampling, ripping, mixing, burning and sharing.
It's an icon of water itself, and it elevates people's perception of contemporary design.
It's a millefiori of ideas.
It's a weird, kind of freaky place.
It's made from polysaccharides and proteins.
If you pour water on that, it dissolves.
If you took the idea of fractal technology further, take a membrane, shrinking it down constantly like nature does -- that could be a seat for a chair.
It contributes immensely to our -- sense of being, our sense of relationships with things, our sensuality and, you know, the sort of -- even the sort of socio-erotic side, which is very important.
That's the car of the future. It's a water droplet.
It's a city car. You drive along. You get out.
If you put it next to contemporary architecture, it feels totally natural to me.

It's in Notting Hill, next to all the crap -- the prostitutes and all that stuff.
It has a lighting system that changes throughout the day.
It's a homemade video, made it myself at three o'clock in the morning just to show you how my real world is. You never see that.

It's made from Kevlar.
And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this -- that for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available no one bought it; no one knew about it; it was a complete and total failure.
And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this -- that for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available no one bought it; no one knew about it; it was a complete and total failure.
This picture is really fuzzy, I apologize; I had a bad cold when I took it.
They didn't want to buy his bread. It didn't look like "French bread."
It wasn't what they expected.
It was neat; it was remarkable; and slowly, it spread from one person to another person until finally, it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris.
It's as loud as a 747 jet.
But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model.
Hard Candy nail polish, doesn't appeal to everybody, but to the people who love it, they talk about it like crazy.
What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them.
I don't know about you, but if they build it, that's where I'm going to go.
It was a brilliant way of getting the brain high.
And it turned out there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine, but when it came, it really did.
I don't know if you know much about org charts, but if you were to assign a stripped-down and simplified McDonald's org chart, this is exactly what it would look like.
It's amazing, but the top level of the gang, they actually call themselves the "Board of Directors."
It's the idea that the increment to wages that a worker requires to leave him indifferent between performing two tasks, one which is more unpleasant than the other.
And it wasn't perfect. Many children still died, but it was certainly better than what they had before.
And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free, virtually free, and was very easy to use.
But the worst thing about it was that you couldn't use it on the youngest children, on infants, and on one-year-olds.
It only got a 500, it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000."
I can start any number of places, because this process is also -- I think -- very different from some of the morning sessions, which you had such a kind of very clear, such a lineal idea, like the last one, say, with Howard, that I think the creative process in architecture, the design process, is extremely circuitous. It's labyrinthine.
It has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous, and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is.
I wanted a pure thing, and I can't get it.
It forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind.
It adjusts continually. And we removed the air conditioning.
There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work.
and we wanted nothing left. We wanted it to stay green.
And that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion, broken up by a series of courts, and it's five acres of uninterrupted, horizontal space for their administrative offices.
And a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank, which again used this idea of connecting typology, the traditional buildings, and morphology, or the relationship of the development of land as an idea, into a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting, this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it,
One enters the building as it lifts off the ground, and it becomes part of the idea.
And then, again, in a more, kind of traditional setting, this is a graduate student housing in Toronto, and it's very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a connective tissue to the city.
We construct it and we construct those ideas.
Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures, I realized that I could add still another thing I was trying to make a subject -- something that would interfere with the themes, so chocolate is very good, because it has -- it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance.
The question is, what's the good you can do with it?
But I know this organization doesn't change until it experiences failure.
Same thing: gave her a picture, she held it up to her forehead.
And, you know, I wrote a book. So I'll say something --  -- I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made, and why Francis and I found it.
You know, Darwin explained life after it got started, but what was the essence of life?
But just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up?
They said it was lousy, and it was.
And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap.
And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap.
So this was, you know, unexpected from the world's --  -- and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups.
It was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein?
And now I have a sort of vested interest: I want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know, you aren't treated if it's not dangerous.
It was a 10 by 10 cell.
Armstrong O'Brian, Jr. shared it with three other men.
Charles Van Doren, who was later a senior editor of Britannica, said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical -- it should stop being safe.
So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is, why isn't it all rubbish? Why is the website as good as it is?
First of all, how good is it? Well, it's pretty good. It isn't perfect, but it's much better than you would expect, given our completely chaotic model.
So this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done.
So as soon as he made his change, it went to the "Recent changes" page.
So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists, because it is sometimes vandalized.
There's a "new pages feed," for example, so you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it's created.
In fact, we're very flexible about the social methodology, because ultimately, the passion of the community is for the quality of the work, not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it.
And the storyline is, there's this crazy thing, Wikipedia, but academics hate it and teachers hate it. And that turns out to not be true.
Nano-engineered fuel cells could provide the energy where it's needed.
It took us three years to double our price performance of computing in 1900, two years in the middle; we're now doubling it every one year.
What you're watching is a design of a robotic red blood cell, and it does bring up the issue that our biology is actually very sub-optimal, even though it's remarkable in its intricacy.
It would be able to translate from one language to another.
It'll be millions of times more powerful than it is today.
Human life expectancy is expanding. It was 37 in 1800, and with this sort of biotechnology, nano-technology revolutions, this will move up very rapidly in the years ahead.
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.
It's not just about life, of course --  -- it's about healthy life, you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun.
So really, this is how I would like to describe it.
It's a global trance.
But the question is, are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite, namely, leaving aging as it is?
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know, we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds, and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know, we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds, and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.
In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple, but it's not simple.
And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question, and it's extremely hard to answer.
That will be history at this point, because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans, since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.
We can call it the "engineering approach," and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.
It does not intervene in this process or this one.
This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality, when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?
As a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many.
There's stromatolites down there -- the first living things to capture photosynthesis -- and it's the only place they still occur today.
Life needs a membrane to contain itself so it can replicate and mutate.
Shallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed into more complex forms.
Life is a force in its own right. It is a new element.
And it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin.
And where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter, Mars is still not very far.
And where water is liquid, it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll -- and that molecular marvel is what's made a difference -- it powers everything.
And where water is liquid, it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll -- and that molecular marvel is what's made a difference -- it powers everything.
And one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning is that it now includes a kind of learning which is a little bit more like walking and talking, in the sense that a lot of it is driven by the learner himself or herself.
And it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price, OK?
It can even have a pixel or two missing. It doesn't have to be that bright.
When you open it up, it's going to go 'bing.'" It'll be on.
Now, people ask all the time what it is.
That's what it is.
The two pieces that are probably notable: it'll be a mesh network, so when the kids open up their laptops, they all become a network, and then just need one or two points of backhaul.
And one of the reasons you can't see it is because it's backlighting most of the time, most cell phones.
It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down.
And more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.
It was what he called "fine-grained relinquishment."
The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley, so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor, you could actually have a conversation with them.
We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it, called "Thoughtless Acts?"
It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do, which have huge intention and huge opportunity.
We co-opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another.
Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me, because they're impossible to assemble.
So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company, the needs of the individuals in the company, to feel good about a product we were actually designing, and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.
Sometimes, we don't see a problem because either it's too familiar or it's too big.
Can't see it because it's too big.
Can't see it because it's too big.
I think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem.
You would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big, but it's a very neglected area.
Now, let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem, because it's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp.
Every once in a while we have these moments, and we realize just how good life can be when it's at its best.
Or how bad it can be at its worst.
The third big problem is that life isn't usually as wonderful as it could be.
You can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when it's naturally polygamous.
And so, to fix this third problem, I think we need -- slowly, carefully, with ethical wisdom and constraint -- develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there.
By pulling a string, it vibrates and produces a sound wave, which passes through a piece of wood called a bridge, and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified, but ... let me think.
It's called "Abegg Variations," by Robert Schumann, a German 19th-century composer.
It's written around 1834, so even though it's old, I hope you'll like it.
It's written around 1834, so even though it's old, I hope you'll like it.
Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well, but an explanatory model, embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure.
And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem, merely to postpone it by a little. So it's already too late to avoid it, and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger.
If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only, then it would achieve very little of either.
And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have, and said, "You know, well, if I have to talk about the future, what is it?"
It is so much stranger than you think.
And that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers, and it's a complex 3D structure.
The secret to biology is, it builds computation into the way it makes things. So this little thing here, polymerase, is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA.
Now, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that, and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure, and in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up and then reassemble it so it's a linear string that will fold from a sequence. And now I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits.

And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you've cooked it. Pop it out.
Now you've finished the lens, you literally pop it out.
So literally, you think about a rope. It has very complex structure in the weave.
And under no load, it's one structure.
Under a different load, it's a different structure. And you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor.

But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful."
On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.
And I went, very eagerly, to see it, because -- well, also, with an eye on this conference.
The old story about climate protection is that it's costly, or it would have been done already.
The new story about climate protection is that it's not costly, but profitable.
They don't like fighting over oil, they don't like being in the sands and they don't like where the oil money goes and what sort of instability it creates.
But it's even a better deal for heavy trucks, where you save a similar amount at 25 cents a gallon, with better aerodynamics and tires and engines, and so on, and taking out weight so you can put it into payload.
But they'll sell it to Japan and China instead, because we have tariff barriers to protect our corn farmers, and they don't.
Or we could use the saved gas directly to cover all of this balance, or if we used it as hydrogen, which is more profitable and efficient, we'd get rid of the domestic oil too.
That in creating the move to high-volume, low-cost commercial production of these kinds of materials, or for that matter, ultra-light steels that are a good backup technology, the military can do the trick it did in turning DARPAnet into the Internet.
And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx.
And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park.
Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere.
Many architects seemed to think that when you design, you design a jewel, and it's a jewel that you try and crave for; whereas I felt that when you design, you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing.
So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it, but for the community as a whole.
It led to a whole variety of ideas.
Within three days, we realized the problem was not housing; it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS.
And on the fourth week, the doctors come and they mow out an area, put a tensile structure on the top, and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers, you cut down the clinic and you eat it.
They said, this is our design, because it's not only about engaging a community; it's about empowering a community, and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process.
And we start construction in June, and it will be opened by TEDGlobal.
because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.
And again, in "In My World," the competition -- we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it.
It is my world; it's not someone else's. I want to help it; I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations -- and great ideas, I think, come from kids -- and engage their imagination into a project, and do something for schools.
Then we tried it with my son, Dr. Tim Fischell, we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in.
The FDA says, OK, test this final device after it's built in some animal, which we said is a pig, so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack.
It'll pick you up, and then we're going to call your doctor, tell him about it.
We're going to send him the signal that we have, that says you have a heart attack, and we're going to send the signal to the hospital and we're going to have it analyzed there, and there you're going to be with your doctor and you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack."
There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura, and this visual aura, by the way -- and I'll show you a picture -- but it sort of begins with little dancing lights, gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field.
And, by God, the neurologist did erase it, and that's the middle picture: half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse.
SS: But is it safe to use everyday?
We thought we could adapt it for the brain.
The device could be implanted under the scalp to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage, which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around.
no one will know it because you can't tell that it's there.
Well, if we're going to do it for epilepsy, why the hell not try it for something else?
I think she said it looks like a gun. A lot of people don't like guns.
It killed more people than all the wars in history.
In the last century, it killed 500 million people.
In 1980, Steve Jobs gave me that computer, which is Apple number 12, and it's still in Kathmandu, and it's still working, and we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money for Seva.

We will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years.
Within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world.
Now, if we had an "undo" button, and we could go back and isolate it and grab it when it first started -- if we could find it early, and we had early detection and early response, and we could put each one of those viruses in jail -- that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic.
There's an opportunity here, and it's real.
This business, it gets to be addictive, you know what I mean, when somebody else is picking up the tab.
And I would like it to be Ethiopia.
Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS.
We should also do climate change, if for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem.
Because traditional economic theory would say, well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big R&D lab where they were thinking up new projects, and it came out of there. It didn't come from there.
Another answer might be, well, it came from a sort of lone genius working in his garage, who, working away on different kinds of bikes, comes up with a bike out of thin air.
I think it's always been wrong, because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative, and it's probably been largely interactive.
And it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous.
It needed a context, a culture, a community of other vaginas.
Women go days, weeks, months, without looking at it.
It sounds like an infection, at best. Maybe a medical instrument.
Vagina, vagina, vagina. It doesn't matter how many times you say the word, it never sounds like a word you want to say.
It's a completely ridiculous, totally un-sexy word.
If you use it during sex, trying to be politically correct, "Darling, would you stroke my vagina," you kill the act right there.
And she said things that really shocked me about her vagina -- that it was dried-up and finished and dead -- and I was kind of shocked.
But I want to talk a little bit about happiness, and the relationship to this whole vagina journey, because it has been an extraordinary journey that began eight years ago.
The second thing is that what talking about the vagina did is it opened this door which allowed me to see that there was a way to serve the world to make it better.
It has taken me to Juarez, Mexico, where I was a week ago, where I have literally been there in parking lots, where bones of women have washed up and been dumped next to Coca-Cola bottles.
It's a body world, and the species really exists in the body.
So when she got older, she created this incredible thing: it's an anatomical sculpture of a woman's body, half a woman's body.
And I feel, in the last eight years, that this journey -- this miraculous vagina journey -- has taught me this really simple thing, which is that happiness exists in action; it exists in telling the truth and saying what your truth is; and it exists in giving away what you want the most.
I can pan, zoom and rotate it effortlessly.
And when I close it, it becomes a character.
My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status.
Thank you.  So, 15 minutes left.  Well, I was born... no.  I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson.
I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, Or rather, we get educated out of it.
One, it's diverse.
I saw a great t-shirt recently, which said, "If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?"  And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called "Epiphany," which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent.
We walked in this room and it was full of people like me.
So on this side, you've got a number -- you've done it lots of times, so you get it accurately -- which is the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail.
It's not the answer, and it's not because it's only part of the story.
So let's think about a disease that affects -- it's pretty rare, it affects one person in 10,000.
We don't know what it is.
I've got apparently 18 minutes to convince you that history has a direction, an arrow; that in some fundamental sense, it's good; that the arrow points to something positive.
Generations go by, somebody says, hey, why don't we put it on a stick?
It doesn't necessarily predict a win-win outcome.
But I think we're a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending the situation clearly enough, than in comprehending it so clearly that we just can't, you know, get the army out to kill terrorists.
And I say, "That I got to write it."
And when I started the church, you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now.
And then when I wrote this book, and all of a sudden, it just took off, and I started saying, now, what's the purpose of this?
It wasn't mine before I was born, it's not going to be mine after I die, I'm just here for 80 years and then that's it.
I said, "Oh, you don't?" I said, "Let me make this clear again: Do you believe that as human beings -- I'm not talking about religion -- do you believe that as human beings, it is our responsibility to take care of this planet, and make it just a little bit better for the next generation?"
Your worldview, though, does determine everything else in your life, because it determines your decisions; it determines your relationships; it determines your level of confidence.
It determines, really, everything in your life.
We said, "First, we're not going to use it on ourselves."
And I gave it back because I didn't want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money -- I don't.
It's based on a whole different set of things.
You know, there's a story in the Bible about Moses, whether you believe it's true or not, it really doesn't matter to me.
And he picks it back up again, and it becomes a staff again.
And he picks it back up again, and it becomes a staff again.
It's the symbol of his own occupation: I am a shepherd. It's a symbol of his identity, his career, his job.
Second, it's a symbol of not only his identity, it's a symbol of his income, because all of his assets are tied up in sheep.
And the third thing: it's a symbol of his influence.
And it represents your influence.
And so we have to understand not only why tech's important, where it's going, but also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything.
I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future," but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.
The first stage in a technology's advance is that it'll fall below a critical price.
After it falls below a critical price, it will tend, if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.
The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998, it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.
And it started to take off. And you can see that the units started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.
The next thing it hit, a year later, was critical mass. In this case, 20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.
The next phase it hit was displacement.
You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.
As you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part, because it's built on computers -- is falling in price at a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.
Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year; they already have nearly four million registered users -- that's critical mass.
What I'd like to start off with is an observation, which is that if I've learned anything over the last year, it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast.
It's seen as moving in great, unhurried circles.
It's always renewing and refreshing itself.
It's a finite resource; it's always draining away.
You either use it, or lose it.
And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message, which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace.
And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message, which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace.
And I knew that when my book on slowness came out, it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade, but it's also been taken up, with great gusto, by the corporate world -- you know, business press, but also big companies and leadership organizations.
I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off.
I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it.
And I now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to-do list, something that I dreaded, because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly.
Unfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt, the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created, it's got some major, major flaws.
It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable.
Yeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it.
I just love this, you know -- I mean carrying water is such a drag, and somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right?
Basically you can suck any water through this and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips.
So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you.
Boris Nikolayevich says, "It's not for sale."
And it's called fundraising.
It permeates their entire life.
And it's used for communication.
And it's used for conflict resolution.
He doesn't do it yet without a lighter, but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do -- make a fire without a lighter.
It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out.
Panbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica, until Nyota, now one year old, steals it.
And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack.
He wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash.
Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video.
And believe it or not, they went for it.  So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology -- it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light.
And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure.
It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry, because it requires very little material to build this type of surface, and it's very strong.
And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat, and it's a very destructive process.
And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon, because it destroys boat propellers.
Because obviously, if it's breaking snails, the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does.
Because obviously, if it's breaking snails, the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does.
the film here so you can get a very interesting experience. I want you to see how this illusion is constructed, and it's going to rotate so you see that it's inside out. Now watch, as it rotates back, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now.
Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very bright audience, all right? See if you can stop it from happening, even though you know 100 percent it's true that -- bam! You can't undo it. What does that tell you about yourselves? We're going to do it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop it from happening. No. It's difficult.
But in fact, if you reversed the figure ground -- in other words, the dark areas here -- I forgot to ask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it, you'll see a whole series of little dolphins. By the way, if you're also a student at CalTech -- they also tend to just see the dolphins. It's based on experience.
Right. Now, when -- it's interesting that when we look at an image we see, you know, color, depth, texture. And you can look at this whole scene and analyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth. But the whole thing is actually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil.
see it from one little point of view like this.
You can see it's pretty much covered.
A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed, which is unfortunately more in the news these days.
It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and MRIs of whatever is their good arm, to make silicon rubber, then coat it, and paint it in 3D -- exact mirror image of their other limb.
It's got 14 active degrees of freedom.
Now he's going to put that down, pick up a piece of paper, rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist, and read it.
We need to have the biosphere properly explored so that we can understand and competently manage it.
Today, the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia, regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it, are within reach.
It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity.
And most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists to continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago: to search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it.
And most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists to continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago: to search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it.
It can give credit to sound decision-making, adding momentum to success.
In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction, it becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage and asking us to reassess our behavior.
It puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact.
It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.
And as a reaction, it stimulates public opinion and gives impetus to public debate, thereby preventing the interested parties from totally controlling the agenda, much as they would like to.
The press is certainly a business, and in order to survive it must be a successful business, but the right balance must be found between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility.
On a higher plane, the press is a service industry, and the service it provides is awareness.
I had to use it, channel its energy, turn it into something that would clarify my vision, instead of clouding it.
I also want it to be powerful and eloquent, and to do as much justice as possible to the experience of the people I'm photographing.
And the results were so good that the Rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country, and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it.
I am grateful for this prize, and I will use it to that end.
And worst of all, how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me?"
And I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God, but you know, I don't like that word 'heart,' because it anthropomorphizes God, and I don't like the word, 'his,' either, because that sexualizes God."
Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back.
And I said, "I don't want it back. I'm happy without it." Gosh.
When the war broke out, the rebel leader demanded the fund be given to him, my father insisted it was not in his possession, and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund.
It dances to music.
My brother sent me a text message, an SMS -- it was a quote from the "Simpsons." It said, "You tried your hardest and failed miserably.
I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world, but you can see it from there.
And it's always drifting. The pack ice is always drifting.
It just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing -- the plane actually passed over four times, and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all.
Of course, when you're on the ice, you only ever see one obstacle at a time, whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water.
One final thought before I get to the toilet bit, is -- is, I have a -- and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten -- but I have a -- I have a school report. I was 13 years old, and it's framed above my desk at home. It says, "Ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile."
My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater -- at least I thought it was beautiful.
And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach, and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of right across the chest, that were also fuzzy.
And I wore it whenever I could, thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.
And I wore it whenever I could, thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.
We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously, my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again.
I tell that story, because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this Earth.
I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be.
I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be.
It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.
It's the largest company in Tanzania.
And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival.
And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this. And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move.
You can take a data set and put it there.
Here's my proposal, I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it: Education on world religions for all of our children -- in primary school, in high school, in public schools, in private schools and in home schooling.
The design is there in nature, but it's not in anybody's head.
It doesn't have to be.
And there was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good, I'm going to read it to you: "Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life: complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile.
And there was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good, I'm going to read it to you: "Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life: complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile.

And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless, so it runs out in the open, where it'll be eaten by a cat.
And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless, so it runs out in the open, where it'll be eaten by a cat.
It means "surrender of self-interest to the will of Allah."
And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint, because I think it's actually a brilliant book.
Is it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure we all agree, it is a wonderful goal.
Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.
Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.
With me, everybody --  Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.
But I wish it were better.
I wish that sentence weren't in there, because I think it is false.
Remember I quoted him before with this line: "Surrendered people obey God's word, even if it doesn't make sense."
Not just by learning principles, you got in it and you did it so often that it became real.
They're only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us, because it's making us intersect. That intersection doesn't always create a view of "everybody now understands everybody, and everybody appreciates everybody."
Ben and Jerry's doesn't have liver-and-onion ice cream, and it's not because they whipped some up, tried it and went, "Yuck."
"Now that you mention it, it does seem a little silkier!"
You will never see it again."
And people who are deliberating -- "Should I return it?
We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say, "You know, we're doing a photography course, and we can do it one of two ways.
We could do it so that when you take the two pictures, you'd have four days to change your mind, or we're doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it.
It retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns.
There's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength.
The point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used, rather than by the sensory modality involved.
Because there are so many of them, and because there's no agreement among them in their preferred direction of movement, the marble, as we see it in Middle World, stays rock steady.
In this case, the hand would move, and we'd see it waving at us in Middle World. The odds against it, of course, are so great that if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe, you still would not have written enough zeros to this day.
If life has arisen only once on any -- life could originate once per planet, could be extremely common or it could originate once per star or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe, in which case it would have to be here. And somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince, and similar magical things like that.
And when I say quite common, it could still be so rare that no one island of life ever encounters another, which is a sad thought.
In short, when we're thinking like academics, we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines, like computers or cars. But when we revert to being human, we behave more like Basil Fawlty, who, we remember, thrashed his car to teach it a lesson, when it wouldn't start on "Gourmet Night."  The reason we personify things like cars and computers is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world

Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans, it's hardly surprising the same modeling software often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities for which it's not appropriate, like Basil Fawlty with his car or like millions of deluded people, with the universe as a whole.  If the universe is queerer than we can suppose, is it just because we've been naturally selected
And so what I'm going to try to do today is to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling -- I can feel it myself.
It's a Saul Steinberg of course -- it was a New Yorker cover.
There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man.
If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks, then it's not real consciousness, whatever it is.
But I'm going to try to also show you that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous -- your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful -- as you may have thought it is.
And I started across the hall in North Carolina, because I thought it was probably a Canaletto, and would have all that in detail.
Now, what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion?
The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there.
It's just making you expect the detail.
How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right?
We have to have more theory, and it can come as much from the top down.
And it sounds quite simple, but actually it's quite a big, big job.
By holding it tightly, I feel strangely more detached.
Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms, no legs -- they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand.
So to find an actual hall is incredible -- for which you can play exactly what you imagine, without it being cosmetically enhanced.
It may be that the chemistry isn't quite right between myself and that particular piece of music, but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music.
I had to basically look at this particular drum, see how it was made, what these little lugs did, what the snares did.
Turned it upside down, experimented with the shell, experimented with the head.
Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave called "The Monticello Dialogues" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note -- "We realize that design is a signal of intention, but it also has to occur within a world, and we have to understand that world in order to imbue our designs with inherent intelligence, and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs
And so we call it "cradle to cradle," and our goal is very simple.
Now if we look at the word "competition," I'm sure most of you've used it.
You know, most people don't realize it comes from the Latin competere, which means strive together.
And as Francis Crick pointed out, nine years after discovering DNA with Mr. Watson, that life itself has to have growth as a precondition -- it has to have free energy, sunlight and it needs to be an open system of chemicals.
But electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.
You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.
It's an incredible means of coordinating, in a very fine-grained way, information flows.
So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure -- I'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994, when it was growing 2,300 percent a year.
How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994 when people weren't really investing in the Web?
And you'd run a long cord into the house where you could screw it into your light socket.
So you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it.
That's what you did. You didn't turn it off.
And they couldn't yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house.
And you can see why. It's triumphal.
In professional circles everywhere, it's of course universally accepted.
In non-professional circles outside America, it's largely ignored.
But in non-professional circles within America, it arouses so much hostility --  it's fair to say that American biologists are in a state of war.
If I was a person who were interested in preserving religious faith, I would be very afraid of the positive power of evolutionary science, and indeed science generally, but evolution in particular, to inspire and enthrall, precisely because it is atheistic.
Darwinian natural selection is so stunningly elegant because it solves the problem of explaining complexity in terms of nothing but simplicity.
Essentially, it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual, step-by-step increment.
It turns out to be -- in principle -- incapable of doing the job required of it.
It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations, and blinds them to the wonderful, real explanations that we have within our grasp.
It teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith, instead of always insisting on evidence.
And however we define atheism, it's surely the kind of academic belief that a person is entitled to hold without being vilified as an unpatriotic, unelectable non-citizen.
When atheists like Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein use the word "God," they use it of course as a metaphorical shorthand for that deep, mysterious part of physics which we don't yet understand.
Well, here's how it changed me.
Bring it over here and open it up. Aaaah!
It needs to be flat, so it's transportable.
Your favorite singing group -- it's Diana Ross and the -- Audience: Supremes!
So, I talked to Josh Prince-Ramus about the convention center and the conferences. It's getting awfully big.
It's getting just a little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit.
And I fear, if we do nothing for our planet, in 20 years, it's going to look like this.
It climbs up to the top, and it falls, and it climbs, and it falls, and it climbs -- trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass.
Well then, why is it doing this?
Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds, and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant, crawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle.
But it's everybody's idea now.
You want it to be consistent.
Why don't we try changing it every day?"
It would be artificial intelligence.
And so that's something we work on, and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now, and that's really their goal.
And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart, and of course, you know, we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out, and it didn't quite work, and we don't have this feature anymore.
And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart, and of course, you know, we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out, and it didn't quite work, and we don't have this feature anymore.
The public realm in America has two roles: it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life, and it is the physical manifestation of the common good.
The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically, but it has to inform us where we are in our culture.
Where we've come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to, by doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present.
It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined.
It is emphatically an outdoor public room.
It has something that is terribly important -- it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.
That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations -- things go in and out of it. It's permeable.
That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations -- things go in and out of it. It's permeable.
The beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out, and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.
You know, that it's a despotic building; it wants us to feel like termites.  This is it on a smaller scale: the back of the civic center in my town, Saratoga Springs, New York.
It was: "Fuck it."   That -- that is the message of this form of architecture.
It's not that complicated: buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge, so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.
You know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding of the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.
And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.
Because it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now.
And so then the object -- the merchandise that you're interested in -- can be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room, and in the dressing room there are scanners so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room.
So this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time.
It's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye, started by Nigel Jagger in London.
And it's a company that's trying to bring the experience -- many people have boats, or enjoy being on boats, but a very small percentage of people actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water and actually seeing what's there, and enjoying what scuba divers do.
And the other one was to design the object and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool.
It can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate, and is equipped with powerful lights.
It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep.
The battery-powered Spyfish sends the live video-feed through a slender cable.) DK: This slender cable was a huge technological advancement and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is.
But sometimes, a science has some other attributes which makes it really, really interesting.
Sometimes a science will tell something about ourselves, it'll tell us who we are.
It's got a lot of cells in it too, right?
Finally, another thing is the answer was there all along, but we kind of ignored it because of this obvious thing, and that's the thing.
It was an intuitive, strong-held belief that was wrong.
The AI people said, well, the thing in the box is a programmable computer because that's equivalent to a brain, and we'll feed it some inputs and we'll get it to do something, have some behavior.
Well I'll argue a non-intelligent brain, we got hold of an old brain, and we're going to say it's like a non-mammal, like a reptile, so I'll say, an alligator; we have an alligator.
It's got good eyes and ears and touch senses and so on, a mouth and a nose. It has very complex behavior.
It can run and hide. It has fears and emotions. It can eat you, you know.
It can attack. It can do all kinds of stuff.
But it has all this complex behavior already.
You do. It's your emotional brain.
It's sitting there saying, ah, I'm going to memorize all the things that are going on: where I've been, people I've seen, things I've heard, and so on.
It allows you to, literally it feeds back the signals into your brain; they'll let you see what's going to happen next, will let you hear the word "sentence" before I said it.
And the altered door thought experiment says, you have a door at home, and when you're here, I'm changing it, I've got a guy back at your house right now, moving the door around, and they're going to take your doorknob and move it over two inches.
I can make it larger or smaller, I can change its brass to silver, I could make it a lever. I can change your door, put colors on; I can put windows in. I can change a thousand things about your door, and in the two seconds you take to open your door, you're going to notice that something has changed.
Now, the engineering approach to this, the AI approach to this, is to build a door database. It has all the door attributes.
As I put my hand on this table, I expect to feel it stop.
When I walk, every step, if I missed it by an eighth of an inch, I'll know something has changed.
We test it by prediction. What is the next word in this, you know?
And the framework is a memory framework, not a computation or behavior framework. It's a memory framework.
Anyone who gets up and tells you their theory about how the brain works and doesn't tell you exactly how it's working in the brain and how the wiring works in the brain, it is not a theory.
A song must be heard in sequence over time, and you must play it back in sequence over time.
And as I said, the theory must be biologically accurate, it must be testable, and you must be able to build it.
And as I said, the theory must be biologically accurate, it must be testable, and you must be able to build it.
If you don't build it, you don't understand it. So, one more slide here.
And it's a lively and a lovely place, but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our -- not only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing, our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland, but also, most recently, with climate change, and Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.
It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.
And you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe, I hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out during the course that the tag is recording.
So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think about what is happening on the other side of the globe -- where the money's going and what can be done to stop it.
We put together a program that would, one: get the state out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.
The state should not be in the business of producing goods and services because it's inefficient and incompetent.
You couldn't get it. You had to bribe.
And that shores up our economy, makes it stable.
But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now, will miss it forever.
I'm scared and I'm angry." And then she turned to me and said, "Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it." Wow.
You know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill, so it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32.
Alan Kay is famous for saying the best way to predict the future is to invent it.
And, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say the second best way is to finance it.
It is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet?
But of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion is that it is more fun.
It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key.
And the first person who gets happy when you do that, you don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself, because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it.
It's so much more subtle, so much more visceral -- you know, what's visible, what's not.
But what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this, it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move but if I throw it at the lighter guys, right?
Despite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared, because it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties.
Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth, global perspective, local knowledge.
We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors, disaster areas. We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue.
I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles.
U.N. opened their statistic databases, and we have a new version of the software up working as a beta on the net, so you don't have to download it any longer.
It comes beyond here, when you really can get good working conditions in the family.
Economic growth to me, as a public-health professor, is the most important thing for development because it explains 80 percent of survival.
It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.
It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.
It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.
And I'm going to take this blade of steel, and push it down through my body of blood and flesh, and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.
While our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough.
If there is a monster underground, it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.
It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice.
There are more stages involved here than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive through the space, we populate it with environmental variables -- sulphide, halide, things like that.
In fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower if you can find propellant on the moon.
That signal was so strong, it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material.
I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it so we're not going to burn the gear.
But, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it, and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done.
It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale.
We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic, and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
But eventually it stops working, and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.
But it's applicable, again, to every organ system.
And finally, we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig, if you threw away all the cells, and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active, may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself.
I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling.
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn't have before.
He chills the dish, it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish.
It's going to be about thinking about how it evolves, and how people respond to it.
So AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection, and it kills you.
And if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was, then there are all sorts of other things maybe we should be spending our money on instead.
It's a bit different from the others.
The time capsule was available for one month online, translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.
It's a spinning globe, the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule.
And it stays that size until the queen dies and there's nobody to make more ants, when she's about 15 or 20 years old.
That's not just how is the colony organized, but how does it change what it's doing?
And in harvester ants, I divide the tasks of the ants I see just outside the nest into these four categories: where an ant is foraging, when it's out along the foraging trail, searching for food or bringing food back.
On one day, it'll all be here, and then the next day they'll move it over there, and then they'll move it back.
When the foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber, and other ants come up from below, get the food, bring it back, husk the seeds, and pile them up.
When the foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber, and other ants come up from below, get the food, bring it back, husk the seeds, and pile them up.
When one ant touches another, it's smelling it, and it can tell, for example, whether the other ant is a nest mate because ants cover themselves and each other, through grooming, with a layer of grease, which carries a colony-specific odor.
And the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out, and what it does when it comes back out.
So, what's interesting about this system is that it's messy.
It's variable. It's noisy. And, in particular, in two ways.
Evolution is usually presented as this one path that we took through, but really it represents this huge set of possibilities.
Let me give it a little weapon on the tail here, so it can fight.
Now, at this phase, the program actually has some understanding of the topology of this creature. It kind of knows where the backbone is, where the spine, the limbs are.
It kind of knows how stripes should run, how it should be shaded.
It's looking at whatever I've designed. It will actually bring it to life.
You know, what happens if you give somebody a toy planet, and let them play with a lot of dynamics on it, what could they discover? What might they learn on this?
They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do.
I figured, surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world, really, aren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope like they invented it, right?
It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m."
It's the seat of government.
It's dysfunctional.
When they make a profit it is theirs to keep, not for the chief to sequester it from them.
And then it will have what economists call external effects on a local economy.
Why I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well.
But it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic, we would have failed.
CA: And you made it out of what?
CA: And so, and that windmill, what -- it worked?
WK: When the wind blows, it rotates and generates.
It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine.
And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me because I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment.
And global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties.
It's called "Ode to the Drum," and I'll try and read it the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read.
It's called "Ode to the Drum," and I'll try and read it the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read.
It matters a great deal.
There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code, and if so, what it should look like.
Now, we cannot achieve perfection, but if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence.
And I did, and we ended up naming it Duterimbere, meaning "to go forward with enthusiasm." And while we were doing it, I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable and started by women, and so maybe I should try to run a business, too.
I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business, that, in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person, who essentially spent 600 dollars a month to keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods, and living on 50 cents a day, still in poverty.
And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting, but it's also learning how better to ask questions.
And, of course, I’m dedicating it also to my grandmother, whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles, especially for me when I was an activist, and being harassed by the police.
It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity.
It will sit with those who create wealth.
The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy, it lies with international donors.
It may have built a road, and that road may have served a very good role.
Here, I'll show it to you.
The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite, out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.
It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.
You know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away.
The English language is as big as it is.
The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.
If you love a word, use it. That makes it real.
If you love a word, it becomes real.
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes, is touched, any time you touch a word, you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation, you verb it, you make the mobile move.
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes, is touched, any time you touch a word, you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation, you verb it, you make the mobile move.
You didn't break it. It's just in a new position, and that new position can be just as beautiful.
You didn't break it. It's just in a new position, and that new position can be just as beautiful.
Where did it come from? Who said it?
Where did it come from? Who said it?
What newspaper was it in? What book?
They use it synecdochically.
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language.
So 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel, we have a new wheel. I will show you, in the next video -- can you start it, please? -- that very heavy loads can be moved.
There's a guy pushing there, behind, but it can also walk on the wind very well.
It's 3.2 tons.
It has a feeler, where it can feel obstacles and turn around.
You see, it's going the other way.
And it must feel the water of the sea.
And this is the water feeler, and what's very important is this tube. It sucks in air normally, but when it swallows water, it feels the resistance of it.
As soon as it touches the water -- you should hear a sound of running air.
Yes! So if it doesn't feel, it will be drowned, OK?
In fact, it is a step counter, and it counts the steps.
It's a binary step counter.
So as soon it has been to the sea, it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here.
And it always knows where it is on the beach. So it's very simple brain.
It says, well, there's the sea, there are dunes, and I'm here.
We teach it to our children. We hear it on television and in storybooks. Now, the original title of this session was, "Everything You Know Is Wrong," and I'm going to present evidence that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong, that, in fact, our ancestors were far more violent than we are, that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time, and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence.
Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy, in failed states, collapsed empires, frontier regions, mafias, street gangs and so on.
And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language -- the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary, it will already be well out of date.
It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted.
When you construe it as "cause the mouse to have something," you're doing something to the mouse, and therefore you express it as, "Give the mouse the muffin."
But this machine doesn't know what it looks like.
You look at it and you see it has four legs, the machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree, it doesn't have any idea what it looks like, but it's going to try to find that out.
But when you look at that, you have to remember that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward, nor did it have a model of itself.
It kind of figured out what it looks like, and how to move forward, and then actually tried that out.
So you're feeding it with more material -- cubes in this case -- and more energy, and it can make another robot.
So you're feeding it with more material -- cubes in this case -- and more energy, and it can make another robot.
We can look at our own history. The late physicist Gerard O'Neill said, "Advanced Western civilization has had a destructive effect on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with, even in those cases where every attempt was made to protect and guard the primitive civilization."
And when that ecosystem collapses, it could take a major ecosystem with it, like our atmosphere. So, what do we do about this? What are the solutions?
This stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the United States, and it got into the human food supply, and somebody should've figured out that it would get in the human food supply very easily.
A staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it when antibiotics come, and change and mutate.
About a billion miles away, here's what happens to Earth's orbit: it becomes elliptical instead of circular.
It passed directly through Earth's orbit. We were in that that spot six hours earlier.
And here is full scale -- it's a tiny bone.
So then, once you've done that, the next stage is to know what it is.
When we did the analysis of this bone, it was clear that it looked very chimp-like, chimpanzee-like.
And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak, he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma, and they want to know what drives you a bit.
And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film, because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having Al go around the world, speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.
and it's really changed the debate on global warming.
It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968, Abby Hoffman and crew, and, again, a story about a small group of individuals who did make change in the world.
I was thinking, I just finished making another film about World War II vets, and I realized I'd gotten to know their stories, and I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to tell a warrior's story as it unfolded.
It's our trailer, because I know, obviously you guys are busy, many of you may not have had a chance to see it.
We got in a conversation with some other people in the class, and it went on and on.
So I wanted to show you a clip, and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together.
I knew about that journal, but it was very, very private.
It's kind of a book about questions, questions about simplicity.
Many of you may not like tofu because you haven't had good tofu, but tofu's a good food. It's a very simple kind of food.
But the Media Lab is an interesting place, and it's important to me because as a student, I was a computer science undergrad, and I discovered design later on in my life.
It's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries.
It's a very short, simple book. There are ten laws and three keys.
The ten laws and three keys -- I won't go over them because that's why I have a book, and also that's why it's on the Web for free.
It has facilities like swimming pools, it has flextime, it has a social heart, a space, you have contact with nature.
It anticipated change, even though those changes were not known.
It's a viewing place for people, not machinery.
Comparing it with a typical building, what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large-scale thinking?
The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools, where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing.
Will the computer last, or will they break it and steal it -- and did anyone teach them?
So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it, this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India, where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.
It was that primary education can happen on its own, or parts of it can happen on its own.
As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.
I wanted to show the slide -- this slide, I think, is the most important one any of you will see, ever, because --   -- it shows nature versus humans, and goes from 1850 to 2050.
PM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications, and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet.
Eventually, it will be able to have to stay up day, night, day, night, for six months at a time, acting like the synchronous satellite, but only ten miles above the Earth.
Alan Alda: He's got it, he's got it, he's got it on his head.
Alan Alda: He's got it, he's got it, he's got it on his head.
The launch is the difficult part: you've got to hold it high up, over your head, and you start walking forward, and just let go of it, and you can control it like that.
Most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth. But it has a dark side -- in bioweapons, and in technology that puts us on a collision course to magnify any anger, hatred or feeling of marginalization.
We all felt that we were part of it, that a better world was right around the corner, that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice.
And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now, and it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.
This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.
It's a condensable in the atmosphere, and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK, and above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze, which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.
It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission, and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany, and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents, and American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.
And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.
It's about the size of Lake Ontario.
I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd -- she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.
And, anyway, the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off.
CA: I was actually also curious why -- I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates.
RB: It's about 25 billion dollars now, in total.
But the trouble is, it kept on tipping over, but --  CA: Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps?
RB: Yeah, it'll be ready in -- well, ready in 12 months and then we do 12 months extensive testing.
And we were just crossing every finger, praying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did.
CA: Did you jump? Or it came down in the end?
But fortunately, they never had to use it.
We hoped we'd be funny, but we didn't know it would be a cover, and we didn't know that that image, at the moment that it happened, would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people.
So I decided it needed a few -- it needed a lift, it needed a few illustrations.
So I've joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using DNA. We use DNA because it's cheaper, it's easier to handle, it's something we understand really well -- so well, in fact, that we think we can actually write programming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers.
I decided to use a type of DNA origami, where you take a long strand of DNA and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want.
It's very ingenious, as all Freudian arguments are --  -- but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion, a patient having the same delusion, about his pet poodle.
He'll say, "Doctor, this is not Fifi. It looks exactly like Fifi, but it's some other dog." Right?
When he sees her in person, he says it's an impostor.
It'll pat his brother on the shoulder, it'll answer the phone when it rings, it'll wave goodbye.
It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful.
If only I could move it, maybe the pain will be relieved."
When the arm was intact, but paralyzed, the brain sends commands to the arm, the front of the brain, saying, "Move," but it's getting visual feedback saying, "No."
But he's not stupid. He knows it's not real.
"Oh, nothing. It's clenched again."
I said, "Look, it's, after all, two dollars. Take it home."
So, he took it home, and after two weeks, he phones me, and he said, "Doctor, you're not going to believe this."
He said, "It's gone."
It's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back.
It goes into a sort of denial -- it gates the signals.
Now, this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki, so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain, and indeed, people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation.
He pointed out that certain people in the population, who are otherwise completely normal, had the following peculiarity: every time they see a number, it's colored.
It's never been answered before.
OK, what is synesthesia? What causes it?
And who gets to express it, and how do we express it?
And because of that, as grain changes hands -- and I've measured that it changes hands four, five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer -- every time it changes hands -- and I've seen this all over rural Africa -- it also changes sacks.
In the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market.
But once it arrived, if no buyer was to be found, or if prices suddenly dropped, farmers would incur tremendous losses.
And in fact, would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan, rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms.
It's a culture where people participate in the creation and the re-creation of their culture. In that sense, it's read-write.
Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity because of these, quote, "infernal machines." They would take it away.
So, second. Land is a kind of property -- it is property. It's protected by law.
They live life knowing they live it against the law.
That's the first time I've ever played it.
It's called "Tembererana."
It's based on an Argentinian rhythm called "carnivalito."
Not only would it lift, but it might never return.
And of course, in those days, there were no antidepressant drugs, and it became very, very popular.
And the reason that it has had a renaissance is that probably about 10 percent of the people, severe depressives, do not respond, regardless of what is done for them.
Resuscitated the career, even better than it had been before.
And the mobile phone, in addition, is both personal -- and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it's convenient.
And it turns out, delegation -- if you want it to be -- can be the solution for pretty much everything, apart from things like bodily functions, going to the toilet.
This is from a workbench in Jilin City, in China, and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together.
And so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid, in a way that we just totally cannot conceive, when you get it to 6.3 billion and the growth in the world's population.
We like our suffering because it's so good when it ceases for a while."
It's about two meters by three, and you are all welcome any time.
And probably, the fact that we don't know that is why, so often, although we seek happiness, it seems we turn our back to it.
Although we want to avoid suffering, it seems we are running somewhat towards it.
After some moments, you just go a little back, and then it starts burning.
It sort of uses itself as you experience it.
It sort of uses itself as you experience it.
And also, again, it can -- also, it's something that you -- it is not something that is radiating outside.
Likewise, if you look at the thought of anger, it will vanish like frost under the morning sun.
Here is the preliminary result, which I can show because it's already been shown.
That people have just sort of figured out about it, and now with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something, we may be on the road to a solution.
And that it's accelerating even faster than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back.
It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it.
That the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about, is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologies that will reduce emissions -- but also, I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climate and weather control, whether we like it or not.
And it's time to begin thinking about it, even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments for why we shouldn't do it.
One of the ironies of this whole system is we're discussing what to do about a system that we don't understand. We don't even know what oil is. We don't know where oil comes from. I mean, literally, it's still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from. The best assumption, and one of the best guesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes
Now, the interesting thing about that thesis -- if that thesis turns out to be true -- is that oil, and all hydrocarbons, turned out to be concentrated sunlight. And if you think of bioenergy, bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is taking the sun, concentrating it in amoebas, concentrating it in plants, and maybe that's why you get these rainbows.
Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same stuff. It is probably plants, except that these have been burned and crushed under pressure.
And I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like, and so on.
But the main thing here is that it predicts probabilities.
It's a design inspired by nature, but it's not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at, but it's a synthesis of the secrets of many, many feet.
It's still running at the human equivalent of 300 miles per hour.
Now how could it do that? Well, look more carefully.
It's acting, again, as a distributed foot -- very effective.
It's a shrimp-like animal called the stomatopod, and here's how it moves on the beaches of Panama: it actually rolls, and it can even roll uphill.
RHex's foot started off to be quite simple, then it got tuned over time, and ultimately resulted in this half circle.
What you'll see, in fact, is that it's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot.
Watch it go over this.
Robert Full: It's spiny, right? It's really spiny, isn't it? It sort of hurts.
Maybe we could give it to our curator and see if he'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach.
How does it do it?
Watch the leg come around, and you'll see it grab on right there.
It looks, in fact, like it's swimming up the surface.
It just extrudes.
It has a hundred to a thousand split ends, and that's the secret, because it allows intimate contact.
It's aerated, it can be peeled off easily, it doesn't cause any irritation, it works underwater.
It's aerated, it can be peeled off easily, it doesn't cause any irritation, it works underwater.
It's six-legged and has a tail. Here it is on a fence and a tree.
You have the audio? You can hear it go up.
Now it's only using its simplest feet here, so this is very new.
After, there is the narcissistic design: it's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers.  After, there is people like me, who try to deserve to exist, and who are so ashamed to make this useless job, who try to do it in another way, and they try, I try, to not make the object for the object but for the result, for the profit for the human being, the person who will use it.
There is so many things to do; it's so fresh.
It's made of light and shadow.
Because it's not, the barbaria we have today, it's perhaps not the barbaria we think.
It's called Owari in Ghana, where I studied it; it's called Mancala here on the East Coast, Bao in Kenya, Sogo elsewhere.
It's called Owari in Ghana, where I studied it; it's called Mancala here on the East Coast, Bao in Kenya, Sogo elsewhere.
The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found was actually not in geometry, it was in a symbolic code, and this was Bamana sand divination.
You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast, and often the symbols are very well preserved, so each of these symbols has four bits -- it's a four-bit binary word -- you draw these lines in the sand randomly, and then you count off, and if it's an odd number, you put down one stroke, and if it's an even number, you put down two strokes.
When you have a four-bit symbol, you then put it together with another one sideways.
I didn't put his name up here -- my colleague, Kerry, in Kenya, has come up with this great idea for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure, because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village, it doesn't quite fit.
It's in the -- it's in Google's search engine.
Now bring it out, bring it out. Anybody else?
And instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me what you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random three-digit number.
It goes as far back into the past as 1800, because you never know.
Or we don't know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient; it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill? In other words, we're oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use.
And it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt.
There's a company, Bennett and Company, that supplies Polo.com, Victoria's Secret -- they, because of their CEO, who's aware of this, in China formed a joint venture with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater.
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes.
You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah.
And it's a powerful and empowering tool.
And throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind of whole-body training.
Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school, and we'll take it apart with them.
It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3, and play it on your very same computer.

Find a big empty lot, make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property, and let them drive your car.
She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick, and ties it with her own hair.
It has evolved. If you don't like the term, change it, for Goddess' sake.
It has evolved. If you don't like the term, change it, for Goddess' sake.
Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want; the name doesn't matter, as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it.
It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.
Just an amazing animal, it can change color and texture to match the surroundings. Watch him blend right into this algae.
Design can be that, of course, but it can also be this.
And then when 9/11 happened, I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition until, slowly but surely, it came back -- as a half-full glass instead of half-empty -- and it was about protection and safety.
The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest and the police comes towards you, you're wearing this thing -- it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart so your heartbeat is amplified -- and the police is reminded; it's like having a flower in front of the rifle.
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales, and therefore, really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful.
And clearly this composition is his final statement to her -- it was first performed after his death -- and through her to the world.
They would not leave me alone until I let them have a piece, but it was not a good one."  Well, it occurred to me that I should invite Dr. Robicsek to lecture at Wofford College on -- what else?
I was still trying to take in the notion that these titans, these masters of the universe, in their spare time watch Harry Potter movies, when Mr. Milliken thought he would win the argument by saying, "You just think it's so good because you didn't read the book."
As you can see, it has world class art, and it's all my taste because I raised all the money.
I said, "Senator, I'm reluctant to go into a field that I don't know much about, but I promise you that if you'll support my school, I'll get it built and in a couple of years, I'll come back and weigh out that program that you desire."
That good food's not for rich people -- good food's for everybody on the planet, and there's no excuse why we all can't be eating it.
And I'm going to allow you to record the concert and I'm going to give you the music, and if you ever choose to sell it, you must sign an agreement that says the money will come back and support the school."
And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy.
If you'd have dropped a bomb on that room, you'd have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania because it was all sitting there.
It's also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot -- triple that in the middle of the inner city.
And he said, "As God as my witness, I've had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you've built it.
And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing, and we're going to build it all right.
So, I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana, but I couldn't erase this from my memory and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche.
I then went on to make more comments on the media and press imagery, so I started making reference to media imagery -- made it grainy, shot through doorways and so on and so forth -- to titillate the public or the viewer further in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism.
And at the same time, it removes us from the real subject matter, and this acts as a sort of titillating thing.
They thought it was real.
This image is quite interesting, actually, because I think we made it three years ago.
This image, for example, is sort of spot-on because it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private, and also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein, and George Bush reading the Koran upside-down.
I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law -- ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever.
I mean, it had to. Right? I was in for quite a surprise.
You can view it as a computing problem, an artificial intelligence problem: do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly?
Just the pursuit of interest, wherever it lies, across all the disciplines that are represented here.
It required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 seconds to reserve a car, go get it, drive it.
And if we have it, you'll decide how many miles to drive, what mode of travel, where to live and work.
When are we going to do it? Are we going to wait 10 to 15 years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years?
You can look at the terminal and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street and when it's coming, and you can buy your tickets in real time.
During many years, I made some speeches starting with this saying: "City is not a problem, it's a solution."
And more and more, I'm convinced that it's not only a solution for a country, but it's a solution for the problem of climate change.
I want to say a word for nature because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days.
It's not my idea, other people have hit on it, but I've tried to take it to some new places.
And one of the things I really like about gardening is that it doesn't take all your concentration, you really can't get hurt -- it's not like woodworking -- and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation.
I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits -- color, scent, flavor, pattern -- that has lured that bee in.
So it helped me understand industrial agriculture, which of course is a Cartesian system.
again, give each species what it wants, let it realize its desires, its physiological distinctiveness.

It's created from the bottom up.
More protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted.
He started a computer tournament for people to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered, much to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won -- it won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won, it won the second tournament -- that's known as tit for tat.
Another economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma is the ultimatum game, and it's also a very interesting probe of our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions.
Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s.
BitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader, making the system more efficient the more it is used.
You cling to your land because it is your secure place.
And through their work over the last years, this is not only happening that this house is opening, but it's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it.
And through their work over the last years, this is not only happening that this house is opening, but it's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it.
Real security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn't exist.
It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs.
It is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness that we are all utterly inter-bended, and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere.
It was invented around the 1920s, and the inventor, Léon Theremin -- he also was a musician besides an inventor -- he came up with the idea for making the theremin, I think, when he was working on some shortwave radios.
And so somehow through developing that, he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now.
And a lot of times, even kids nowadays, they'll make reference to a theremin by going, "Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo," because in the '50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies, that sound that's like ...   It's kind of a funny, goofy sound to do.
And here's the building as it opened, with a channel overlooking downtown, and as seen from downtown.
And they shelved the project. And it sat there for 10 years, and then one day Abe Spiegel from Los Angeles, who had lost his three-year-old son at Auschwitz, came, saw the model, wrote the check and it got built 10 years later.
I'd like you to come and design it."
If it were to be anywhere in Washington, it would be an office building, a conference center, a place for negotiating peace and so on -- all of which the building is -- but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial, this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall.
The first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces -- spaces where research goes on, conference centers, a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking -- and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition, the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry.
It would take two or three thousand bombs.
The people who supported it were the Air Force, which meant that it was all secret.
The people who supported it were the Air Force, which meant that it was all secret.
So you're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion -- not like just a stick of dynamite, but you're directing it at the ship.
These are stills from film footage that was saved by someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn't, and kept it in their basement for the last 40 years.
It makes "What the Bleep Do We Know" seem like a doctoral dissertation from Harvard on quantum mechanics -- that's how bad it is.
That movie is so horrible. It promotes such awful pseudoscience.
DH: May we have our jumping music please?  May we have it a bit louder?
It's a labor of love for us and our small team, and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe.
It'll be a free download -- thank you, Craig Mundie -- and it'll be available at the website WorldWideTelescope.org, which is something new.
So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are, then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here. It's a waking dream, and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history.
But the whole point of this thing is for them to look at this chart and fill it out.
It goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine-year-olds.
Make it go in the other direction.
You know how much trouble the children have with variables, but by learning it this way, in a situated fashion, they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it.
And it was not until Galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child, only 400 years ago.
This is the front of the brain, the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down, and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head.
Information, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment smells like and tastes like, what it feels like and what it sounds like.
And it was the kind of caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me.
So I take the phone pad and I put it right here.
I take the business card, I put it right here, and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad.
Now, if you saw a picture of this as it was published in Architectural Record -- they didn't show the context, so you would think, "God, what a pushy guy this is."
Couldn't find it.
And it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made, I think.
And there is a story -- it's a real story -- about my grandmother buying a carp on Thursday, bringing it home, putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid.
I played with it in the evening.
When I went to sleep, the next day it wasn't there.
It's in perspective and everything.
It led to the building on the left.
I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture.
So he came back with a simpler building, but he put some funny details on it, and he moved it closer to my building.
In Barcelona, on Las Ramblas for some film festival, I did the Hollywood sign going and coming, made a building out of it, and they built it.
But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me.
It's kind of like a whole built town.
It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply -- it's that formed lumber from Finland.
We used it at Loyola on the chapel, and it didn't work.
We used it at Loyola on the chapel, and it didn't work.
I keep trying to make it work.
So, the centerline of this thing -- we'd preserve it, and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox, etc., that are underway.
I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end -- here you see on the photographs of the site -- slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom, which I designed like a kind of a barge, looking like a boat.
And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land -- it's 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it.
And it's got a fish.
The original building, because it was frog-like, fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well.
And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it, perverted it, into the form of the fish, and created a kind of a 19th-century contraption that looks like, that will sit -- this is the beach and the harbor out in front, and this is really a shopping center with department stores.
And the food wasn't as good as the stuff, and so it failed.
It didn't work.
And it contains 18 free parameters, OK, which we have to fit to the data.
The standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence, full of a strange kind of energy -- inflationary energy -- which blew it up.
And in this scenario, not only was the Big Bang not the beginning, as you can see from the picture, it can happen over and over again.
It's an 80-room Art Deco hotel from the 1920s.
It's a beautiful building. We decided we would refurbish it and then put out the word: we're going to start the best math institute in Africa in this hotel.
It's a beautiful building. We decided we would refurbish it and then put out the word: we're going to start the best math institute in Africa in this hotel.
My understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot.
And what we need to do is to replicate it.
All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours and an interest in the English word -- I hope to have an interest in the English language, but I'm not speaking it well right now.  I'm trying. That clock has got me.
So, we had this place, we rented it, the landlord was all for it. We did this mural, that's a Chris Ware mural, that basically explains the entire history of the printed word, in mural form -- it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road.
It used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below, acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.
We took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors, whitewashed beams and it had the look -- while we were renovating this place, somebody said, "You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship."
A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see, we made it look sort of pirate supply-like.
This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there, it goes up an electric lift and then the guy behind the counter tells you that you have to recite the vow of heroism, which you do, if you want to buy anything. And it limits, really, their sales.
This website is already up, it's already got a bunch of stories, a lot of ideas. It's called "Once Upon a School," which is a great title, I think.
It meant: "I commit myself. I engage myself."
But people want to be religious, and religion should be made to be a force for harmony in the world, which it can and should be -- because of the Golden Rule.
And then Achilles takes the body of Hector, he hands it very tenderly to the father, and the two men look at each other, and see each other as divine.
And so I do urge you to join me in making -- in this charter -- to building this charter, launching it and propagating it so that it becomes -- I'd like to see it in every college, every church, every mosque, every synagogue in the world, so that people can look at their tradition, reclaim it, and make religion a source of peace in the world, which it can and should be. Thank you very much.

The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces.
It's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first.
You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.
Set it up to around A, above A, above A. There's an A, more or less.
So, I'll put a measuring tape here, measuring tape here, move it back over to here.
So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators and try to make the music be the voice and have the animation following it?
So with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track -- many of you probably know it. It’s about 25 years old, and it's David Byrne and Brian Eno -- and we did this little animation.

So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible, which is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime of a planet of Earth type.
If it was very low, one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available.
If it was very low, one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available.
Indeed, it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge.
It's three times hotter than Mercury, which is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly, here's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images, but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate.
People say, "What's the solution?" Here it is.
Now, to close, we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine.
For those of you who aren't familiar with this device, it's a $40 video game controller.
The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all love music a great deal. It means a lot to us.
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.
So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.
And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it, but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way, and that's one of the main parts of my work.
And we started by making instruments for some of the world's greatest performers -- we call these hyperinstruments -- for Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Gabriel, Prince, orchestras, rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument, so the instrument knows how it's being played.
Guitar Hero came out of our lab, and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab are proof that if you make the right kind of interface, people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music, and playing it over and over and over again.
So, the model works, but it's only the tip of the iceberg, because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want to make music in something like Guitar Hero.
And music is very fun, but it's also transformative.
It can change the way you communicate with others, it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero.
We are very involved in education. We have a long-term project called Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive, but for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music, want to spend their time doing it, and then will demand to know how it works, how to make more, how to create. So, we make squeezy instruments, like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers,
A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called "Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book.
If you haven't seen it, it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself, and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations.

It's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things.
To get their hands on music, to shape it themselves, change it, to experiment with it, to make their own music.
To get their hands on music, to shape it themselves, change it, to experiment with it, to make their own music.
The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera, one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now.
And it's about a man, rich, successful, powerful, who wants to live forever.
Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument, like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier, but it's actually a robotic music instrument.
So, the process and the technology -- basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know, we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer.
So, in hearing this piece, as I mentioned before, the most important thing is the music's great, and it'll show you who Dan is.
It's just been industrial, which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars, and later, more for the telegraph, and the radio transmitter, and the television, and eventually the mainframe.
It's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world.
It has to support over 100 million users at any given moment. It's got to be robust to attack, including closing the main index, injecting malicious files, armed seizure of some major nodes. You'd say that would take years.
And if dinner isn't entirely obvious, think of sex.  It also requires certain new organizational approaches.
Now, take the same problem, chunk it into little modules, and motivations become trivial.
Just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning, or, in places that are more involved, like Wikipedia, gives me a certain set of social relations.
It's creating, and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition.
It's creating, and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition.
Here's the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass.
It extends opportunity to the rural centers, and we can use expertise in a very smart way.
And we designed this telemedicine solution. It's proprietary to us, and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone who is interested in doing it. You can still be profitable.
And for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay, it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to pay.
There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.
And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable in my life, and I have it. Moral ambiguity.
Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly, as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.

The book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.
It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.
It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.
Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything, and that is good, because then I will discover something new.
Now, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea, sometimes that's all it is -- bold and bizarre, but it has nothing to do with the world around us.
This particular idea, however -- although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong, and at the end I'll discuss experiments which, in the next few years, may tell us whether it's right or wrong -- this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research.
It really works. It describes the data.
And number two: does this theory really work in detail, when you try to apply it to the world around us?
It's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park -- it's kind of irrelevant -- but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint, but you and I all know that it does have some thickness.
But what about the second question that I asked: does the theory actually work when you try to apply it to the real world?
Well, it turns out that Einstein and Kaluza and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it to the physics of the universe as was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work.
So many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s, this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away.
In our era, a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicists such as myself, many others around the world, it's called superstring theory, as you were indicating.
And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions, but when we study superstring theory, we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form.
It's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy, vibrating in different frequencies.
When you study the mathematics of string theory, you find that it doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space.
It doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six.
Finally, you can study the equations, and show that it works only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space and one dimension of time.
And if the answer that we get from our calculations agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determined through detailed and precise experimentation, this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is the way it is.
The hope is that if the collision has enough energy, it may eject some of the debris from the collision from our dimensions, forcing it to enter into the other dimensions.
So as of today, it's finished. I'd like to say that I planned that for TED, but I didn't. So it's been completed as of today.
So, way back in the early times of the universe, we believe it was very simple and understandable.
Back at the start, in the first billionth of a second, we believe, or we've observed, it was very simple.
imagine a snowflake in your hand, and you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated, beautiful object. But as you heat it up, it'll melt into a pool of water, and you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made of H20, water.
imagine a snowflake in your hand, and you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated, beautiful object. But as you heat it up, it'll melt into a pool of water, and you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made of H20, water.
And, as of today, it's made of these things.
And we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.
Well, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.
Now when a particle moves through the universe, it can interact with these Higgs particles.
If it's not true -- because it's quite a convoluted mechanism, although it's the simplest we've been able to think of -- then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles we know have to turn up at the LHC.
But actually, with this theory, we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang -- absolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that, but it seems to do it.
And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful narrative -- almost a creation story, if you'd like -- about the universe, from modern science over the last few decades.
It began to expand about a million, billion, billion, billion billionth of a second -- I think I got that right -- after the Big Bang.
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen, 25 percent helium. It still is today.
It continued to expand about 300 million years.
It's completely fucked up and can only be explained in song.

It's based on a real life experience.
When I was out with my friends drinking beer, I always was very aware of those words --  -- and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course, but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible, and it can only be helpful if it's affordable.
Because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market, whether it's education or under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands incredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability, tremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges that frankly, without actually doing it, it would be very difficult to understand, and I'll explain that in just a minute.
And frankly -- and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers when I say this, but I truly mean it -- if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it, it would be very difficult to judge who made it, because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different.
In other parts, it doesn't.
In other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed and put into action in those regions.
Because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours, and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it.
It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market, not only in the developing countries, but actually in the developed regions as well, because there are parts of the United States where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient.
And notice that as the mycelium grows, it conquers territory and then it begins the net.
It inhales oxygen, just like we do.
It knows that you are there.
When you walk across landscapes, it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris.
The mycelium, in the right conditions, produces a mushroom -- it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt.
We came back to our pile, it was covered with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms, and the color changed to a light form.
They gave it to the queen.
It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.
It covers over 200,000 species.
If there's a YouTube-like site that you could put up, you could make it interactive, zip code specific -- where people could join together, and through satellite imaging systems, through Virtual Earth or Google Earth, you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes.
But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere, I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not.
It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.
All right. So, that's one way of doing it, which is five balls down.
And what do you dedicate it to, in exploring a particular thing?
I always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car, it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting.
Talking about geometry and everything, if you take the circle and you split it in half -- can you run "S-Curve music?"
And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages.
So, they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot.
In fact, when margarine was invented, several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink, so we'd all know that it was a fake.
It was sold to proto-feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework.
It wasn't all bad.
Except, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream.
In fact, I have another version at my office and I ask people, "Why are there mountains here, on this area here, but there are none over here?" And they go, "Well, gee, I don't know," saying, "Is it a fracture zone? Is it a hot spot?"
And our interest in this mountain range, as Earth scientists in those days, was not only because of its tremendous size, dominating the planet, but the role it plays in the genesis of the Earth's outer skin.
And like a living organism, you tear it open, it bleeds its molten blood, rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere, hardens, forms new tissue and moves laterally.
I remember having to use vodka -- my own vodka -- to pickle it because we don't carry formaldehyde.
We were not predicting it.
And yet we're only now penetrating it.
But certainly, it's going to be going to the unknown America.
The game is not over -- it's over by the eighth grade, it's not beginning.
You can put so much information into that mind, it's in full [receiving] mode.
And so the first projects were sort of humble, but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way, and maybe finding some new functionality.
It allows the person to switch, and to mix these two colorations.
So, we worked on this bottle, and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.
But what he said was really significant, is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product, how we were going to make it low cost, robust.
So, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic, to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.
I mean, they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is.
But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland, and he had the laptop for an afternoon, and I had to take it back. It was hard.
It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day, February 14, about 10 days ago.
And it's full of many little trivial end points, like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn't really mean anything.
And it's full of many little trivial end points, like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn't really mean anything.
So, when I started this, I didn't have an overall plan for the machine, but I did have a sense of the gesture, and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space.
So, I had this wishbone, and I thought, it's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long.
The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought, and it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair."
I had this image in my mind, when I saw my son's little chair, and I saw it explode up and out.
So, it's sort of related, but you can see it's much more overtly erotic.
So I made -- this is my first racing sculpture, and I thought, "Oh, I'm going to make a cart, and I'm going to have it -- I'm going to have my hand writing 'faster,' so as I run down the street, the cart's going to talk to me and it's going to go, 'Faster, faster!' " So, that's what it does.
Once it's perceived, and someone brings it into their own mind, then there's a cycle that has been completed.

Yes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but I think you need to see this. That's the floor, OK?
You can't stop it.
And abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good and made a good meme, an effective spreading meme.
And abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good and made a good meme, an effective spreading meme.
It's not an idea. It's not equivalent to anything else, really.
Well, you sir, you've got those glasses hung around your neck in that particularly fetching way. I wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself, or copied it from someone else?
Why? Because it's producing the memes.
Now, it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off, and maybe it nearly did, but you see, we don't know.
But maybe it nearly did.
So, here comes a bit of science, and this is a bit of science I've done since "The Bottom Billion," so it's new.
And that's great for the company, and it's quite often great for the minister --  -- and it's not great for their country.
And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third-generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth.
Just in time, a set of economists got there and said, "Why not try an auction? It'll reveal the value."
I said, "No, it's -- it's penguin shit."
So, I said, "No, no, really -- it's penguin shit."
It may not seem that, but if you were a microwave, this is how you would view it.
But, besides being intellectually and scientifically interesting, it's also very different than the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands.
And more importantly, that line between good and evil -- which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable, with them on the good side, the others on the bad side -- I knew that line was movable, and it was permeable.
If you look at it and focus on the white, what you see is a world full of angels.
It tells me something else.
And that's the key: it's about power.
And it has a lot of detail about what I'm going to talk about today.
And viewed in that light, it takes on a whole other resonance.
Now, the measure of a society is not only what it does, but the quality of its aspirations.
But if you break a gourd, you cannot simply throw it away, because every stroke of that stick that has built up that calcium, the measure of a man's life, has a thought behind it.
And yet tragically, when you now go to those northern communities, you find to your astonishment that whereas the sea ice used to come in in September and stay till July, in a place like Kanak in northern Greenland, it literally comes in now in November and stays until March.
It remains a rich topography of the spirit.
It has de-professionalized publishing.
So it opens up a whole new world, and these people saw it.
Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him.
So he designed this universe, and ran it.
Every time there was a new, fast machine, he started using it, and saw exactly what's happening now.
And he explained, in a very generous way, the spirit that brought all these different people to the Institute for Advanced Study in the '40s to do this project, and make it freely available with no patents, no restrictions, no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world.
And it's Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off.
And, as you slowly step back, you see that it's a painting by Van Gogh, called "Skull with Cigarette."
And we aren't talking about it -- we dismiss it.
The challenge of looking at nature's designs -- and I'll tell you the way that we perceive it, and the way we've used it.
Think about it. If you were an engineer and I told you that you had to build an automobile, but it had to start off to be this big, then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way.
This is a real challenge to do this, because animals, when you start to really look inside them -- how they work -- appear hopelessly complex. There's no detailed history of the design plans, you can't go look it up anywhere.
Because it's very interesting. When you take this model and you perturb it, you give it a push, as it bumps into something, it self-stabilizes, with no brain or no reflexes, just by the structure alone.

It's a beautiful model. Let's look at the mathematics.
It just bends by itself beautifully.
It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all.
We couldn't believe that it could do this. It said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple, springy legs, you could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built.

It moves in a gait that an insect uses, and here it is going on the treadmill. Now, what's important about this robot, compared to other robots, is that it can't see anything, it can't feel anything, it doesn't have a brain, yet it can maneuver over these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever.
Again, this robot can't see anything, it can't feel anything, it has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system, with very simple parts, but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal.
RF: Here's it going down a pathway.
Like if we had a piece of tape now, we'd peel it this way.
Here's the gecko running up a vertical surface. There it goes, in real time. There it goes again. Obviously, we have to slow this down a little bit.
Do you see how much it's bending like that? We can't figure that out -- that's an unsolved mystery. We don't know how it works.
It's a see-through treadmill with a see-through treadmill belt, so we can watch the animal's feet, and videotape them through the treadmill belt, to see how they move.
It can do this in 14 milliseconds. It's unbelievable.
You know, you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry, where you had these two atoms, they're close together, and the electrons are moving around. That tiny force is sufficient to allow them to do that because it's added up so many times with these small structures.
We'll see where this goes. We were so excited about this that we realized that that small-size scale -- and where everything gets sticky, and gravity doesn't matter anymore -- we needed to look at ants and their feet, because one of my other colleagues at Berkeley has built a six-millimeter silicone robot with legs. But it gets stuck. It doesn't move very well.
You let it cool to room temperature, and then, as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side, it creates a powerful cooling effect.
It topped 400 psi. The ammonia was toxic. It sprayed everywhere.
Actually, it's not really an experiment, because I know the outcome.
But it's like an experiment. Now, before we start --  Before we start, I need to do two things.
-- and maybe a little bit of a march from "Aida" when you come into the hall. But otherwise, you never hear it.
But I tell you what. It doesn't work for me to go on with this thing, with such a wide gulf between those who understand, love and are passionate about classical music, and those who have no relationship to it at all.
Now, he gets to F-sharp, and finally he goes down to E, but it's the wrong chord -- because the chord he's looking for is this one, and instead he does ...
Right. He gets to E, but it's the wrong chord.
Am I sure that every single person followed that, understood it, was moved by it? Of course, I can't be sure.
If you thought, "Three percent of the population likes classical music, if only we could move it to four percent."
It's taken at three o'clock in the morning, without the permission of the company.
It's about two weeks old. There they are, folks.
This picture of Seymour -- 25 years ago. Seymour made a very simple observation in 1968, and then basically presented it in 1970 -- April 11 to be precise -- called "Teaching Children Thinking."
It's really important. Using applications is OK, but programming is absolutely fundamental.
We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight, and the more sunlight the better.
And guess what? We won it hands down.
I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.
I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it until there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window.
I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it until there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window.
And she shook her head and said, "Oh, these Americans. We gave them a language, why don't they use it?"
So, I blew it up and ran into the living room, my finger where it shouldn't have been, I was waving this buzzing sheep around, and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock.

Now, I'd been staying in this room for about three months -- it was a little 15-story Korean hotel.
It's called "Peace on Earth."
I can't go back to my area -- it's more than 1,000 kilometers [away].
That mineral has killed a lot: five millions of Congolese have gone because of this Colombo-Tantalite -- they call it Coltan -- that they use it to make cell phones and it has been in that area, all over in Congo. Extraction, and good, big business of the war.

And after the war, I have been able to bring it back home, so that we continue our studies.
With friends, we had been sitting and watching match football, and having some good music with WorldSpace radio, when it started, I think.
And every time, daily, after we have meeting, what compromise we have, whatever, I go, I write a short email, send it.
But now I think that I would have titled it, "The Language of Guns."
That stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen.
So, it's subject to gravity, has joints, etc.
If you just run the simulation, it will just collapse, like this.
The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it that actually makes it work.
At the beginning, it can't walk at all, but it will get better and better over time.
Generation 10 and it'll take a few steps more -- still not quite there.
But now, after generation 20, it actually walks in a straight line without falling over.
It was, academically, quite a challenging project, and once we had reached that stage, we were quite confident that we could try and do other things as well with this approach -- actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it.
Now, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right, which is what I'm doing now, here, it will fall over it in a completely different way.
And again, if you move the obstacle a tiny bit, it'll again fall differently.
It's got to be relatively fast, so you can run it on a normal machine, but it's got to be accurate enough, so it looks good enough, basically.
It's got to be relatively fast, so you can run it on a normal machine, but it's got to be accurate enough, so it looks good enough, basically.
So we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing, and tried to make it as realistic as possible.
It falls over, but it falls over like a rag doll, basically.
But what it will do -- I'm going to push it again.
But what it will do -- I'm going to push it again.
It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed.
It's going to stick out its hands.
I'm going to push it a bit harder now, harder than I just pushed Chris.
So, here's the same character with the same behavior I've just shown you, but now I'm just going to push it from different directions.
And now from the left -- and it falls differently.
So this character is going to be hit by a force, it's going to realize it's in the air, and it's going to try and, well, stick out its arm in the direction where it's landing.
This is something I just got last night from an animation studio in London, who are using our software and experimenting with it right now.
And my wife thought this was very offensive, so she sat in every seat in our apartment, and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around.
So, whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it's crazy -- they did a great job.
Ocean -- probably the most likely place for life to originate, just as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa, to go down through the ice, find out who is swimming around in the ocean, whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters -- whatever there may be that's exciting --- or cephalopods.
We don't know just how thick it is, probably miles thick, so it's very expensive and very difficult to go down there -- send down your submarine or whatever it is -- and explore.
So if life could be established out there, it would have all the essentials -- chemistry and sunlight -- everything that's needed.
There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa, and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years.
It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface, just as it did on the Earth.
Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years, finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great -- much greater freedom, and a much greater variety of creatures developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean.
And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy, but it happened.
Now, if life had originated on Europa in the ocean, it could also have moved out onto the surface.
The sunlight in Jupiter, on the satellites of Jupiter, is 25 times fainter than it is here, since Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun.
And then, when you shine sunlight at them, the sunlight will be reflected back, just as it is in the eyes of an animal.
Because it means that -- the way life can live out there, it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet.
And then if you run into another object, you can stay there and colonize the other object. So life will spread, then, from one object to another. So if it exists at all in the Kuiper Belt, it's likely to be very widespread. And you will have then a great competition amongst species -- Darwinian evolution -- so there'll be a huge advantage to the species which is able to jump from one place to another
But in the long run, if there's no life there, we create it ourselves.
We transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful than it is today.
It was built by the grandest Sun King, of the grandest city-state, of the grandest civilization of the Americas, the Mayas.
They've never found a society that did not have it.
We found activity in some cells called the A10 cells, cells that actually make dopamine, a natural stimulant, and spray it to many brain regions.
Romantic love is an obsession. It possesses you.
As an eighth-century Japanese poet said, "My longing had no time when it ceases."
It comes from a David Mamet play, and there's two con artists in the play, and the woman is conning the man, and the man looks at the woman and says, "Oh, you're a bad pony, I'm not going to bet on you."
And it's got the three main characteristics of addiction: tolerance, you need to see them more, and more, and more; withdrawals; and last, relapse.
Faulkner once said, "The past is not dead, it's not even the past."
I think it comes from millions of years of holding that baby in front of your face, cajoling it, reprimanding it, educating it with words.
It's deeply embedded in the brain.
The problem is the person or persons using it.
It passes so fast."
Richard Wurman: You did it.
So unlike traditional magic, it uses the power of words, linguistic deception, non-verbal communication and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense.
KB: No way to see through it? KT: No.
KB: I'll take it off.
But if I wanted you to look at my right hand, then I look at it, too.
And as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind, I'm going to take your left hand, and just place it up here.
I want you to hold it there just for a moment, and I only want you to allow your hand to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop at the same rate and speed as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness, and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop.
OK, now, allow it to stay there.
Allow it to stick firmly to the tabletop, keep your eyes closed.
Make sure it is solid, there's only one hole, and it's a normal Coke bottle.
And you can whack it against the table, if you want; be careful.
Even though it's solid, I'm standing away.
OK, and when you feel the sensation -- it might take a while -- drop it into the glass.
I knew that because my name starts with a K also, but his name doesn't start with a K, it starts with an M.
And it should be a male victim, that's the only thing.
Now you don't know where the spike is, and I don't know where it is either.
I want to say why psychology was good, why it was not good and how it may become, in the next 10 years, good enough.
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage.
It should be interested in the best things in life.
And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling, and with genius, with nurturing high talent.
The first life is the pleasant life and it's simply, as best we can find it, it's having as many of the pleasures as you can, as much positive emotion as you can, and learning the skills -- savoring, mindfulness -- that amplify them, that stretch them over time and space.
Pleasure has raw feels: you know it's happening. It's thought and feeling.
And meaning, in this view, consists of -- very parallel to eudaimonia -- it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are, and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are.
When we find a fossil, we mark it.
We mark it with a GPS fix, and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen, so we could essentially put it back on the surface, exactly where we found it.
And all the sediment is then put through these screens, and where we go again through it very carefully, looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.
And all the sediment is then put through these screens, and where we go again through it very carefully, looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.
And what was so fun about it was this: the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree, and fairly recently the tree had grown up, but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside, and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this, holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.
And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here, waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does, it throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up under the ice, and cuts it up.

They have time. When did it take place? Dates -- when did it occur?
She was wearing this silver ring that had the word "love" engraved on it, and she'd found it in the road somewhere.
Because if architecture is what I believe it to be, which is the built form of our cultural ambitions, what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?
I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way, brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time, and made it a subject for common conversation.
It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts.
It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.
It's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe, so the parts can all be cut at the same time.
They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program, and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into -- at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications -- a set of instructions for pieces of wood.
It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks.
It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas, where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.
They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks, building it, including all of the parts, manufactured.
It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting, so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face.
The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.
Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it.
So, I have a kind of a simple story, and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making, this thing that has happened in 5,000 days -- that's all these computers, all these handhelds, all these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers -- basically what we're getting out of all these connections is we're getting one machine.
It has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted.
It's just a huge machine, and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet.
We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do in the next 5,000 days -- we're going to give this machine a body.
It's wireless. It's always connected.
Right now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work, a Word document, they aren't on the Web, but they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine.
I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data.
It's going to link directly to -- it will know, the Web will be able to read itself and know that that actually is a place, and that whenever it sees that word, "Pacifica," it knows that it actually has a place, latitude, longitude, a certain population.
Why should you be doing that? You should just do that once, and it should know who all your friends are.
But what's it's doing is sharing data.
So the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better.
The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web but only better -- it's going to be something different.
And I think it's going to be smarter.
It'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.
But it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.
Secondly, it's become much more personalized.
It will know us, and that's good.
It looks more global. If you take this whole thing, it is a very big machine, very reliable machine, more reliable than its parts.
But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.
So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system, more as if this wasn't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with. It's a "One."
So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system, more as if this wasn't a large organism that we are going to be interacting with. It's a "One."
And I don't know what else to call it, than the One.
And again, I don't want to talk about consciousness, I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria, or a volvox, which is what that organism is.
To share is to gain. Let the One read it.
It shows you these cells that process information.
But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady -- it's a sporadic flow of current.
And even when you close the pore -- which neurons can do, they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity -- even when it's closed, because these ions are so small, they can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time.
And when it's closed, you have a zero, but you have a few ones thrown in.
The current will turn on and off at random, even when it's supposed to be on.
And it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless, otherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system that stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust.
And they figured out all the different cells, and they figured out the network, and we just took that network and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip.
It extracts regions with dark contrast, which will show up on the video as red.
And it extracts regions with white or light contrast, which will show up on the video as green.
And then it also extracts movement.
But it's become something else.
It's become an art form, a form of sculpture.
The common theme -- what makes it origami -- is folding is how we create the form.
You know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797.
Because what you can do is take your problem, and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved, and use their solutions.
We take an idea, combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.
I mean, a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws, it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?"
I start with my idea. I abstract it.
Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again, until it gets long and narrow, and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.
Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again, until it gets long and narrow, and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.
If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.
And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.
So, no matter how I make a flap, it needs some part of a circular region of paper.
So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.
It's free. It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.
And you just draw a stick figure, and it calculates the crease pattern.
It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern, and if you use that stick figure that I just showed -- which you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers -- you'll get this crease pattern.
And he used it to design this solar array.
It folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern -- you wouldn't even call that origami.
They called it the Eyeglass.
Whether you look up or look down, how do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket.
Well, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.
It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination, but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there, through your blood vessels.
The field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue, gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry, but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.
How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.
If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body, and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.
If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body, and you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back, thousands of times. It's a lot of information.
Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.
It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.
And it's basically a meat locker.
It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.
I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer.
And this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.
This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason in New Zealand last year, and it was submitted and published in National Geographic.
They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory, because they couldn't leave it there, because it's still valuable.
They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory, because they couldn't leave it there, because it's still valuable.
It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home, on the other.
Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.
So I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe, what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are -- at least some of the big questions.
In other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance -- this is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK -- we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases from the center of the galaxy.
If it's constant, that means that the stars out here are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see.
And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves, and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy.
I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK, to try to remind you that it's there.
Can we see it more visually? Yes, we can.
A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe for perhaps billions of years before it enters the telescope or your eye.
Well, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling as it enters our eye, right?
So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass, I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.
We shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK.
But because gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space, it tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK.
So, in the last century, OK, people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever; whether it would slow down, you know, will be slowing down, but continue forever; slow down and stop, asymptotically stop; or slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again.
So one way to look for them is to build detectors that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.
And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota, OK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days announced the most sensitive results so far.
I have a little pad to make it a little softer.
I know where the card were, then I chose it. So another person, another card.
I think I do it the same way. I like to, so I know where it is.
It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought that if you see a dog in a park, and the owner is calling it, and the owner says, you know, "Puppy, come here, come here," and the dog thinks, "Hmm, interesting.
Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy, because it prevents physical fights.
So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.
Will it do it?
So we really motivate the dog to want to do it, such that the need for punishment seldom comes up.
You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.
It doesn't have to be.
There's several definitions of what a punishment is, but one definition, the most popular, is: a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior, such that it's less likely to occur in the future.
It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.
And I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.
And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house, and they never took it outside.
And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house, and they never took it outside.
And a lot of my friends train really neat animals, grizzly bears -- if you've ever seen a grizzly bear on the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it -- killer whales. I love it because it wires you up.
This is how we go into a relationship, and it's hunky-dory for a year.
When you watch people interacting with animals or other people, there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.
And when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty.
You see it especially in the workplace, especially from boss to employee.
If it's good, say, "That was really neat, thank you."
In fact, the theme isn't even the melody, it's the bass line.
I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from, which is how it was performed.
I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from, which is how it was performed.
Booted up in a cell, the program would execute, and it could result in this person; or with a small change, it could result in this person; or another small change, this person; or with a larger change, this dog, or this tree, or this whale.
Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be.
Then you're going to have a compiler that's going to take that description and it's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed.
And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately, is it will do a developmental computation, a molecular computation, and it'll build an electronic computer.
Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place, and a right half that binds it in a different place, and brings the long strand together like this.
It feels the DNA origami.
It was started by Erik Winfree, and what it does, it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami.
It knows when to stop growing because it can count.
It knows how big it is.
So it's got some errors, but at least it counts up.
Now, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it's fewer at TED, will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people, probably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards, and say that actually, it comes out of the ground.
And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't.
What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system, to show that it's not really like that?
So, why is it blue on cloudy days? Ah, see.
But how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point.
If you have a matching grant, it's typically two or three to one.
This is what happens when you put up a prize, when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials.
You get publicity increase, and when it's won, publicity shoots through the roof -- if it's properly managed -- and that's part of the benefits to a sponsor.
You know, innovators, the entrepreneurs out there, you know that when you're going for a goal, the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself.
And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory, the velocity, you will notice, has dropped off to a minimum.
They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system, deploy it all across the frozen north, and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the Manhattan Project building the A-Bomb in the first place.
About 20 percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing, and it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes.
You saw how huge it was, and to give you a sense for this -- because we've talked a lot about Moore's law and making things small at this conference, so let's talk about making things large.
It led to lawsuits --  -- federal investigations, and lots of repercussions, and that's a scandal we won't discuss today.
You know, the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in.
A few years later, we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of, how do you get the content you want, the way you want it and the easy way?
Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians.
He wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it, and kind of only one of his ideas turned out to have been the right early idea.
And so every time a new medium arrives, the old medium is the content, and it is highly observable, highly noticeable, but the real, real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium, and it is ignored.
It's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations.
Or my grandchild, or whatever it is.
Because when people all share values, when people all share morals, they become a team, and once you engage the psychology of teams, it shuts down open-minded thinking.
When the liberal team loses, as it did in 2004, and as it almost did in 2000, we comfort ourselves.
What is morality and where does it come from?
And how will it end up being different from a kid born 60 miles south of us in Lynchburg, Virginia?
This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question.
It shoots up and it keeps going up.
If you're high in openness to experience, revolution is good, it's change, it's fun.
It's really precious, and it's really easy to lose.
Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama -- and it comes from his moral humility.
And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all.
It's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it.
It's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.
It gets up to about 150 feet long.
It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.
It's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.
It's a colonial animal.
Because we see it in bits and pieces right now.
We see it either as sound, or we see it as video, or we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors, but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.
You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here, and he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack!
It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid, and it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates.
And it was an extraordinary time, and I am going to go through some of the mentality that we -- that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing.
It was characterized by a nation-versus-nation, very fragile standoff.
It's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that.
You take it wherever you want to take it, and you can detonate it.
It was 9.8 feet long, weighed 8,800 pounds. You go down to your local rent-a-truck and for 50 bucks or so, you rent a truck that's got the right capacity, and you take your bomb, you put it in the truck and you're ready to go.
It was 9.8 feet long, weighed 8,800 pounds. You go down to your local rent-a-truck and for 50 bucks or so, you rent a truck that's got the right capacity, and you take your bomb, you put it in the truck and you're ready to go.
You have, when the blast goes off -- and by the way, if it ever comes up, don't look at it.
And what happens is -- this is -- I'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within 20 minutes, it comes straight down. Within 24 hours, lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds, and it's mostly in this particular direction -- it's going northeast.
It strip-mines carcasses, and it has amazing teeth, because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones.
Go underneath it. Go above it. Go around it.
And that will turn it into actually usable water.
But before I do, I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand, the ship of the desert. It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found, largely Mongolia and Sahara, that there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel.
Well, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it?
It is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world.
And then, there's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people.
If you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed, you can lose your guitars or your house.
So we've started to -- we've made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria.
So, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco, flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ...
If we go and put it in a couple more places, I think we'll be in good shape.
It's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'" And she said, "Well, you design a story when you make it up, it's entertainment when you tell it, and you're going to use a microphone."
Because every one of us has this desire, for once -- just once -- to tell our story and have it heard.
My thing with school lunch is, it's a social justice issue.
And I'll tell you why we need to change it, but we absolutely have to change it.
And clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage, or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away, as oil hits its peak oil, you know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should, or could, be moving food 1,500 miles before we eat it.
We really need to change it.
It's really cool.
I actually went to Toys"R"Us, got a little furry cat, ripped it apart and made this.
We did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet, won "Best Innovations" at CES, but really I kind of slowed down and said, OK, I just ... After a while, I had this old tape of this dinosaur, and I gave it to this guy, and this other guy saw it, and then people started to want to do it.
But thinking is really very straightforward: it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning, or something.
And I think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease, and then you don't have to explain.
If you're not passionate, why should anyone else be, or put money into your company if you're not passionate about it?
You'll keep my money alive and make more from it.
Finally, you're asking for my money -- not just because it's my money, but because it's me.
You walk in, the first thing you've got to do, the overall arc of your presentation, it's got to start like a rocket.
I look at the logo, and it ties it to my brain.
I don't want to know all the ins and outs, just what the heck is it?
Well, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial.
When I wrote a first draft of the book, I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments, and here are some of the reactions that I got: "Better get a security camera for your house."
A famous quotation can be found -- if you look on the web, you can find it in literally scores of English core syllabuses -- "In or about December 1910, human nature changed."
But it's very clear, looking at these syllabuses, that -- it's used now as a way of saying that all forms of appreciation of art that were in place for centuries, or millennia, in the 20th century were discarded.
The famous ones -- despotism is a good one; anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way, to do it in a radically diffused fashion; and democracy is a set of technologies, which have the effect of, in principle, diffusing the power source to a large number of people and then re-concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern, and who themselves are, in principle, authorized to govern
Now, I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room, and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war if you're talking about these issues.
Well, what I'm here to say then is, for people who are skeptical about the war, it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war there is a possibility for the government of the United States and the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts to create real forms of government that are truly democratic and also truly Islamic.
It's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass.
It reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, dew point, and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout.
It's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field, and it sits on just four very delicate columns.
It's formless, featureless, depthless, scaleless, massless, purposeless and dimensionless.
And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know, it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of.
Anyway, it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed, and so it's now a memory of an apparition, actually, but it continues to live in edible form.
The building incorporates the site, but it dispenses it in very small doses in the way that the museum is choreographed.
The building incorporates the site, but it dispenses it in very small doses in the way that the museum is choreographed.
It's Alice Tully Hall, and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building and descends several levels under the street.
It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.
[ India ] [ TB is preventable and curable, ] [ but it is mutating due to inadequate treatment. ] [ XDR-TB: ] [ extreme drug resistant tuberculosis. ] [ There is no reliable cure. ] [ Patients often die within weeks of diagnosis. ] [ 49 countries have reported XDR-TB. ] [ XDR-TB is a critical threat to global health. ] [ Extreme outbreak, suffering, affliction ] [ Extreme loss, pain, pandemic ]
It was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer, and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape.
And that's what it looked like.
It grows every year.
The game costs about 80 million dollars to make, so basically it pays for itself in about a month.
I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it.
But what I want you to do is to try to understand it.
I came across a student who's absolutely excellent at expressing himself, and this student agreed that he would not show his video to anybody until you here at TED had seen it.
I found that video very, very thought provoking, and that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see.
We had a two-and-a-half-day-old baby in the house that was ours -- we hadn't taken it from somebody else.
That is -- you know, there's no sentence that kind of conjures up that period better than that, I think, which is that you suddenly have the power to put up a picture of your dog and link to it, and somebody reading the page has the power to click on that link or not click on that link.
This is what they think about my site; it's ranked by blog authority.
And that was one of the reasons why the web wasn't quite as emergent as it could be because you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism to be able to really do interesting things.
He has this line where he says, you know, you're going to put up a link there, if you see a link, somebody decided to put it there.
But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame -- what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it.
It carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s.
But it also brought home to me the lessons which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life.
It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it.
And the British people were still upset about losing the Revolution, so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of General Washington in the only outhouse, where he'd have to encounter it.
I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church, wishing harm to others, being mean to my sisters.
In a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation, and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty, and then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed.
The fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course, which means, by definition, that it cannot be maintained.
And it describes how he feels when composing is going well.
This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky -- a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity, when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.
This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky -- a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity, when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.
But it happens in other activities.
It happens also, actually, in the most recent book I wrote, called "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical, very socially responsible.
And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities, just like a coral.
In the branch in which the sample radiates, it sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schrödinger is dead.
It's going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what's ever been done before, so we're going to get to see some new particles very soon.
So when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton, it has a total electric charge of plus one.
It's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group, E8.
It's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics.
As with any large investment, it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isn't working out.
CA: That's right. The reason it's got a few people at least excited is because, if you're right, it brings gravity and quantum theory together.
GL: No, it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape.
So what's happening is, as the shape is moving over space-time, it's twisting. And the direction it's twisting as it moves is what particle we see. So it would be -- CA: The size of the E8 shape, how does that relate to the electron?
When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape, what should it be like?
The old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman's hand, and found it, and left me alone.
And it was so successful that they made it into a movie.
It was at that moment, in that very small town of 30,000 or so, that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it.
So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.
Well, it's certainly not this one.
Because for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning, and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it.
It's not -- glamour is not something -- you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are.
It puts you into this special, special world.
The notion is that it's going to transport you, and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane, who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.
I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous because, to me, it captures the whole promise of the academic contemplative life -- but maybe that's because I went to Princeton.
And, you know, this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.
It invites us into the world but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.
It has that sense of going up and away, and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were -- particularly going down.
There is a book out in the bookstore -- it's called "Symphony In Steel," and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center.
I love doing this work, because it really gives many people new hope and new choices that they didn’t have before, and it allows us to talk about things that -- not just diet, but that happiness is not -- we're talking about the pursuit of happiness, but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions, what Aldous Huxley called the "perennial wisdom," when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people,
And what we found was that, instead of getting worse and worse, in many cases it could get better and better, and much more quickly than people had once realized.
Insurance will cover the bypass, it’ll cover the angioplasty; it won’t, until recently, cover diet and lifestyle.
The fortuneteller says, "I give smokers a discount because there’s not as much to tell."  I like this slide, because it’s a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change, and what doesn’t.
And the pain is not the problem: it’s the symptom.
What was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago?
Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down, which is good.
You’ll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less fat, and you’ll enhance your health rather than harming it.
This is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density of information, but it has been pretty good for showing a lot of other things about information technology -- computers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve, and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these.
I think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically, it's achievable; economically, it's achievable; politically, it means sort of the habits, institutions of people -- it's impossible.
Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job, and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature.
Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance -- in effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble and launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.
Paul MacCready: If we could have the second video, the one-minute, put in as quickly as you can, which -- this will show the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii, and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it had just flown to 71,530 feet -- higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown.
PM: We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet while the plane is flying. And it's exploring without polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal: the stratosphere, the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth and permits life on earth to be the success that it is -- probing that is very important. And also we consider it as a sort of poor man's stationary satellite, because it can stay right overhead for months at a time,
Matt Keenan: It's switched on.
MK: All right, we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in.
It never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake, you don't leave any progeny.
Imagine taking the same material, but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker.
And we were showing him the same gel magnet that you're holding in your hand -- and you know, we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face: Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder; he opens it up and Keith and I look in, and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on.
Because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now.
KS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this, and they asked us, when's it coming out?
So I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out, just the concept is.
KS: So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal, it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube.
ZK: Now, our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole, and I have it right here in my pocket.
And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates 25 times faster than water.
Shape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil, and it holds its place. Contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back.
So, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper.
Marcus: It feeds my mind and my soul.
Again, this was my -- this was me talking about -- this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom, and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say, what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?
Ezra: They give us the special drugs. We call it bubbles.
War is a crime, yes, but I did not start it.
And in a two-dimensional world, we do know about the third dimension but we don’t use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against gravity.
This planet has an inner atmosphere of water; it’s its inner atmosphere. It has two atmospheres -- a lesser, outer gaseous atmosphere, a lighter one.
The water had started coming back. It was foaming over the reef.
We think this boat is going to Phuket hospital, but if it's too dangerous to land at its pier, then perhaps it will go to Krabi instead, which is more protected.
The first one is, What does it tell us about our ideas, about what motivates people to do things?
It would be somewhere probably within three and five percent of the number of beans in the jar, and it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you.
It is something more than that.
It is, as Steven Johnson has talked about, an emergent phenomenon.
And that phenomenon of piling on the existing links is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere, particularly of the political blogosphere, and it is one that essentially throws off this beautiful, decentralized, bottom-up intelligence that blogs can manifest in the right conditions.
When we talk about bottom-up, decentralized phenomena, the ant colony is the classic metaphor, because, no individual ant knows what it's doing, but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions.
And I got in my sailboat, sailed all the way through the Caribbean -- it wasn't really my sailboat, I kind of worked on that boat -- got to Venezuela and I started walking.
I need you to turn that piece of paper over; you should find that it’s blank on the other side.
So we might have a wild idea, but we’re afraid to share it with anybody else.
They just quite happily show their masterpiece to whoever wants to look at it.
Now, our big symbol at IDEO is actually not so much the place, it’s a thing.
And it’s actually something that we invented a few years ago, or created a few years ago.
It’s a toy; it’s called a "finger blaster."
Now, an adult encountering a new situation -- when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can, you know.
Construction play -- it’s playful, obviously, but also a powerful way to learn.
And also, the amazing thing about this video -- as soon as you see it you immediately project yourself into that experience.
Play has rules, especially when it’s group play.
I will show it to you.
If you dress it up with atoms, hydrogen atoms -- that’s what it looks like when you have it on your computer -- but actually it’s sort of more like this, in the sense that the atoms have a certain sphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel.

Why doesn’t it smell of potatoes or violets? Well, there are really two theories.
Enzymes that chew things up, antibodies, it’s all, you know, the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing, in this case a smell.
You have a molecule coming in, it gets into the protein, which is schematic here, and it causes this thing to switch, to turn, to move in some way by binding in certain parts.
Like, at no concentration, even pure, you know, if you smelt pure ethanol, it doesn’t smell of rotten eggs.
And it really does have the same -- if you calculate, if you measure the vibrational frequencies, they are the same as S-H.
Now, does it smell of sulfur? Well, if you go back in the literature, there’s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone alive then or since, Alfred Stock, he synthesized all of them.
So we call it a relational universe.
The first is that the movement, such as it is, stops at America's borders. It is not a global movement.
So this movement, if it's to be durable and global, will have to cross borders, and you will have to see other citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide, but actually making it such.
Why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering?
How Sisyphean this task was of mending, and yet aware of that complexity, humbled by it, he wasn't paralyzed by it.
It does not come for me from research.
I don't know where it comes from.
Actually, I read this great quote the other day, which was, "Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die."
I forgot that I said that. But it's really true.
I want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last goodbye.
So who would think that it was low-fat?
So you see, on the bottom, that rocket was supposed to go upward; somehow it ended going sideways.
And that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while there are dust devils which come by on Mars, as you are seeing here, and when the dust devil comes over the Rover, it just cleans it up.
Video: Now, if there is life, the Dutch will find it.
As I said earlier, it looked very much like Earth, so you see sand dunes.
It probably gets about room temperature.
EB: Now the spacecraft actually has to decide when it's going to get rid of its parachute.
LC: So it's in a free-fall, but it's also trying to use all of its actuators to make sure that it's in the right position to land.
EB: And then it has to light up its engines, right itself, and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely.
EB: We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft so that it can land itself safely.
So just imagine: you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still has to work.
So just imagine: you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor and it still has to work.
And somehow, through some dynamic effect, we're having these geysers which are being, you know, emitted from it.
Now, another satellite also attracted a lot of attention, and that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting, it's a satellite bigger than our moon, and it has an atmosphere.
Now, methane gets people all excited, because it's organic material, so immediately people start thinking, could life have evolved in that location, when you have a lot of organic material.
It's called "Tidying Up Art" and it's, as you can see, it's more or less a picture book.
It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.
It's a picture by Paul Klee.
It's more economical and also more efficient.
It's called "Untitled" and I think that's appropriate.
And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future.
Then you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet, put it in your office and you can make a living doing it.
And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.
And when I returned it looked like this.
This is a picture by Rene Magritte, and I'd like you all to inwardly -- like in your head, that is -- to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.
Yeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way.
Here I just brought it back to its original state.
And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.
Here's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever, because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones.
Here's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever, because they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones.
This place is remote. It's over 200 miles from any major city.
So last June, the Long Now board, some staff and some donors and advisors, made a two-week expedition to the mountain to explore it and investigate, one, if it's the right mountain, and two, if it's the right mountain, how it might actually work for us.
It starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey.
January 7003. There it is.
The wood is so solid it's like stone, and it lasts for a long time.
Now, if you guys have a pine cone handy, now's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it, especially on the end.
OK, onto the mines. The first asking price for the property when we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines.
All you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars."
This is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it.
But it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line, due east into the range, into very interesting territory -- except that, as you'll see when we go inside in a minute, we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale.
In fact, it was the highest-operating mine in Nevada, and it ran year round.
It's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon.
You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain.
The harder it is to get to, the more people will value it."
And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley, because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on, and there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition, and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park,
The clock experience should be profound, but from the outside it should be invisible.
It's only about 12 feet deep, but what if it were deepened from inside?
It has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs.
And it's expanding.
And he had nine days to make it.
I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology, look at the Nigerian model, make their films, create jobs, create a narrative for the population, something to identify, something positive, something that really is psychological relief and it's part of the culture.
I really think it goes both ways.
How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped, and so forth?
We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study, and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine, in a certain sense.
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it.
The beginning of time is funny -- it's on the outside, right?
And we go through a period of accelerating expansion, and the universe expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent, then to the Dark Ages, and then the first stars turn on, and they evolve into galaxies, and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies.
And it's maturing up to the present time.
It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on.
It should be called invisible matter, but the dark matter we've made visible.
It's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter, it's got photons and it's got neutrinos, which don't play much role in the later part of the universe.
And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is, and you can see what it looks like.
So we have a model, and we can calculate it, and we can use it to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like.
But now we have a new situation, really what people call an asymmetric situation, where technology is so powerful that it extends beyond a nation-state.
If people want to use it in their labs for working on research, just reconstruct it yourself, because, you know, it might break in FedEx.
If people want to use it in their labs for working on research, just reconstruct it yourself, because, you know, it might break in FedEx.
And it's only in retrospect, after the better software comes along, and you take it and you run it on a ten-year-old machine, you say, God, the machine was that fast?
It's a strange place inside a nanotube.
The whole green dream -- because it can be profitable.
But Tamiflu -- the virus is resistant. It is resistant to Tamiflu.
If we let an unlimited amount of power loose, then we will -- a very small number of people will be able to abuse it.
But it wouldn't have to be approved by regulators; you'd have to convince an actuary that it would be safe.
We may not be able to stop it, but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem.
We may not be able to stop it, but the likelihood that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem.
It was outlawed in Chicago for a while.
It's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu, you risk being attacked.
More grain in a couple of weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime.
It is fatty, it's sweet, it's silky, it's unctuous.
He rewired it. He invented it.
He let it go to seed, he took the seeds, he planted it on his 30 acres, all around.
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce.
It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze.
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well: to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements.
The average lifespan’s more than doubled since 1840, and it’s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day.
It’s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma, which is just Alzheimer’s disease of the eye.
You can see the range of the Coast Redwoods. It's here, in red.
To us, when we look at a Redwood tree, it seems to be motionless and still, and yet Redwoods are constantly in motion, moving upward into space, articulating themselves and filling Redwood space over Redwood time, over thousands of years.
It dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast, and was discovered in 1998.
It's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the Mississippi River, and yet it's only a minor feature on Chronos.
Redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space, and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk, going back into the main trunk and fusing with it.
If we had Redwood-like biology, if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm then we could just, you know, extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off.
because I had built it -- we want to buy that land and raze it and put houses on it. And I sold it to them -- I mean, we transferred ownership and they had a big party and blew up the entire building.
There is no attempt to structure the experience, to make it utopian in that sense that we put into it.
I didn't talk about it, but it's a critical feature.
I didn't talk about it, but it's a critical feature.
I think generally, we were talking about this -- I think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it, being -- surviving there, having a good life there, so to speak, is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it, because of the languages, because of the entrepreneurial richness of it, the sort of flea market nature, if you will, of the virtual world today.
It's produced to get sulfur out of gasoline -- which I find is somewhat ironic.
And the key to all of this is to make it affordable, to make it exciting, to get it on a pathway where there's a way to make money doing it.
And we want to be the first one to create it, Chris.
It'll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Show in Greenwich Village in New York City -- that's open to the public, definitely invite you all to come and attend -- it's a fantastic show.
This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow.
It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world, and still played in the Southern mountains.
It was hard on the cats, but it made a great little instrument.
It sounds something like this.
But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar, but my mother would never let us cash it.
And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can.
It was a few years ago, but I sort of remembered this story, and I told it at a concert.
Break it off, put it on your finger, and slide into the notes.
We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew, it flared up. Ah, it was great.
They said, we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel.
She came home, she took that chemistry set away, and we never saw it again.
But we thought of it often, because every time she'd cook tuna surprise it made -- tasted faintly of gunpowder.
When drum machines were new, I got to thinking, why couldn't you take the oldest form of music, the hambone rhythms, and combine it with the newest technology?
We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.
After that, it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in, kind of, a mangle.
And then finally it was prepared for the throwing.
And if we look at the history of lawns, it's actually rather tragic.
These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants, or insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that -- and we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine, this companion you can have as it matures and as it has these different fragrances.
The room is a theatre. It changes colors.
It’s designed like an Escher print.
And once we create new patterns in this brain, once we shape the brain in a new way, it never returns to its original shape.
It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy.
And it arrived, and it was tiny.
And then I took a bite, and I wished that it was tinier, because Kobe beef is so rich.
I almost couldn't finish it.
It has 360-degree views.
It has four balconies.
It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.
It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.
It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from.
It tasted fine. It tasted interesting.
It was very green, it was very peppery.
But in the blind taste test, it came in last.
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans, and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings then go through the forest collecting the, you know, results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form.
And then I tasted it, and it, you know, had this kind of unctuous, porty richness, which is characteristic of that wine -- that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways.
And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is, and I also want to explain to you why it is that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference.
Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars, but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me, most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars,
Now, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses, but in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.
Now, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses, but in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.
Here's a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it's now on sale for 1,600.
Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story: $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars, so you decide to mull it over for a week.
By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone -- the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.
Why? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500 for something that was 700 last week.
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it?
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars, but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.
They can't imagine buying it for twice the price when, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off.
Talk more about it.
DG: It's out-sized. I mean, look.
CA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event -- that it's so spectacular?
Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders?
CA: I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it?
It's not making headlines, it's not making news, it's not flashy.
I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills -- I work on aging -- and I'm interested in doing something about it, as we'll all hear tomorrow.
I very much resonate with what you're saying, because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice?
And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective, to try to then think about the way our planet behaves, as a planet, and with the life that's on it.
It's going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it.
It's going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it.
I think it's there, and I think we need to go look for it, and I think it's underground.
How do you know it when you find it?
Because if it's big and obvious, we would've already found it -- it would've already bitten us on the foot, and it hasn't.
Because if it's big and obvious, we would've already found it -- it would've already bitten us on the foot, and it hasn't.
So, we know that it's probably quite cryptic.
Very critically, how do we protect it, if we find it, and not contaminate it?
And also, even perhaps more critically, because this is the only home planet we have, how do we protect us from it, while we study it?
So why might it be hard to find?
Well, it's probably microscopic, and it's never easy to study microscopic things, although the amazing tools that we now have to do that allow us to study things in much greater depth, at much smaller scales than ever before.
But it's probably hiding, because if you are out sequestering resources from your environment, that makes you yummy, and other things might want to eat you, or consume you.
If I were to take a swab off your teeth and plate it on a Petri plate, within about four or five hours, I would have to see growth.
It's bursting with life.
It's 115 miles of mapped passage, it's pristine, it has no natural opening and it's a gigantic biological, geo-microbiological laboratory.
Now, my view of what the current status of potential life on Mars is that it's probably been on the planet, maybe one in two chances.
Did life start here and was it transported there?
Did it start there and get transported here?
It extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos.
I mean, I'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong -- it's not.
For a long time, biologists were puzzled by this behavior, wondering how it could be possible.
And for a long time, even after it was documented, it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion.
Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it, or, you know, a human being's tendency to see patterns where there are none.
All right, so, I've got a metronome, and it's the world's smallest metronome, the -- well, I shouldn't advertise.
I've set it on the fastest setting, and I'm going to now take another one set to the same setting.
Now, everyone was very excited to try it out.
Man: It really started moving sideways and slightly up and down, rather like being on the boat.
We'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge, and we'd analyzed it, we'd checked it to codes -- to heavier loads than the codes -- and here it was doing something that we didn't know about.
Interviewer: Well, at last the simulated bridge is finished, and I can make it wobble.
AM: It captures a lot of the physics, yes.
You can't help it. You're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step, and therefore to drive it to move further.
The change is absolutely monumental, because it's not just opening it up, but it's opening it up to the rest of the world.
And Americans love their Chinese food so much, they've actually brought it into space.
He has marched so far, actually, that the chef who originally invented the dish doesn't recognize it; he's kind of horrified.
The Chinese have their own version of broccoli, called Chinese broccoli, but they've now discovered American broccoli, and are importing it as a sort of exotic delicacy.
Because it doesn't look like Chinese food to them.
She's like, "It's not? But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy."
She's like, "It's not? But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy."
Someone's like, "It's sweet, it's fried, it's chicken -- Americans will love this."
It was called -- it was called "The Air Pump," or something like "The Leviathan and The Air Pump."
It was a real weird book about the 17th century.
I mean, you want to call it Godless, you know, you call it Godless.
Like he did one with -- he had a little wheel, like a fan, that was sort of loosely attached, so it could spin by itself.
They send it out for amateur rocketeers, and it said in there do not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar.
You sort of -- now you say, well, let's see if I can get hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar, perchlorate and sugar, and heat it; it would be interesting to see what it is they don't want me to do, and what it is going to -- and how is it going to work.
And they got involved in it, and the scientific and industrial establishment was born, and out of that came a lot of scientists who were in there for the money, you know, because it was suddenly available.
I mean, if you actually measure the temperature over a period -- I mean, the temperature has been measured now pretty carefully for about 50, 60 years -- longer than that it's been measured, but in really nice, precise ways, and records have been kept for 50 or 60 years, and in fact, the temperature hadn't really gone up.
So if you just average that and the daytime temperature, it looks like it went up about .7 degrees in this century.
So -- and Arrhenius' theory -- and all the global warmers think -- they would say, yeah, it should go up in the daytime, too, if it's the greenhouse effect.
They say, if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere, it isn't going up -- it's not going up at all. We've doing it very carefully now for 20 years, from satellites, and it isn't going up.
we know how much that is -- it falls on the earth, the earth gives back a certain amount.
So the theory's kaput -- it's nothing.
So the planet is a pretty amazing thing, you know, it's big and horrible -- and big and wonderful, and it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about.
You'd buy that thing, you'd bring it home, you'd plug it in, and it would do absolutely nothing at all.
You'd buy that thing, you'd bring it home, you'd plug it in, and it would do absolutely nothing at all.
So, you had to program it, and there were great programming, like, tutorials, like this.
The torture was good. Wasn't it good torture?
It was just life-changing, you know. And so, in my life, you know, I was in the tofu; it was a family business.
I found this book. It's called, "Thoughts on Design," by a man named Paul Rand.
It's a little slim volume; I'm not sure if you've seen this.
It's a very nice little book. It's about this guy, Paul Rand, who was one of the greatest graphic designers, and also a great writer as well.
So, she wears the disk, and reads the data off the sectors of the disk, and the computer starts up; it sort of boots up, really.
This was a moment where I was thinking about, so, you have a computer program, it responds to motion -- X and Y -- and I realized that each computer program has all these images inside the program.
It's about how to make it more humane again.
It's about how to make it more humane again.
Dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace, an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it.
You want to measure it by diversity?
We called this bird Sinornis. It's a little bit more advanced than Archaeopteryx, and if you go to different layers, you find things that are less advanced than Archaeopteryx, and every grade in between, so that if you find something today, we're usually splitting hairs -- or, more appropriately, feathers -- as to decide whether it's actually a non-avian or an avian.
This is sort of a look at the skull, and it's an absolutely fantastic thing about five or six inches long.
It's bird-like and hollow.
It turns out to have a forebrain one-fifteenth the size of a human.
This is the first skeleton from a southern continent, and guess what? You start preparing it.
Paul Sereno: Let's get this tape measure on him. Put it right there.
It carves up the history of life, and gives us the differences that we see in the dinosaur world towards the end, right before the bolide impact.
The FAA, the controlling body above all, calls it a "powered lift aircraft."
It makes use of the GPS -- you're familiar with GPS in your automobile, but you may not be familiar with the fact that there's a GPS U.S., there's a Russian GPS, and there's a new GPS system going to Europe, called Galileo.
Or it's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system.
A very unique engine -- it's round, it's small, it's vibration-free.
It fits exactly where we need to fit it, right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system -- very critical. In fact that engine -- for those who are into the automobile -- know that it recently is applied to the RX8 -- the Mazda.
The computers back up each other. There's a voting system -- if one computer is not agreeing with the other three, it's kicked out of the system.
And the reason that that was the model of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet -- it wasn't the 16th century -- and everybody had to dimension a building in terms of fractions, so a room would be dimensioned as one-fourth of a facade; the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as 10 units, and you would get down to the small elements
My hero is actually not Darwin; it's a guy named William Bateson, father of Greg Bateson, who was here for a long time in Monterey.
When I first saw this image, 10 years ago, I actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time.
Beautiful, because it has symmetry.
Basically what we can do, is just cut a graphite mold, put it in an oven, heat it to 1,000 degrees, gently inflate titanium that's soft, and then explode it at the last minute into this form.
I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam and I recognized, you know, the big story from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores, it's what's out on the streets, and maybe it's self-explanatory, but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism, that's preserved its kind of architecture and character, and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights
And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge -- I love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally -- and it was a bit of a disappointment, because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use.
And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge -- I love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally -- and it was a bit of a disappointment, because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use.
But there were lots of other things going on in this area: it was a kind of construction zone; a lot of buildings were going up.
It takes your attention; it has a great amount of emotion; it stares back at you the way that a figure might.
Red can be comical: it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in Havana.
But it also reminded me of the power of pattern and repetition to make an effect in our mind.
And I thought that if pattern can unite these disparate elements, it can do just about anything.
And it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity, reflective of diversity, and I think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the U.S.
Of the five senses, vision is the one that I appreciate the most, and it's the one that I can least take for granted.
Or even the people who actually pulled it off, the people at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Boston, who just would sketch out these structures of what would eventually become a worldwide network, and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's -- on Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts, just two miles from where I was studying the Queen's Gambit Deferred
It's mainly starch, and starch, when you break it down -- what is starch? It's -- thank you -- sugar, yes.
We're going to try this at lunch, and I'll explain a bit more about it, but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs -- this attempt, again, at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened.
We're going to try this at lunch, and I'll explain a bit more about it, but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs -- this attempt, again, at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened.
The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars, creating carbon dioxide and alcohol -- essentially it's burping and sweating, which is what bread is.
And somehow, this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food, and we're going to explore that in a minute.
We, after it's fermented and it's developed, started to develop flavor and character, we divide it into smaller units.
We, after it's fermented and it's developed, started to develop flavor and character, we divide it into smaller units.
And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape, and it goes into the oven -- stage 10.
We harvest the wheat, and in harvesting it, we kill it.
Now, wheat is alive, and as we harvest it, it gives up its seeds.
Now, wheat is alive, and as we harvest it, it gives up its seeds.
It's not only been killed, but it's been denied any potential for creating future life.
So we turn it into flour.
In stage one, we weigh it.
In stage two, we add water and salt to it, mix it together, and we create something that we call "clay."
And we know it's alive because in stage three, it grows. Growth is the proof of life.
And while it's growing, all these literal transformations are taking place.
Yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol.
And then we divide it, and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units, and each of those units are given shape by the baker.
It's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough -- a few people do, I think, but not too many.
But dough is what we're working with, and we take that dough to the oven, and it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of 140 degrees, it passes what we call the "thermal death point."
The yeast, whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough, to enliven it, to vivify it, in order to complete its mission, which is also to turn this dough into bread, has to give up its life.
It's starting to make sense to me -- what goes in is dough, what comes out is bread -- or it goes in alive, comes out dead.
It's used as a symbol for transformation.
And the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep in the hot, Egyptian sun, and it turned into bread.
We'll start a little piece here, and I'm going to take a little piece here -- I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch.
It's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us.
But grind it, roast it, package it, put it on a grocery store shelf, and now it'll cost five, 10, 15 cents, when you treat it as a good.
But grind it, roast it, package it, put it on a grocery store shelf, and now it'll cost five, 10, 15 cents, when you treat it as a good.
It was only then that I realized it was simply a gate that I was coming into.
It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive.
He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do.
It's not a matter of teaching it; in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they can't quantify it: it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design, but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter.
So it tends to get discounted.
But I decided I liked this contents page -- I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it.
But I decided I liked this contents page -- I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it.
It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever, but it's a nice spread, I think, in there.
But anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD, and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape, and it's ready. I think I'm ready. So.
I've taken one shot; I cropped it a few different ways.
And the point of this magazine was to read the articles, listen to the music, and try to interpret it.
You could -- you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something: it is the actual article.
I suppose you could eventually decode it, but it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile.
I suppose you could eventually decode it, but it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile.
It did not let up.
In this case, it was picking up bones and creating a tool, using it as a tool, which meant that apes just, sort of, running around and eating and doing each other figured out they can make things if they used a tool.
It is the program. It is the code of life.
Well, there it is. It is a long, long series of these base pairs.
They now are understanding, and the work is going on, exactly how this plant works, and we have the capability to know, to read that entire code and understand how it ticks.
Knowing that we can read it, knowing that we can write it, change it, maybe write its genome from scratch. So, what do you do?
It's in there, waiting to be sequenced.
Here it is: "This Island Earth."
Our planet is a good planet because it can keep water.
Earth, if we're lucky enough -- if it doesn't get hit by a Hale-Bopp, or gets blasted by some supernova nearby in the next seven billion years -- we'll find under your feet.
This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions because it did is inherently anti-Gaian.
So, I really suspect there's an alternative, and that life does actually try to do itself in -- not consciously, but just because it does.
And here's the weapon, it seems, that it did so over the last 500 million years.
It goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35, and comes out of this perfectly fine.
The Indo-European root of the word hope is a stem, K-E-U -- we would spell it K-E-U; it's pronounced koy -- and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from.
But what it means in the original Indo-European is a change in direction, going in a different way.
I'll tell you. It'll be saved by the human spirit.
It comes initially from the Latin patior, to endure, or to suffer.
And it was the hardest invention I ever made, but it got me started, and I got really lucky after that.
Light came out of it in every direction.
Before the light bulb was invented, people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it, focus it a little bit; put lenses in front of it, focus it a little bit better.
You turn on the loudspeaker, and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets, the sound just kind of goes where it wants.
For instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie, you get to watch it for free; when you want to hear the sound, you pay.
I have been really lucky with this technology: all of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.
I have been really lucky with this technology: all of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.
We've been selling it since about last September, October, and it's been immensely gratifying.
If you're interested in what it costs -- I'm not selling them today -- but this unit, with the electronics and everything, if you buy one, is around a thousand bucks.
Here's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow.
It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure.
Well, if I turn up the amplitude too much, I'm having an effect on the pressure, which means during the making of that sine wave, the speed at which it is propagating is shifting.
Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite: it's 100 percent based on non-linearity.
Instead of being made on the face of the cone, it's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air, and so when I aim it towards you, what you hear is made right next to your ears.
I said we can shorten the column, we can spread it out to cover the couch.
Turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear.
Because the sound is made in the air along this column, it does not follow the inverse square law, which says it drops off about two thirds every time you double the distance: 6dB every time you go from one meter, for instance, to two meters.
AM: Well, for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio -- it might have given it away -- I'm a double amputee, and I was born without fibulas in both legs.
Like, I almost came out of it, in front of, like, 5,000 people.
I mean, the fact that I set my sights, just a year and three months before, on becoming an Olympic athlete and saying, "Here's my life going in this direction -- and I want to take it here for a while, and just seeing how far I could push it."
I'm like, "Get it off! Don't worry about it, you know.
But without having the silicon sock, I'm just going to try slip in it.
It's pretty clean. If you're healthy, you're pretty healthy.
Now we're using this chip. And what are we using it for?
In fact, it's not even really sequenced that much.
No one would even consider it, because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure.
Prostate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it: third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.
It's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new; no one's ever seen it before.
It's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new; no one's ever seen it before.
Its closest relative is, in fact, from mice, and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus, because it's infecting a species other than mice.
And this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses.
Is it really in the tissue? And I'll end up with this: yes.
It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen.
I'll quickly play a short part of the air, and then I'm going to get into kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult to play when you're not warmed up, so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it anyway. It's called The Banks.
The Cape Breton piano playing is just awesome. It's very rhythmic and, you'll see it.
My mom plays piano, and she learned to play before they had a piano at home in Cape Breton. Before Mom's family had a piano in Cape Breton, she learned to play the rhythms on a piece of board, and the fiddlers would all congregate to play on the cold winter's evenings and Mom would be banging on this board, so when they bought a piano, they bought it in Toronto and had it taken
It became the only piano in the region, and Mom said she could basically play as soon as the piano arrived, she could play it because she had learned all these rhythms. Anyway, we found the piano last year and were able to bring it back home. We purchased it.

Some people even say it takes more energy to make a solar cell than it will give out in its entire life.
But right now, you pretty much have to take silicon, put it in an oven at 1600 degrees Fahrenheit for 17 hours, to make the cells.
It's this non-tracking collector with these six tuba-like horns, and each of them collect light in the following way -- if the sunlight strikes right here, it might bounce right to the center, the hot spot, directly, but if the sun is off-axis and comes from the side, it might hit two places and take two bounces.
James Watt didn't actually invent the steam engine, he just refined it.
He added new linear motion guides to the pistons, he added a condenser to cool the steam outside the cylinder, he made the engine double-acting so it had double the power.
And the hot air engine also was not invented by Robert Stirling, but Robert Stirling came along in 1816 and radically improved it.
This engine, because it was so interesting -- it only worked on air, no steam -- has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years that use the Stirling engine principle.
But after the Stirling engine, Otto came along, and also, he didn't invent the internal combustion engine, he just refined it.
He showed it in Paris in 1867, and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up.
He showed it in Paris in 1867, and it was a major achievement because it brought the power density of the engine way up.
So, because it went into mass production, costs were reduced, 100 years of refinement, emissions were reduced, tremendous production value.
And then when the air comes back after it's been cooled it picks up that heat again.
When the sun comes out in the morning, the petals will seek the sun, find it by searching for the highest temperature About a minute and a half or two minutes after the rays are striking the hot cap the engine will be warm enough to start and then the engine will generate electricity for about six and a half hours a day -- six and a half to seven hours as the sun moves across the sky
You don't have to use the hot water, it will cool itself.
It could be on your roof, or in your backyard, or somewhere else.
It's been pounded for a billion years with a lot of energy to make it have all that energy contained in it.
Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.
A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.
1945, it's still most places.
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.
And so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries, it doesn't get much investment.
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.
And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now to people with a better education.
And it's a system with very high turnover.
Now, we put a lot of money into education, and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.
I said, "Well, it's so persuasive, because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage, and since most people are so suspicious of garages, and know that they're going to be ripped off, they use the word 'reliable.' But everybody says they're reliable.
It's not folded, that's a photograph and it's cut on the diagonal.
And here, a very peculiar poster because, simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer, it won't sit still in the space.
At times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front, and then it shifts.
And if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience.
The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea -- was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city's subway system so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster, all of which had a different idea of what art is.
My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster, in case you don't get it.
Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting, and they make people less likely to do it.
"Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street, but I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine."
Paying attention to what we do, to how we do it, and, perhaps most importantly, to the structure of the organizations within which we work, so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed.
And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working and wasn't, and where it was in the phase.
So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer.
You can freeze half its heart. It regrows.
You can freeze half the brain. It regrows.
We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it.
Whatever it is, a fraction of one percent is not enough.
We, all of us, are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from.
It's making silicon as important as aluminum, and we'll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach 350 for more sensitivity and leveraging Moore's law for more processing capability.
It may be hard for your eye to see it, but it's easily found with our efficient algorithms.
Hopefully it won't stutter.
And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.
You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that.
The throwaway society cannot be contained -- it has gone global.
We have to throw it away.
The solution, Moore says, is to stop the plastic at its source: stop it on land before it falls in the ocean.
The solution, Moore says, is to stop the plastic at its source: stop it on land before it falls in the ocean.
If you look at this diagram of a coral reef, we know a lot about that part up near the top, and the reason we know so much about it is scuba divers can very easily go down there and access it.
Now the one thing that I forgot to mention, is that to obviate the problem of the nitrogen narcosis -- all of those blue dots in our body -- you remove the nitrogen and you replace it with helium.
Now helium's a gas, there're a lot of reasons why helium's good, it's a tiny molecule, it's inert, it doesn't give you narcosis.
Alright, closed-circuit rebreather -- what is it about it that makes it different from scuba, and why is it better?
It's a breathing loop because you breathe off of it, and it's a closed loop, and you breathe the same gas around and around and around.
There's a chemical filter in there that pulls the carbon dioxide out of the breathing gas -- so that, when it comes back to us to breathe again, it's safe to breathe again.
It's extremely clear water, because there's hardly any plankton.
And the reason this photograph is extraordinary is because it captures a moment in the very last minute of a person's life.
I wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers.
When I got comfortable in the space, it also felt like a big playground.
It lasted about five years.
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.
This particular tunnel is interesting because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum, which was demolished in 1890 when Columbia moved in.
This children's hospital was closed in 1997; it's located in Newark.
The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well, and put a Twitter feed on the front page, and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross used it to dispense news and updates as well.
Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium: you send one message and it goes out to everybody, and you receive the messages you're interested in.
So, this syntax, the "@username" that Shaquille O'Neal's using here to reply to one of his fans, was completely invented by users, and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular and then we made it easier.
We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software that can send Twitter updates -- interfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry -- as well as things like a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks or a plant Twitter when it needs water.
And they tapped into the fact that, if you have millions of people around the world talking about what they're doing and what's around them, you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event while it's going on.
This is another way that our mind was shifted, and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was.
Some users figured out that they would Twitter when they found gas -- where it was, and how much it cost -- and then appended the keyword "#atlgas" which let other people search for that and find gas themselves.
In the research phase of the project at Interval, we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research, and these people -- Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland -- changed my mind entirely about what market research was and what it could be.
It exudes [unclear]-like compounds from the roots.
And after eight years they might actually yield some timber -- that is, if you can preserve it in the right way, which we can do with bamboo peels.
So we plant it later, along the waterways to filter the water, provide the raw products just in time for when the timber becomes available.
And you need the local people for that because these grasslands, once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall -- going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there.
That means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light, it can store more carbon in the system, it can provide more functions.
This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water; it's 80 percent surrounded by seawater, and we have now a lot of intrusion there.
And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees -- you have the shade trees planted in year one, then you underplanted with the sugar palms, and you plant this thorny fence.
But whatever you do in that program, it has to be fully supported by the people, meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local, cultural values.
You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt -- that it's transparent.
Scenes of forest destruction, forest harvesting and forest fragmentation, thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has when it is not disturbed by humans.
It's a 265 million dollar industry and it's increasing rapidly.
It's only a couple dozen square miles. It's in the Rockies.
My role on the show, for those of you who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple.
Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up.
And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun that was just coming over the Rockies, it was very -- it was, it was impressive.
And he pulled it toward him, like so, and he took the knife and he put it on the tip.
He snips it, throws the tip over his shoulder, and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward, and then his head dips down, obscuring my view, but what I hear is a slurping sound, and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall and I am not even kidding.
Melanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post, band goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum.
Gets up, walks to the corner, it's quivering, and it lies down and it's in obvious distress.
And I was especially reminded of what an ridiculously short straw I had that day because now I had to do what Albert had just done, and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen, and suddenly this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno, and I'm like ...  Melanie picks up the lamb, puts it on the post, opens it up.
Albert instructs, "Push it way up there."
"Push it further."
Matt Froind, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut, who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk, if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots.
I formed a theory, and I'm going to share it now in my remaining two minutes and 30 seconds.
It goes like this -- we've declared war on work, as a society, all of us.
We didn't set out to do it and we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way, but we've done it.
It's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house -- but I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice.
It's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house -- but I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice.
It's a Global cutting knife made in Japan.
Second of all, it's really beautifully balanced: it holds well, it feels well.
And third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts.
It's a delight to use.
And so it's got everything, right?
It's beautiful and it's functional.
And I can tell you stories about it, which makes it reflective, and so you'll see I have a theory of emotion.
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out.
It was third.
And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it, this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.
It's round, it's neat.
It actually affects the way the brain works.
That's what fear and anxiety does; it causes you to be -- what's called depth-first processing -- to focus, not be distracted.
So they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here and they couldn't reach the other string.
Still can't reach it.
They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water.
They keep it for -- you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water.
Behavioral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
I'm doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious; it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot.
That's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back, and you put tea in, and then you fill it with water.
And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing.
And when it's finished, you put it vertically, and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line and the water only comes to here -- and so it keeps the tea out.
Cognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it -- saying good, bad, safe, dangerous, and getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax.
And the third level is reflective, which is, if you like the superego, it's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do, no control over the -- doesn't see the senses, doesn't control the muscles.
I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time.
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in "Minority Report," the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you.
If he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating -- it gets projected right on the cover of the book.
It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look, and look a little longer, and maybe even understand.
It can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space.
It is our humanity, and all the potential within it, that makes us beautiful.
This is in nature: it overrides a carnivorous nature and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death.
I love this picture because my daughter, who's now almost 40, is in this picture, but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination, her ability to spin yarns at this age -- preschool.
And I love this one, because it's also what we're about.
We don't know a whole lot about what it does for the human brain, because funding has not been exactly heavy for research on play.
I'm sorry I don't have a playful-looking subject, but it allows mobility, which has limited the actual study of play.
The animal world has objectified it.
If you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with, and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with, and then you present those rats with a cat odor-saturated collar, they're hardwired to flee and hide.
You may not know this word, but it should be your biological first name and last name.
Or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it and paying attention to it.
Because when you put it on, you immediately get everything you need to have a fun and productive and useful meeting.
But when you take it off -- that's when the real action happens.
So it's not just something you do in your spare time.
Nobody really did anything with it, pretty much.
And so he gave me the time to code it up.
I wrote the code and put it out there.
Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people don't read your memo -- actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy.
One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it -- one of the great TED Talks.
The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple.
You hug your database, you don't want to let it go until you've made a beautiful website for it.
Here we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now -- curing cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's, understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable, understanding how the world works.
Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google.
Scientists are totally stymied at the moment -- the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.
Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now -- The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.
Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now -- The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.
"In the theory with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance is the artificer; so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system, that, in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine, it is not requisite to know how to make it.
It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet.
Honey is sweet because we like it, not "we like it because honey is sweet."
So if you think first there was sweetness, and then we evolved to like sweetness, you’ve got it backwards; that’s just wrong. It’s the other way round.
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity -- or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly -- you take a long time, but each second is not as painful -- which one of those is the right approach?
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it, and I would crunch it a little bit.
And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting, but also it tells us something, I think, about the stock market situation we're in.
And I came back to measure what we technically call the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators?
The fact is, is that the British Museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the 18th century -- it was actually mummified, skin and all -- but in a fit of space-saving zeal, they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire.
I wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton; I just noticed that as I finished this skull, the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be.
Built out of words, it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie, in which another object is created: a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words, inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.
I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.
It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made.
It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it, because I can see it compared to this thing, and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing, it's made from the exact same mold that this one is.
There you can see, it's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds.
And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one, it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch.
One, I can fire a freaking laser at it, which I have already done, to do a 3D scan -- there's a 3D scan of this Falcon.
The auto-gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter, but it should have -- it wasn't a big success.
It's the only Spanish innovation, technologically, of the 20th century, by the way.
The copy, which you can't see because it goes on and on for several pages, says that steerage passengers can't get their to bunks before the voyage is over, and it's so safe it carries no insurance.
I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers.
Because really, it's a condition about choice, and the lack of freedom.
Basically you take an ordinary telephone, you plug it into this little box that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem.
Now, it works just like a regular phone.
Basically, the reason you haven't heard about this program is because it was introduced last year on June 29.
What I didn't anticipate was that Steve Jobs went around and said, "Tell you what -- I'll give you a five-year exclusive if you'll let me design this phone in peace -- and you won't even see it till it's done."
It's got bad things and good things. Lets all acknowledge that right now.
But it did change a few things. The first thing it changed was that all those carriers saw that they sold 10 million of these things in a year.
Touch it and it dials a number at random."
A song is running through your head -- you sing it into the thing: do do do do do, da da da da da da, da dum ...
OK, you tap, "Done" and it will find out the song and play it for you.
It has a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down.
If you like it, it tries another song on you from a different band, with the same instrumentation, vocals, theme and tempo.
Concerns -- I have a few. It's got some flaws; we may just face it.
OK now, more importantly, had we been there in the '40s and '50s, '60s, had we seen this disease, had we understood exactly what was going on with it, how might that have changed and completely transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved?
I like to call our laboratory the coldest place in Central Africa -- it might be.
It's called "Gas."
smiles back, and leans into the open window, which wouldn't even be open if it were winter -- if it were winter someone would have closed it  -- leans into the window, farther, still smiling, farther and farther, though it takes less time than this, really an instant, and lets herself fall.
And the girl remembers, in this infinite instant already now so many times divided, the sadness she felt once, hardly knowing she felt it, to merely inhabit herself.
Some people say it should be free; it should be tabloid, or even smaller: A4; it should be local, run by communities, or niche, for some smaller groups like business -- but then it's not free; it's very expensive.
I took an architectural rule about function and form and translated it into newspaper content and design.
If I put some tension on my body, tension on my suit, I can make it fly. And as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface.
So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design, interiors and furniture, we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it, and trying to portray laminate, and a trailer, in kind of a fresh, new contemporary look.
By the time the soldier advanced close enough to see the telltale wires of the bomb, it exploded in a wave of flame.
Now, depending how close you are and how much explosive has been packed into that bomb, it can cause death or injury. You have to be as far as 50 yards away to escape that.
The Germans figured out how to use it right, and so what we have to think about for the U.S. is that we are ahead right now, but you have 43 other countries out there working on military robotics, and they include all the interesting countries like Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran.
It was set to music.
It was set to the pop song "I Just Want To Fly" by Sugar Ray.
So instead of doing the talking head thing, instead it's composed of scenes, and we meet people along the way.
They don't come back several times, so it really chronicles a journey.
It's something like life, that once you get in it you can't get out.
And I think you'll enjoy this building, it's never been seen -- it's been still photographed, but never photographed by a film crew.
A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it, it was built entirely by hand, I think they got a crane the last year.
It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding, people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads, dumping them in the forms.
So it continued on for many years after he died.
I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station, it was so consistent with his life, you know?
It assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them.
That is, how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up, and attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate -- how big a deal is it to them?
Different people trade off between standing by their outcome, faithfully holding to it, going down in a blaze of glory, or giving it up, putting their finger in the wind, and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position.
This bacterium has the special property that it makes light, so it makes bioluminescence, like fireflies make light.
What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid, and it's been turned on its back, and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells, they live in there, at high cell number that molecule is there, and they're making light.
The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light.
The squid is nocturnal, so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps, but then at night it has to come out to hunt.
On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in, since it's just in those couple feet of water.
Then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back.
And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom -- which is made by the bacterium -- exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back, so the squid doesn't make a shadow.
It actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter-illuminate itself in an anti-predation device so predators can't see its shadow, calculate its trajectory, and eat it.
But then if you think about it, the squid has this terrible problem because it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria and it can't sustain that.
Now the bacteria are dilute, that little hormone molecule is gone, so they're not making light -- but of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand.
And as the day goes by the bacteria double, they release the molecule, and then light comes on at night, exactly when the squid wants it.
It's used by all different bacteria and it's the language of interspecies communication.
Then again we turn to chemistry, and we figured out what this generic molecule is -- that was the pink ovals on my last slide, this is it.
It's a very small, five-carbon molecule.
We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we've made antagonists of the interspecies communication system.
What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal, in this case, a mouse, it doesn't initiate virulence right away.
It gets in, it starts growing, it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules.
Buying it from us screams good taste."
I'm not sure what it's called.
It literally -- when people say about the shock of recognition, it's literally re-cognition, rewiring how you think -- I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it.
People aren't simply projecting identity, they're creating it.
It's called the trillion-dollar stimulus package.
We have to make it immediately.
What's happening is we're taking this technology -- it's becoming more precise, more potent -- and we're turning it back upon ourselves.
What's happening is we're taking this technology -- it's becoming more precise, more potent -- and we're turning it back upon ourselves.
It's too slow.
It's too risk-averse.
And it is really not suited for the future that we're moving into.
It's a total media circus.
It will happen in five to 10 years.
And when it does it's not going to be that big a deal.
And it's going to do so for two reasons.
Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain, as though it was a world, and see tissues as landscapes, and hear blood density levels as music.
And it's our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful.
If I have an art, it's deconstructing things that really scare the living hell out of me.
So here are the new rules of swimming, if any of you are afraid of swimming, or not good at it.
In freestyle, easiest way to remedy this is to turn with body roll, and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water.
Now what I like about this video is it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together because of his lead. He had a strong lead.
I've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct the American public school system, to either fix it or replace it.
The interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard.
It's a project that now reaches across three continents, and its roots go into the fields of mathematics, marine biology, feminine handicraft and environmental activism.
It's also a project that in a very beautiful way, the development of this has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth, which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying right here in February 2009 -- which, as one of our previous speakers told us, is the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin.
Cast it in bronze."
But it turns out there is a very good reason why we are crocheting it because many organisms in coral reefs have a very particular kind of structure.
This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the 19th century.
But not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it.
They've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness, it's called a geodesic.
This is what it looks like.
Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate -- didn't know it was impossible to violate, and they're simply getting on with it.
I once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age.
It also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was, what they thought it could and couldn't do, what they thought it could and couldn't represent.
But it built a romance.
If you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying.
Design nowadays, if you mean it, you don't start with styling sketches.
So I took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they didn't have to fuss with it.
So my idea was that, instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls, that you would sit on the chair, and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline.
So that if you sit down on my chair, whether you're five feet tall or six foot six, it always deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don't have to look for something to adjust.
Now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it'll fit, you know, a tall guy and a short girl.
But then I knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with headrests that nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position.
And you need it in a different position when you're upright, then when you're reclined.
While you're sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five-footer, or you can adjust it for the six-foot-six guy -- all within the scope of a few simple adjustments.
Now if you look at '96, Bill Clinton -- the last Democrat to actually win -- how he did in '96, you see real big differences in this part of the country right here, the kind of Appalachians, Ozarks, highlands region, as I call it: 20 or 30 point swings from how Bill Clinton did in '96 to how Obama did in 2008.
These things, among maybe other variables, but these things seem to predict it.
Racism is predictable. And it's predicted by interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you, people of other races.
If we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't, we can start to design solutions to it.
And our system was rudimentary. It was very basic.
It was a mash-up that used data that we collected from people, and we put it on our map.
It has a deep melancholy ring.
It's why they leave lights on around the house.  Adults find it comforting.
But wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship?
Today a container ship can carry 150,000 tons; it can be manned with a smaller crew; and unloaded faster than ever before.
It has stored, recorded, can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands, tens of thousands of objects, actions, and their relationships in the world.
And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills.
And in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self-development.
And the brain actually is at the mercy of the sound environment in which it is reared.
And what I see is that the animal's brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form that's idealized, within the limits of its processing achievements to represent it in an organized and orderly way.
In the next great epoch of life, which applies for most of life, the brain is actually refining its machinery as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities.
And in this epoch, which extends from late in the first year of life to death; it's actually doing this under behavioral control.
It was actually conducted about five years ago in collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence in Marseilles.
It had a success rate of about one in eight tries.
And 700 or so tries later the monkey is performing it flawlessly -- never fails.
It's constructed. It's created in your brain.
And it's created in the brain via physical change.
It's not Japanese.
It creates a representation of language crap.
It can also happen in the brain.
The brain itself can be noisy. It's commonly noisy.
Of course they will. Because as a receiver of language, they are receiving it and representing it, and in information it's representing crap.
Of course they will. Because as a receiver of language, they are receiving it and representing it, and in information it's representing crap.
A way to think about this is you can actually re-refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it.
Just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning, it's going back into chaos in the end.
Get ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future, just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period.
But she told me, "Mom, it's not American."
It's one of the most lethal things we've seen in circulation in the world in any recent centuries.
It's also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds.
In experimental feeding in monkeys you can see that it actually downregulates a specific immune system modulator.
We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus.
A public health survey analyzed the effect that large-scale Tamiflu use would have, actually shows it counteractive to public health measures, making matters worse.
But the virus clearly went through one round around the world in a mild enough form that the British army in World War I actually certified that it was not a threat and would not affect the outcome of the war.
And the system gets perturbed. It moves upwards to a fragmented state.
And depending on who you ask, the surge was supposed to push it up even further.
And so I'm thinking, right, great, it's going to keep going down.
It's moved up again. The groups are more fragmented.
So it allows it to roll.
And the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction.
And then there was a second level to this object, which is that it -- I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in, which is the diameter of the Moon and the diameter of the Earth in proportion to each other.
And then there was a second level to this object, which is that it -- I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in, which is the diameter of the Moon and the diameter of the Earth in proportion to each other.
The thing is, is that it's slightly dangerous.
It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave.
And that's what supports the object and keeps it stable.
So you can see it rotating here.
It weighs about a ton or over a ton.
It's made of stainless steel, quite thick.
But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium.
It's susceptible to motion by the air currents.
The idea of this air genie is, it's something that can just transform and become anything.
It has speakers on it. And it has cameras over the surface of it.
So it can see its environment, and then it can mimic its environment and disappear.
It weighs about 20 tons.
And then at night the idea is that it would be used as kind of a rave situation, where the people could cut loose, and the music and the lights, and everything.
So it could land in a park, for example.
It would also be able to be an open code, so people could interact with it.
It would also be able to be an open code, so people could interact with it.
As I will show to you, it is actually the mainstay of modern life.
It brought us power. It brought us mechanization, fertilizers.
And it actually drove up our yields.
And don't despise the white bread because it really, I think, symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all.
And as it became cheaper, bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things.
It is the basic, most fundamental food that we've had in the last ten thousand years.
And the whiter the bread, in many countries, the better it is.
It was invented by farmers in Iraq and Syria in particular.
It's a luxury solution for us who can afford it, if you want to afford it.
It has different functions.
There are different ways in which we must use it -- for residential, for nature, for agriculture purposes.
And never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap.
And never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap.
And so as I'm finishing my bread here -- and I've been baking it, and I'll try not to burn my hands.
Eat it, and feel privileged.
And I've been studying it for a couple years.
I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding, but what they do is, they take a light bulb and they smash it.
It enables him to hire men who used to get paid 50 cents a day and pay them five dollars a day.
Take a good idea and push it on the world.
Instead what it's allowed is silos of interest.
She does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it.
They need the leadership. It makes a difference.
These Gapminder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world, or how we estimate that it was.

These ideas have brought together something which has made India happen the way it is today.
Therefore India is at a critical point where either it can leverage its demographic dividend or it can lead to a demographic disaster.
Again, after having lived for more than 200 years under the East India Company and under imperial rule, Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism.
For some reason, whatever reason -- lack of money, lack of priorities, because of religion having an older culture -- primary education was never given the focus it required.
But now I believe it's reached a point where it has become very important.
But I realized, for that to be true -- for theft of our children's future to be a crime -- there must be a clear, demonstrable alternative to the take-make-waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization, and is the major culprit, stealing our children's future, by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator --
in short, digging up the earth and converting it to pollution.
Still it works to help us understand the problem.
So we set out at Interface, in 1994, to create an example: to transform the way we made carpet, a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy, and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact, rather than multiplied it.
We call it Cool Carpet.
And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator, increasing sales and profits.
It is practical, and pretty too.
You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together.
And we have a choice to make during our brief, brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet: to hurt it or to help it.
And it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen.
And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways.
You can't look at this and say, "Now I see reality as it is."
It says, "Check the box below if you don't want to participate ..."
But it wasn't useless in the sense that it helped people figure out what they wanted.
I have to read you what she said, because I love it.
This just kills me, not because I wanted to use it -- I wanted to see it.
It wasn't spurted or thrown or ejected under great force.
It goes 150 miles an hour.
It's got an amazing user experience.
And it was found close to here, Stanford.
And it was very funny. I used four, five and six years old kids.
They taught me about what a strong marriage feels like: that it's built on faith and commitment and an admiration for each other's unique gifts.
And he urged the people in that meeting, in that community, to devote themselves to closing the gap between those two ideas, to work together to try to make the world as it is and the world as it should be, one and the same.
You are the women who will build the world as it should be.
They call it the Oval Office.
And I hope in pursuing your dreams, you all remain resolute, that you go forward without limits, and that you use your talents -- because there are many; we've seen them; it's there -- that you use them to create the world as it should be.
And it's full of challenges.
All the genetic information for future generations of plants So here is the building; it looks rather unassuming, really.
But it goes down below ground many stories.
And it's the largest seed bank in the world.
How much does it cost?
And don't press your luck about how much those who do believe in it actually understand it.
You can be sure Jefferson knew what he was talking about when he said, "If a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization, it expects what never was, and never will be."
When the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.
It undercuts self-righteousness, radically alters the tone and character of controversy, and enriches dramatically the possibilities for finding common ground.
Think of it as a kind of secular church.
It's not linear. And our intuition is linear.
Woman: Love? Love is nice if you can have it.
Ninth Man: You see, family is ... it's awful.
It is about the state of the planet.
The film is given for free to the distributor for TV and theater to show it the fifth of June.
It is also available for school, cities, NGOs and you.
And after that, most likely it's going to begin to decline.
It is unbelievably bad.
Cortisol floods the brain; it destroys hippocampal cells and memory, and can lead to all kinds of health problems.
And it's been missing. It's been missing from psychotherapy.
We use this word "happy," and it's this very large umbrella of a term.
It wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex.
It wouldn't do anything but press this bar.
It's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye, the orbicularis oculi.
Extroverts use it more than introverts.
People who are relieved of depression show it more after than before.
We are very acutely aware of our social status and always seek to further and increase it.
I seize command by physical prowess, and I keep it by beating my chest, and you make submissive gestures.
And here is what it does.
And if you look, you can see that it uses the toe peeling, just like the gecko does.
If we can show some of the video, you can see it climbing up the wall.
There it is.
And now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive that the Stanford group was able to do in designing this incredible robot.
You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko.
It has a tail. And just when you think you've figured out nature, this kind of thing happens.
It can also be used in defense.
And we ran it up a surface.
And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail when it slips. This is slowed down 10 times.
And watch it now slip, and see what it does with its tail.
It has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg, and it contributes to stability.
If we could have the lights on it.
Now, of course, we were normally frightened because the animal has no gliding adaptations, so we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.
We'll blow the air up, we'll give it a landing target, a tree trunk, just outside the plexi-glass enclosure, and see what it does.
We'll blow the air up, we'll give it a landing target, a tree trunk, just outside the plexi-glass enclosure, and see what it does.
And the way it does it, is it takes its tail and it swings it one way to yaw left, and it swings its other way to yaw right.
Maybe it's evolved from coming down from trees, and trying to control a glide.
And it certainly looks like it.
You can see it even better from down on top.
Watch the whip of its tail as it does it. Look at that.
But then as it gets closer to the tree, look at the close-up. And see if you can see it land.
So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.
You see it there? There? Watch it come down.
You see it there? There? Watch it come down.
Now watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit?
But then I got into stuff that I didn't love, like management. I am the world's worst manager, but I figured I should be doing it, because I was, after all, the president of the company.
It didn't help.
It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.
It's a continuous journey.
And if we want to avoid "success-to-failure-syndrome," we just keep following these eight principles, because that is not only how we achieve success, it's how we sustain it.
And so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materially closed -- that is, nothing goes in or out at all, no material -- and energetically open, which is essentially what planet Earth is.
Let's take it on a maiden voyage.
Will it work? Or will something happen that we can't understand and we can't fix, thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres?
I had no idea what was in my food, where it came from.
You probably read something about it in the papers.
If you want to have a conversation in this world, you have it with one other person.
If you want to address a group, you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group, whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press.
We've had the Internet in its public form for almost 20 years now, and it's still changing as the media becomes more social.
And the earthquake was reported as it was happening.
The last time China had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened.
The really crazy change is here: it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other, the fact that former consumers are now producers, the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another; because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals, and because the size of the network, the complexity of the network is actually the square of the number of participants, meaning that the network, when it grows large,
Within days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on myBO.com; within weeks of its being created it was the largest group.
Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join, to deny its existence, to delete it, to take to off the site.
And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this, and compared it to anyone in this room, or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis, I am convinced it would look very, very different.
And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with a viral memetic infection like this, and compared it to anyone in this room, or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis, I am convinced it would look very, very different.
But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem, if you will.
It happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us.
Surgery didn't hurt anymore, but it killed you pretty quickly.
Some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years, but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique until the 1980s, when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that, that allowed this to be done for real operations.
So what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand, and put it on the other side of that small incision, is you need to put a wrist on that instrument.
And now, in contrast to the laparoscopy, you can precisely place the needle in your instruments, and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory.
And now, in contrast to the laparoscopy, you can precisely place the needle in your instruments, and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a trajectory.
So something like a prostatectomy -- the prostate is small, and it's in one spot, and you can set your robot up very precisely to work in that one spot.
One of the problems with this, even for surgeons who've been looking at this a lot, is you can't see the cancer, especially when it's hidden below the surface.
Life is temptation. It's all about yielding, resisting, yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective, present focus and future focus.
And because the government would be funding it, it would be co-branding these services.
And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders, like many of the people here, by new tools, like the ones we've seen here, and by new pressures.
What it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago.
And when it comes out, a series of wiki sites under the label WISER, are going to launch at the same time.
It began a little less than two years ago.
It's one of the great products of the human mind.
You see how resistant it is to those very ideas.
It's been missing in much of the architecture, because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered, the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion, that has no value.
It's like the old Las Vegas used to be.
It's not only the giving of answers.
So architecture maybe is not so big, like science, but through its focal point it can leverage in an Archimedian way what we think the world is really about.
It's an art of communication.
It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires.
It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available.
You know it costs a lot of money and so on, but yes, it should not play it safe.
It should not play it safe, because if it plays it safe it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be.
So democracy, as difficult as it is, I believe in it.
So democracy, as difficult as it is, I believe in it.
Compromise, if it's artistic, if it is able to cope with its strategies -- and there is my first sketch and the last rendering -- it's not that far away.
It's a pivot between a process and a system.
It was part of the business of life in general.
It was part of the quality of life.
And the town has really embraced it.
Design is not just for designers anymore. It's a process. It's not style.
Cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain doesn't actually see the world as it is, but instead, creates a series of mental models through a collection of "Ah-ha moments," or moments of discovery, through various processes.
And what it does is locates the object in physical body space.
And this is deep inside of the brain. It's very old, evolutionarily.
And it's the part that feels.
It's the kind of gut center, where you see an image and you go, "Oh! I have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever I'm seeing."
And we know money is the root of all evil, but it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia, in fact.
And I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well, but your body knows it extremely well.
And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them.
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like, like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular, because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.
It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it.
That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body, and will alert your immune system to go after it.
In other words, the rise of the West, dramatic as it was, is over.
The informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics: it's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.
We don't understand how it works yet, but we have to.
It brings carrying capacity down, and there's not enough carrying capacity to support the people. And then you're in trouble.
And everyone will keep burning it because it's so cheap, until governments make it expensive.
And everyone will keep burning it because it's so cheap, until governments make it expensive.
And if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization.
How do we reconfigure it?
I would say yes. It is obviously about not just about decorating the world, and making it look even better, or even worse, if you ask me.
It's made out of ice.
If you stand still, the landscape doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is.
It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at.
Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around.
So this is how it's passed from mother to son.
But if you have this gene, in utero your brain is bathed in this, so your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin, so it doesn't work later on in life.
And here is this "Killed Strangely," and it's this historical book.
And that book is very interesting. Because it's about witch trials, and how people thought back then.
And we don't know where it's going to pop up.
This polymer is amazing because it's present in so many different organisms.
Where it protected the body against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation, the destruction, or damage to DNA, and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate, which helps to fuel cell production, and reproduction in the body.
Because the problem there is just as severe, but it is more sinister, because vitamin D deficiency, from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation, is a major problem.
Take your skin color, and celebrate it.
Foreign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites; it’s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging, who are communicating with each other around the world.
A financial crisis, just as we have seen, could not be solved by America alone or Europe alone; it needed the world to work together.
If people can find that that sub-prime product has been transferred across nations many, many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland or the rest in Britain, and people's ordinary savings are affected by it, then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision.
You encounter it within minutes at a party, when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early 21st century, "What do you do?"
If you open the newspaper any day of the week, it's full of people who've messed up their lives.
Tragic art, as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece, in the fifth century B.C., was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail, and also according them a level of sympathy, which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them.
And I think that is the message of tragedy to us, and why it's so very, very important, I think.
So any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on, where the element of loss is.
It's a letter from "Artforum" in 1967 saying "We can't imagine ever doing a special issue on electronics or computers in art." And they still haven't.
And if it isn't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically tightly coupled to the sounds you made.
How could it respond, in a way, to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we're looking at it?
And what could it do if it could look back at us?
And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else.
And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else.
And we got so overheated in the chase that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.
Nobody has questioned it.
And now it's whipped away from under you.
So they say, "Yes it's wrong, but supposing it was right ..."
And he called it hypothesis-free science.
And he despised it from the bottom of his heart.
Why should it be there?
I am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years, this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe, and it is not lunatic fringe.
Of course they don't believe it, but they like it."
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.
Income there stayed stagnant, as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.
In the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.
To make it work, we need good rules. We've already discussed that.
It's a rule for changing rules.
My work is -- it's a reflection of myself.
But I thought, perhaps the ant won't know, it'll probably move in.
It became part of me.
So, to cut a long story short, I went home, went underneath the microscope, and I crushed up a piece of glass, crushed it up.
And it went like this ...
What I did, I plucked the tag out and put it underneath the microscope.
WW: So what I did is the same process where I just kind of hold my breath and just work away very, very slowly, manipulating the plastic, cutting it, because it behaves different.
WW: So what I did is the same process where I just kind of hold my breath and just work away very, very slowly, manipulating the plastic, cutting it, because it behaves different.
And it starts to dry very quickly.
To get the symmetrical shape of the horse was very difficult, because I had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was in some kind of action.
And made a needle look like the Hulk's broken it.
And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider.
But I had to rig it with strands of glue.
It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape.
So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.
Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water, and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?
What's it taste of?
It'll last for 6,000 liters.
And when it's expired, using failsafe technology, the system will shut off, protecting the user.
She picks the water up from there, desalinates it, for free, transports it over there, and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.
All we've go to do is make it sterile. How do we do that?
They can get it from a source nearby.
It was called the bullet train because it was rounded in front, but every time it went into a tunnel it would build up a pressure wave, and then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited.
We take water and push it against a membrane.
And it finds many many ways to put many functions into it.
It's waterproof.
It's breathable. It creates color through structure.
It's called AskNature.org.
And also telling it like now.
And I said, "No stop until we get it."
You look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks.
But it can also have this other function, as a platform for the candle.
What's interesting about this experiment is that it's not an aberration.
So, for tasks like this, a narrow focus, where you just see the goal right there, zoom straight ahead to it, they work really well.
Management is not a tree, it's a television set.
Somebody invented it.
It doesn't mean it's going to work forever.
We'll never know if this stuff worked. Actually, I think the Federal Bureau of Investigation took it down for security purposes, sometime in the early 1900s.
And if you can cause that coil to resonate, what will happen is it will pulse at alternating current frequencies -- at a fairly high frequency, by the way.
And then what you do is, you start out with electricity, turn it into magnetic field, take that magnetic field, turn it back into electricity, and then you can use it.
And then what you do is, you start out with electricity, turn it into magnetic field, take that magnetic field, turn it back into electricity, and then you can use it.
And the other thing that's pretty cool about the technology is that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency.
You'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back, to do that, and it probably beeps, actually, as it goes on as well.
You'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back, to do that, and it probably beeps, actually, as it goes on as well.
It's not really, really flat.
Can you see how it's growing? And how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia?
and then it will continue forward like this.
But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it, because it's the only child mortality that we can measure.
But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it, because it's the only child mortality that we can measure.
But now it's not falling, because there, with help from PEPFAR, it's working with treatment. And people are not dying.
Make it a local issue. And do prevention at each place, in the way it can be done there.
The idea is simple, basic. It's not original, but it's important, and it's important to participate.
It's motion and emotion.
It's information.
It's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial.
It's conceptual. It's universal. It's beyond words and numbers.
It's happening.
I wouldn't tell them what it was, but it was in alphabetical order, and I would tell them to look for their names, their family names, their mother's maiden name.
It's called "The Apples of New York" and this is the second volume.
but, to be honest, the description goes on and it says that it "doesn't rank high in quality, however."
It's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good, unique trait.
And for that reason, we ought to be saving it.
If agriculture hasn't experienced that, how could it be adapted?
So we needed a really safe place, and we went quite far north to find it.
And if anything happens, then they can come back and get it.
And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem, and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.
And ever since then, I've wondered why it is that capitalism is so amazingly efficient at some things, but so inefficient at others, why it's so innovative in some ways and so un-innovative in others.
It's already immersed in social networks.
It will become more involved in social investment, and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others, not just from what you sell to them, and from relationships as well as from consumption.
Then, people said monarchy dominated everywhere because it was rooted in human nature.
Just as today, the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism say it's rooted in human nature, only now it's individualism, inquisitiveness, and so on.
And as that happens, we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism, which is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks, it's not a self-sufficient system.
It depends on other systems, on ecology, on family, on community, and if these aren't replenished, capitalism suffers too.
It's not just competitive, it's also caring.
It will be worse at the end of this year, quite possibly worse in a year's time than it is today.
We've seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter.
And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air, and hopefully you make it look good.
It's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer, because it will break your legs very, very quickly if you land on it wrong.
"Well, we can flip the bus over, we can have it burst into flames, and how about someone, you know, big explosion."
My balloon will expand to 500 times and look like a big pumpkin when it's at the top.
It's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous.
And they've made a dummy of him. That's exactly what it looked like.
And it weighs 300 pounds and you can't skydive in it.
Science tends to look at the world through the rational, the quantitative -- things that can be measured and described -- but it gives art a terrific context of understanding.
I'm fascinated by the beauty of it, the mutability of it, the malleability of it, and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself.
If everybody in the developed world understood this graph, and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads, there would be no further societal argument about climate change because this is the story that counts.
In the past hundred years, the temperature of the Earth has gone up 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit, .75 degrees Celsius, and it's going to keep going up because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere.
That means that glacier's floating and it's unstable, and you're about to see the consequences of that floating.
The calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off, but in fact, it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet.
The smaller the ice mass, the faster it responds to climate.
It's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left.
It now goes at 125 feet a day, dumping all this ice into the ocean.
But what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet.
Fortunately, a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now.
It's fucking freezing.
I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end.
And for a swimmer, you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you.
And it is 4,200 meters deep.
And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his, where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his, the three-year-old comes up with another explanation: He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it, because now it's dirty, on the ground.
So whereas in the adults, as I told you, this brain region is almost completely specialized -- it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts -- in children it's much less so, when they are age five to eight, the age range of the children I just showed you.
And perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar and puts it in her friend's coffee, people say she deserves no blame at all.
Where Grace thought the powder was sugar, because it was labeled "sugar" and by the coffee machine, but actually the powder was poison.
It's called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation, or TMS.
Until recently, what we knew about the brain were the things that any other animal's brain could do too, so we could study it in animal models.
But in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world's GDP.
I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy, or McMafia, for short.
It has zones of production, like Afghanistan and Columbia.
It has zones of distribution, like Mexico and the Balkans.
The Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons, and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets.
And it's the fastest thing on European waters.
I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out, because the first person I received it from was an ex-girlfriend of mine.
But for another client in another culture, it could really be the right answer to a different question.
You never know when you might need it.
So the People's Building, as we called it.
Like with the water, instead of talking about it, we're going to sail a million liters of harbor water from Copenhagen to Shanghai, so the Chinese who have the courage can actually dive in and feel how clean it is.
And I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds.
After it had been sent off, his secretary said to him, "Did you get that letter from the woman at the fete?
It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest.
And nobody really knows what it is or why it's there.
But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.
So that's why we don't think it exists, the Sufi masters working on us.
And this is increasingly peculiar, because about 20 years ago, when they started delving into the genome, they thought it would probably contain around 100,000 genes.
I don't know if you know this. Modern physics, there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient for the figures.
It's much easier if it's not really there.
It's said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual.
But it's odd that you can't see the beam of light, you can only see what it hits.
You can't see a point. It's by definition dimensionless, like an electron, oddly enough.
On one occasion, he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe, and realized it was himself.
It's activated when one recognizes cartoons, when one draws cartoons, and when one hallucinates them.
But I want to give you three examples to try to say that the trend line is in fact in the other direction, and it's the Internet helping it along.
No CEO, no firm responsible, singly, for building it.
Imagine, you being part of a network where, you're maybe at a sporting event, and you're sitting in rows like this, and somebody asks for a beer, and it gets handed at the aisle.
And your neighborly duty is to pass the beer along, at risk to your own trousers, to get it to the destination.
This is a system that relies on kindness and trust, which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable.
And they came together to help find the problem and fix it.
And it turns out this model is everywhere, once you start looking for it.
How does it really work? It turns out there is a back room that is kind of windowless, metaphorically speaking.
Some of you may remember Star Wars Kid, the poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever, acting as if it were a light saber.
If you do, it will be removed immediately, removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision, but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion.
You send in a picture of your cat if it looks like Hitler.
And we now have means that we can build, like this system, so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it.
It's not a noun. It's a verb.
So, the bigger problem with this logic is that it confuses the intended versus the actual uses of technology.
So the only way to control this message is actually to try to spin it and accuse anyone who has written something critical of being, for example, a CIA agent.
Why? Because they somehow assume that the Internet is going to be the catalyst of change that will push young people into the streets, while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography.
And this is realistic. And there is nothing wrong about it because the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people and it plays a completely different social role for them.
So it does play a social role, however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement.
It involves a campaign of letter writing, research and phone calls to access my subjects, which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in West Virginia.
They didn't want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs, and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth.
But there are multiple truths attached to every image, depending on the creator's intention, the viewer and the context in which it is presented.
And it's just another place from which to observe, and the understanding that there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.
It's titled, "An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar," and it's comprised of nearly 70 images.
It's titled "The Innocents."
Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth, in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.
And it reiterates that distortion is a constant, and our eyes are easily deceived.
On the one hand, we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy, thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity, but as individual customers, consumers, clients, people who want to make decisions in their own lives.
It recognizes that the market has its limitation, and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people.
The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
Second, it had to be extremely affordable.
And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable.
So history doesn't necessarily repeat itself, but it does rhyme.
Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together; now it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration.
The Kurds for 3,000 years have been waging a struggle for independence, and now is their chance to finally have it.
In order to profit from its oil it has to export it through Turkey or Syria, and other countries, and Iraq itself.
Well, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil and the way we're talking about it now.
Now it's their oil for their own purposes.
And I assure you it's every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.
It's constantly morphing and changing the world, like climate change.
As our industrial society matured, so design became a profession and it focused on an ever smaller canvas until it came to stand for aesthetics, image and fashion.
It may integrate technology and economics, but it starts with what humans need, or might need.
We can take this idea of participation perhaps to its logical conclusion and say that design may have its greatest impact when it's taken out of the hands of designers and put into the hands of everyone.
And people have emphasized the importance of compassion, not just because it sounds good, but because it works.
People often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody.
You also have to do it.
But you have it in planets and asteroids.
It's cool for me.
Every seven years, I close it for one year to pursue some little experiments, things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year.
It's called Be Here Now.
In the beginning, on the first sabbatical, it was rather disastrous.
We put a mask on it, looked at it deep down in the ground, checked it out from all sides, west, north, south, east, top and bottom.
Some of you might have seen it.
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?"
While we built all this up during that week, with the 100 volunteers, a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it.
While we built all this up during that week, with the 100 volunteers, a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it.
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.
So instead of trusting it, we fear it.
And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.
Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.
It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."
It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.
I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were, then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.
The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of a place called the Gallup Organization.
Now, I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel, that it had failed in a number of places, but I had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called African authenticity.
There is a word, an Igbo word, that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world, and it is "nkali."
It's a noun that loosely translates to "to be greater than another."
Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person, but to make it the definitive story of that person.
It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult.
It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar.
She had not only read the book, but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel.
Every time I am home I am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians: our failed infrastructure, our failed government, but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government, rather than because of it.
Your brain is learning, and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination; the left side of its visual field is under green illumination.
That's what it's learning. Okay?
Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow, and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow, it would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics.
And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to hold it here, and I'm going to spin it.
And for all of you, you'll see it probably spinning this direction.
And suddenly it will flip, and start spinning the opposite direction.
Keep blinking. Every time you blink, it will switch.
So I can ask you, which direction is it rotating?
Instead, color tells us something completely different, that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is.
We can't. Instead, the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past.
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.
On the inside it's a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house.
The man imported all the materials from Japan, and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style.
It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.
How does it work to make habitat for animals like me?"
And so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill, and I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that palm tree.
It's held in a geographic information system which allows me to zoom in.
And it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew.
And it's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide.
So, after some work we were able to georeference it, which allows us to put the modern streets on the city, and the buildings, and the open spaces, so that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is.
The place that you see here on the left side was interconnected. It was based on this diversity.
It had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world.
You start to believe that it's alive and aware.
We specked it out to actually be doable with a very, very low-cost bill of materials, so that it can become a childhood companion for kids.
Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years.
But, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business, that what we create in advertising, which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value, you might call it badge value, subjective value, intangible value of some kind -- gets rather a bad rap.
... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter.
He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.
We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food, but it's not very portable, generally.
Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod.
It tastes great within the borders of that country, but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else.
It tastes great within the borders of that country, but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else.
It's like a Noah's Ark. It's like an archive.
It runs out of space.
And what that illustrates is that decisions are the key things that support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive.
So, when you walk up to a door and you open it, what you compulsively have to do to perceive is to make decisions, thousands of decisions about the size of the room, the walls, the height, the objects in this room.
Is it capable of doing it?
Does it have the substance to do it?
It had to improve it a little bit.
It had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts, because they had to cope on land.
And when you think of the fabric of the brain, the structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet?
So, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do is you have to make this come alive.
We make it come alive with equations, a lot of mathematics.
We can ask, "Where is it inside, if we stimulate it with a picture?"
Where is it inside the neocortex?
Ultimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it.
Let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental, and much of it is unpleasant.  We stand on street corners, shouting over noise like this, and pretending that it doesn't exist.
It's powerful for two reasons. You recognize it fast, and you associate it very powerfully.
Then we also look at the idea of cow-pooling, which is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together to buy meat from organic farms that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled.
It's been tremendously powerful for consumers.
By the end of the talk, we're going to see it move.
If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily, you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions.
Then, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin, it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh.
And then speak a little bit about how it comes about.
It's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads.
How do we ensure that it creates a more inclusive technology, a technology which means that not only as we grow older, that we can also grow wiser, and that we're able to support the populations of the future?
Forget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going.
Because that event was the Scientific Revolution, ever since which our knowledge of the physical world, and of how to adapt it to our wishes, has been growing relentlessly.
It's always, as Karl Popper put it, theory-laden.
It's like all knowledge. It's conjectural, guesswork, tested by observation, not derived from it.
If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness, then it must happen everywhere on Earth simultaneously.
For instance, when Demeter is upset, she banishes heat from her vicinity, into the other hemisphere, where it makes summer.
And it's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it's testable.
I believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature, not insulating them from it.
It is able to move around its environment.
It can follow chemical gradients.
It can undergo complex reactions, some of which are happily architectural.
Here, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate.
It looks beautiful.
Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.
It might be able to self-repair, and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment.
This is our protocell technology, effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers, and depositing it in a very complex environment, against natural materials.
It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.
Also it will attract the local marine ecology, who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.
This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it, which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries.
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.
It helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world.
But on a larger scale of biology, actually symmetry is very important, because it actually communicates genetic information.
He wrote, "The universe cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written.
He has a character describing the snowflake, and he says he "shuddered at its perfect precision, found it deathly, the very marrow of death."
What can you do to a symmetrical object, move it in some way, so it looks the same as before you moved it?
What can you do to a symmetrical object, move it in some way, so it looks the same as before you moved it?
What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?
Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn, and still it looks like it did before I started.
Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn, and still it looks like it did before I started.
I could rotate it by a third of a turn, or a half a turn, or put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn.
And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn.
And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before I started.
Can anybody think what else I could do to this which would leave it like I did before I started?
I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I?
It's got no reflective symmetry.
But what I could do is just leave it where it is, pick it up, and put it down again.
But what I could do is just leave it where it is, pick it up, and put it down again.
I can reflect it in the line through X, or the line through Y, or the line through Z.
Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry where I just pick it up and leave it where it is.
Now, I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport, and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it.
It's as if it was reflected in the line through Y.
Take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn, then flip it. And then do it in the other order, and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction.
And they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one, it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17.
Well, unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board at the side here, great, excellent.
It will make you immortal.
If you put boiling water in, it will shatter.
It entails understanding the pain of the other.
But even more than that, it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation: understanding that one is part of that creation, that there is a unity that underlies all that we see, all that we hear, all that we feel.
What's matzah? What's unleavened bread? You don't get it.
He rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."
And he says, "God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread.
Take the bread. Take it home.
It is helpless.
It doesn't know how to survive, even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.
It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child.
As the child grows, it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust.
It doesn't know even the word "violation."
Therefore, it has to blame itself, a wordless blame, which is more difficult to really resolve -- the wordless self-blame.
As the child grows to become an adult: so far, it has been a consumer, but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute, to be a contributor.
That bigness should be centered on oneself, not in terms of money, not in terms of power you wield, not in terms of any status that you can command in the society, but it should be centered on oneself.
No culture, no nation and nationalism -- nothing can touch it because it is empathy.
No culture, no nation and nationalism -- nothing can touch it because it is empathy.
It transcends nation, the gender, the age.
Why? Because it is there in everybody.
It's experienced by people occasionally.
Then this occasional compassion, we are not talking about -- it will never remain occasional.
It has got to be you.
But if I say, in spite of my body being limited -- if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black: body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited.
You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.
You fake it and make it.
But growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated; it was a sensibility to how we are together.
I see -- always, it stirs my heart -- a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
That's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.
I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor, and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world.
One more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church: 9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall, a newspaperman and a television guy said, "That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church, we carried it on our station in this city.
How do you make it real?
My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal, and challenged me when I fell beneath it.
So, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion, and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history.
Compassion on earth is given, it is in us.
We know it all.
And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff, its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds.
And he again leaves, and this time: water dripping, making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream.
And he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic, and it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog.
And he took a shard of something, and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh, and he placed it on ground.
It's not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist, that's the logic.
That's good, but again we tend to deploy it selectively.
We blow it up and look at the pieces.
It's a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule.
Rather than using it for my computer, I actually opened it.
and this small system actually prints it out -- so it actually acts like a paper input-output system, just made out of paper.
If I put a boarding pass, it will show me where the flight gate is.
Yeah. Of course you can browse to any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it.
And so, when you study it, you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world.
To understand this difference in viewpoints, we have to understand the subjective truth of Alexander -- his myth, and the mythology that constructed it.
If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior, if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior, then it was bound to influence the business they were in.
So, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse, chaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable.
You can't measure it. You can't manage it.
And it has.
They try and build it. They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.
It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean.
Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection.
It's redolent of James Bond movies and Kipling ballads.
But sometimes it just sat there.
And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner that in a developing country communications are a luxury, not a right, that the government had no obligation to provide better service, and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone, could he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list for telephones in India.
And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure.
I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s, and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.
But people see a society for what it is, and that, it seems to me, is what ultimately will make a difference in today's information era, in today's TED age.
And it's the nationalism of an idea that essentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed, color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter, and still rally around a consensus.
The great success story of India, a country that so many learned scholars and journalists assumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s, is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.
He named it homunculus.
Basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain.
It's you. It's me.
It's our invisible reality.
So anyway, even if I do not understand science entirely, for my design I essentially refer to it.
It's a great tool for me to understand what could be our real needs.
It is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain.
So even if this object, even if this product includes some technology, it includes some speakers, it includes some microphones and some electronic devices, this object is not a very smart object.
I want, by this design feel, when you see it, you see, instinctively, this object seems to be very sensitive, very reactive.
And when the kids wake up, he can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth, and breathe the air it contains.
So when a passive object like this one seems to be alive, because it is -- woosh -- starting to move.
And it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died.
After, it goes back into the fish tank.
Or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set.
But, at the time, in the 13th century, it was the gadget of the day.
It was the world's first popular computer.
And it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky.
He would not only know what time it was, he would also know where the sun would rise, and how it would move across the sky.
He would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set.
In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying.
And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know?
And he said, "Doesn't matter if a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice."
Like all stories, it has a beginning.
Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot, where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words, this pot would just make as much food as you liked, without you having to do any work, provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge.
It's self-organizing. There is no great central organization that pushes this; people just pick up an idea and they run with it, and they implement it where they are.
You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.
You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.
But let us honor what it has bought us, and move forward from this point.
Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices, the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.
It seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people, and especially in Africa and China.
They had to move this village in 1987 as a huge dune threatened to swallow it.
It adds roughness to the dune's surface, to the texture of the dune's surface, binding the grains.
It provides a physical support structure for the trees, and it creates physical spaces, habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes.
So, in that sense, it's a very simple object.
But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe, and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe.
So why is it so important?
It's important because it tells us that any object can become a black hole.
And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.
It depends only on the mass of the object.
So, if I were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford, it would become a black hole.
So, if I were to take the sun and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford, it would become a black hole.
So, if a star starts its life off with much more mass than the mass of the Sun, it's going to end its life by exploding and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.
And if there is a supermassive black hole, what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.
This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly the diameter of a tennis court.
Atmosphere is great for us; it allows us to survive here on Earth.
And that's because it goes around in only 15 years.
And it's a very fragile entity.
It strips that gas cloud apart.
It pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart.
And the water will go where it should go.
And then it is 40 feet deep.
It can break sometimes.
And this is what they call Zero B type of water, because it comes from the clouds, pure distilled water.
Of course there are some areas where water is reaching, I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all.
But it is invisible.
Or, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms.
When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank, it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in English today "mass communication."
The reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up.
It was designed some 150 years ago.
But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009, there will be a TED green and blue session, so they painted it like this.
If it comes up, some of them will be submerged.
The question is, which letter is it if I unfold it?
It's made by the company Think Fun.
This was not a devastating stroke, but it did affect his speaking and so forth.
She said, "I keep this will by my bed, memento mori, and I change it all the time just because I want to."
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support, many people like this would probably never get services, and certainly not when they most need it.
And it's called "The 99."
And by this time next year, the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with "The 99" to beat injustice wherever they find it.
It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing.
This contingent seems to be quite lucky, and it has not sustained any casualties, even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia.
And when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with and they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them.
Hot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it.
It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India.
And, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world.
It lives throughout the tropics, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.
And it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it.
And it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it.
But it really hasn't been studied very much.
It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly.
It's sort of dull-colored. And it's fairly common.
Another important point of these sand banks is that when it rains, the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone.
So, it stays under the soil.
It's going towards India, not from India.
Now, what I said was, you get the southwest monsoon going one way, and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way.
And that front in the middle is not vertical, it's at an angle.
So, as it comes over towards Malé I'm standing in Malé underneath the front.
And it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa, where it's raining.
They'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time the seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here.
But before it was fossil poetry language was fossil metaphor.
So, I share it with all of you here today, though the idea itself is getting crystallized and I'm still writing up the business plan.
It can be worth up to one trillion dollars, being paid in bribes every year, or equal to India's GDP.
It never has been and it never will be.
As my close friend replied, when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project that it is an impossible task and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs, I quote: "Of course we cannot fail in this, at least in our own minds.
It's pretty hot.
You have to make it from something else.
Is it cost-competitive?
So, how would we make it?
When people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be, I say, "Yeah, but we've actually done it." Right?
It's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles.
It allowed to do all those things there.
And I think it's a nice metaphor also for the 21st century.
Just the fuselage here, it's so light.
It's not designed by an artist, but it could be.
You cannot imagine how it is for a team who has been working six years on it to show that it's not only a dream and a vision, it's a real airplane.
I don't think it will transport 200 people in the next years.
It's the greatest mystery confronting human beings: How does this all come about?
It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action.
Darwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years.
A human being, a child, can just watch its parent kill another polar bear, and skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body, and learn it in one step. What the polar bear took 100,000 years to learn, it can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes.
And I do really like this shot, because it shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers.
And should that pig have grown, unfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead after I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway.
And should that pig have grown, unfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead after I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway.
But once the bones had fused together it would have been healthy.
It weighs 1,250 kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it.
It makes it more organic, more natural.
But I just like it in bright orange.
The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize, but also it looks like it's a robot, and it comes from a sci-fi genus.
It's a surprise that it has humanity, but also man-made, future, alien associations.
Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.
It's so basic. It just grows wild.
That's what I really like about it, the fact that I haven't got to go and buy it, and it hasn't been genetically modified at all.
That's what I really like about it, the fact that I haven't got to go and buy it, and it hasn't been genetically modified at all.
The thicker the object, the more radiation it needs, and the more time it needs.
And with this image, I'm going to be displaying it in the Victoria and Albert Museum as a light box, which is actually attached to the car.
It reminds me of my college days.
Instead of serving family style, where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking, they serve at the counter, put the food away, and then bring it to the table.
And, roughly translated, it means "the reason for which you wake up in the morning."
And, of course, watch it fall from the sky and flow in our wonderful rivers, but for several other reasons as well.
It really changed my life totally.
It does have big teeth, however, and it's kind of hard to convince people if an animal has big teeth, that it's a harmless creature.
People scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it, something you wouldn't do in most north Indian rivers.
So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab, a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.
How? We designed a simple toolkit, converted it into eight languages, and reached 32,000 schools.
The first consideration, make it clear, simple and unambiguous.
So beautiful that I will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet, and the day Saturday, named after it, wonderfully.
And judging from this, it looks a little like a cheeseburger.
Bode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus.
And the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work.
Bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche, as she calls it, by exploding it into something spectacular.
But actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient, we actually exercise it.
We want to make sure that we condition this muscle, so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient.
We want to make sure that we condition this muscle, so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient.
We place it back into this oven-like device.
We take the scaffold, we seed it with cells, and you can now see here, the valve leaflets opening and closing.
Two weeks later, we basically can lift this organ up, it feels like a liver, we can hold it like a liver, it looks like a liver, but it has no cells.
A windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell.
We don't need to teach it to become another cell type.
Once you get the formula right you can replicate it.
It was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house.
But it also has the potential to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences.
In this case what we're doing is we're taking the orchestra floor, lifting it up, spinning it, changing the rake, taking it back to flat floor, changing the rake again. In essence, you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating, at will.
This building has the ability, in short order, to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out.
So, the theater company has the ability to do totally hermetic, light-controlled, sound-controlled, great acoustics, great intimacy Shakespeare, but can also do Beckett with the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it.
It's actually beautiful. There was a rock band.
And I want to call it the girl cell.
And it's in men as well as in women.
And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion, and it's empathy, and it's passion itself, and it's vulnerability, and it's openness, and it's intensity, and it's association, and it's relationship, and it is intuitive.
And then let's remember that we've been taught the exact opposite by the powers that be, that compassion clouds your thinking, that it gets in the way, that vulnerability is weakness, that emotions are not to be trusted, and you're not supposed to take things personally, which is one of my favorites.
And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women.
It's my baby and it's full of love."
And it was a house where girls could run away, they could save their clitoris, they wouldn't be cut, they could go to school.
And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here.
And I want to do it for Sunitha.
And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday, the girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else.
But I really want to do it for each and every person here, to value the girl in us, to value the part that cries, to value the part that's emotional, to value the part that's vulnerable, to understand that's where the future lies.
And you know what? Sometimes it should.
If it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally, resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes, to heart disease, to low I.Q.
So, you then place it into this little pocket back here, and it creates a warm micro-environment for the baby.
You get it, either in pill form or you get it as an injection; you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels.
About on average, a typical person is taking it 75 percent of the time.
It just doesn't happen to be right about the world.
But it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level.
It's called "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?"
But the truth of the matter is, you look at that car, it doesn't look like a Volvo, and it doesn't look like a Hummer.
Remarkably successful campaign, but notice the power of it.
Now, you may think to yourself, "Well, if my eyes depended on it, you know, I would obviously use it every day."
But the pain, the discomfort, you know, paying attention, remembering to put it in your purse when you go on a long trip: These are the day-to-day of life, and they do pose problems.
It's much easier to use, much less painful.
And I think to tackle it, we need to combine psychology, marketing, art, we've seen that.
No one would say, "Hey, I think this medicine works, go ahead and use it."
Lithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder, that a group in Italy found slowed ALS down in 16 patients, and published it.
I can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients, but I can say whether it works in Humberto.
But we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto.
So, we -- I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you that if you did it at a higher dose or if you run the study proper -- I can tell you that for those 69 people that took lithium, they didn't do any better than the people that were just like them, just like me, and that we had the power to detect that at about a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study.
So, the technology that I want to talk about is for the third world, for the developing world, but it has, I think, much broader application, because information is so important in the healthcare system.
There's an example of the same thing on a finger, showing you basically what it looks like.
One reason for using paper is that it's everywhere.
So, it's a solved problem, that particular problem is solved.
So, you take the drop of blood, no further manipulations, you put it on a little device, the device filters out the blood cells, lets the serum go through, and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there.
And the idea is that what one does, is to take the device, you dip it, you develop the color, you take a picture, the picture goes to a central laboratory.
It performs about equivalently to a system that's in the order of 100,000 dollars.
It costs 50 dollars. We can probably make it for 50 cents, if we put our mind to it.
It costs 50 dollars. We can probably make it for 50 cents, if we put our mind to it.
It is the only way you can start to fight cancer, is by catching it early.
See, evolution protected us during our childbearing years and then, after age 35 or 40 or 45, it said "It doesn't matter anymore, because they've had their progeny."
Because it's heterogeneous, and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer.
It starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells, what we call clonal selection.
So, one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer is that, right now, we describe it by a number of adjectives, symptoms: "I'm tired, I'm bloated, I have pain, etc."
So, it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer, and giving us a new lexicon, a new dictionary to describe it.
and it came back at 98.7, I would say, "Great."
You know, I've been using it for two and a half months.
It's a staggering device, not because it tells me how many kilocalories I do every day, but because it looks, over 24 hours, what I've done in a day.
It's used to treat osteoporosis, and they got that twice a year.
Six months later it's still gone.
They had to give it also in the U.S. to get approval, so I think there were three U.S. patients in upstate New York who were part of the trial.
And I keep it around for a couple of weeks, and I'm contemplating it, and I'll do another session with it and bring it up to another level, where all of this becomes the background, the depth of it.
I'm looking at it and making decisions: It needs more red, it needs more blue, it needs a different shape.
It just has so much in it.
And we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits: It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there, nobody was interested in irrigation projects.
To the contrary, we knew that this project would destroy the environment: It would destroy riparian forests, which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups, the Samburu and the Turkana in this area.
And yet, we all rejected this project, none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it, and it was the first project to be implemented.
It was even tax-deductible.
It costs way less than obesity now.
And the way I look at it is: If you don't have knives and forks in your school, you're purely endorsing, from a state level, fast food, because it's handheld.
And yes, by the way, it is fast food: it's wieners, it's pizzas, it's all of that stuff.
JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is, then they will never eat it.
It's in everything.
For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.
And for me, it's quite romantic, but it's about if one person teaches three people how to cook something, and they teach three of their mates, that only has to repeat itself 25 times, and that's the whole population of America.
Romantic, yes, but most importantly, it's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference.
It was able -- but only it was able -- to organize health care, education, policing, justice.
That is already happened; the information and Internet revolution has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways, but it hasn't, in every way, yet touched our government.
And it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description of why gross national product captures so little: It "does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play.
It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.
It measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile."
If you search for the word "technology," it was not used until 1952.
It was in 1829, and it was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum -- a course, bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts, and industry -- and he called it "Technology."
It was in 1829, and it was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum -- a course, bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts, and industry -- and he called it "Technology."
You can't do very much learning in your own life, it's so short, and there's nobody to pass on what you do learn.
It enabled us to actually eat all kinds of things.
It was sort of, in a certain sense, in a McLuhan sense, an external stomach, in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise.
That's what life is: It's an information process that was restructuring and making new order.
But we do know that the self-organization trend throughout the universe is long, and it began with things like galaxies; they maintained their order for billions of years.
In transportation, it's not to move us, it's to move the stuff that we make or buy.
It has an urge, and technology has an urge.
At the same time, it wants to give us things, and what it gives us is basically progress.
That conflict, that tension, will be with us forever, that sometimes it wants to do what it wants to do, and sometimes it's going to do things for us.
You try it out.
We fix it, but most importantly, we relocate it.
And what I mean by that is that we find a new job for it.
It's more than just gadgets; it's more than just things that people invent.
It's actually part of a very long story, a great story, that began billions of years ago.
That's enough to provide care to all the people in America who don't have it.
It doesn't seem to be working very well does it?
People -- for law to be the platform for freedom, people have to trust it.
But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties, because it carries with it the power of state.
Law has to be simple enough so that people can internalize it in their daily choices.
If they can't internalize it, they won't trust it.
If they can't internalize it, they won't trust it.
And how do you make it simple?
A free society requires red lights and green lights, otherwise it soon descends into gridlock.
It's now wired -- or I should say, wireless -- by taking the aggregate of these signals in the hospital, in the intensive care unit, and putting it on a smartphone for physicians.
Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway, as today many of these things are dedicated gateways, because they are not so well integrated.
That signal goes to the web, the cloud, and then it can be processed and sent anywhere: to a caregiver, to a physician, back to the patient, etc.
I didn't want to take my shirt off to show you, but I can tell you it's on.
This is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm, as you saw already, but it also goes well beyond that.
But this monitors food, it monitors activity and tracks weight.
The only thing it really tracks by itself is activity, and even then, it's not complete.
And here is the latest map. It was published just a little more than a week ago in the New York Times, and it isn't looking good.
Well, if you're building a bridge, details are pretty important because it will fall down if you ignore the details.
So, what is thinking in pictures? It's literally movies in your head.
And I came in half an hour beforehand so I could have it put on and kind of get used to it, and they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin.
Scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods -- that if the brain is older than four or five years of age, it loses its ability to learn -- because I don't think that idea has been tested adequately.
And the logo -- even though it looks extremely Irish, it's actually derived from the Indian symbol of Diya, an earthen lamp.
It has a very well-equipped pediatric ophthalmic center, which was made possible in part by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity.
If you show him real world images, if you show others like him real world images, they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over-fragmented; it's made up of a collage, a patchwork, of regions of different colors and luminances.
So the inference we are deriving from this, and several such experiments, is that dynamic information processing, or motion processing, serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing; it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition.
Because, if that hypothesis were to be true, it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what's causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype.
If they wanted beauty, I said, this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized.
It's jumped 20 years into 20-over game.
Princes patronize the game, not because they love the game, but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers.
Take a look: You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there, you could play it in a little alley -- you couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall; don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.
You could play it on the banks of the Ganges -- that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.
And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game, and we played it virtually every day.
Just as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it.
If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go, but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game.
And so England invented T20 cricket, and allowed India to hijack it.
It was never promoted, it was never sold -- it was organized.
They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn't actually love it; these were people who ran serious companies.
And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.
If you want to take the game around the world, it's got to be the shortest form of the game.
Hopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.
And instead of throwing it out, people would think that's a krump move, that's a krump move.
That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out, you throw it out, and you hold it.
And you just got this piece of energy and you just, you're manipulating it.
Every flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere looking at the Open Street Map, and realizing it could be better.
The map of Port au-Prince at the end of 2009 was not all it could be, not as good as the map of California.
After the earthquake, immediately, people all over the world, mappers who wanted to help, and could, looked at that imagery, built the map, quickly building it up.
Now, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth, you could actually buy the property, cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line, and then sell it off again.
It's 29,035 feet high.
It starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet.
And here's a picture in the icefall; it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly, and it actually changes every day.
When you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze; you can't even see over the top.
That way, it's less likely to tumble down on you.
There's no ice over it.
First, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis, it turns black, and then it falls off.
It was able to land on the ice, take away Beck and the other survivors, one by one, and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp.
We can see it in a variety of different organisms.
The researchers had to suit up just to enter it.
It's filled with this toxic gas, hydrogen sulfide.
And because you can't bind the oxygen, maybe you wouldn't consume it, and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen.
So, it was interesting for us when we applied hydrogen sulfide to a mouse when it was also cold because what happened is the core temperature of the mouse got cold.
It stopped moving.
It appeared dead.
It's rapidly metabolized, and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de-animation is simply put the thing out in room air, and it warms up, and it's none the worse for wear.
It's rapidly metabolized, and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de-animation is simply put the thing out in room air, and it warms up, and it's none the worse for wear.
And this company, the first thing it did was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide an injectable form that we could put in and send it out to physician scientists all over the world who work on models of critical care medicine, and the results are incredibly positive.
And if you think about the phone, right, it's something that we can use for some incredible ways to help people actually take the right medication at the right time.
He saw it written down somewhere. He's like, "Eric that's a really cool concept."
It's population-based.
It's just a mess today.
It's not that innovation and technology is going to be the magic pill that cures all, but it's going to be part of the solution.
And he said, "Son, it goes on forever."
But ultimately, what is a story? It's a contradiction.
It is finite; harmony is infinite.
It's thought that science can help us get what we value, but it can never tell us what we ought to value.
So the contributions of culture -- if culture changes us, as indeed it does, it changes us by changing our brains.
As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.
Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open, genuinely open for revision, does not make it vacuous.
But it clearly admits some exceptions.
It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing, and morality relates to that domain of facts.
So, Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size.
It's an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor.
This is what ARES looks like as it flies over Mars.
How do we get it to Mars?
We fold it, and we transport it in a spacecraft.
We put the folded airplane on the balloon -- it took about three hours to get up there -- and then we released it on command at 103,000 feet, and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly.
If you're interested in more information, we have a website that describes this exciting and intriguing mission, and why we want to do it.
Now, where is it?
If the rule of law is sound, it protects the poor and it protects the vulnerable.
MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof, and they've been slipping it in between music videos without any introduction, which I think is kind of fun.
And in a way, without us even noticing, has ended up standing on the precipice of its own extinction, waiting for us to give it a big boot and knock it over. And get rid of it.
And in a way, without us even noticing, has ended up standing on the precipice of its own extinction, waiting for us to give it a big boot and knock it over. And get rid of it.
I mean like once I pick up one book I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book.
We want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools.
Such beautiful food, I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful.
Such beautiful food, I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful.
They published my first book, "Flying Fingers," you see it here.
And from there on, it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools, keynoting to thousands of educators, and finally, today, speaking to you.
So, what we've got -- some people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much because, actually, treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV."
They were quite proud of the fact that you know, before the dust clears, if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back, they will be getting world-class triage emergency care faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the United States.
If it's the grape, they won't break it."
"If it's the raisin, they won't drop it."
It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful."
He's going to pick up a grape -- he didn't drop it, he didn't break it -- and he's going to eat it.
But you know what? It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous.
And I said to that kid, "I'll stop when your buddies are envious of your Luke arm because of what it can do, and how it does it.
It flips its body 180 degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall.
We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long-range motion.
And it deploys legs -- it looks almost like "Star Wars" -- when it lands, it absorbs the shock and starts walking.
What you see over here, this yellow thing, this is not a death ray.  This is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors -- because it is tall, it's 1.8 meters tall -- you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things.
So, think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel, but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub; so, it's a wheel-leg hybrid.
Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet, it's trying to walk over a changing terrain, a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes.
And just by the tactile information, it successfully crosses over these type of terrain.
But, when it encounters a very extreme terrain, in this case, this obstacle is more than three times the height of the robot, Then it switches to a deliberate mode, where it uses a laser range finder, and camera systems, to identify the obstacle and the size, and it plans, carefully plans the motion of the spokes and coordinates it so that it can show this kind of very very impressive mobility.
So, what it does, it has three legs. It's probably difficult to see, but it has a winch and a cable at the top -- and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot.
And then once it figures that out in real time, it calculates the force distribution: how much force it needs to exert to the surface so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.
Once it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot, and then with the winch it can climb up these kinds of thing.
So, this is actually based on that. This robot is called MARS: Multi-Appendage Robotic System. So, it's a hexapod robot.
It's trying to walk on the coarse terrain, sandy area, but depending on the moisture content or the grain size of the sand the foot's soil sinkage model changes.
Or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward. It's called ChIMERA.
This robot is a very recent project. It's called RAPHaEL.
In this case it's very intuitive; this student, probably his first time using it, doing very complex manipulation tasks, picking up objects and doing manipulation, just like that. Very intuitive.
It stands up, it walks -- very impressive.
It's a true actual goal. It's a very ambitious goal, but we truly believe that we can do it.
It's a true actual goal. It's a very ambitious goal, but we truly believe that we can do it.
Many times it's empty, sometimes I have something there -- if something's there, sometimes it's junk -- but most of the time I can't even read my handwriting.
It's being used now to track where counterfeit drugs have been made, where banknotes have come from, to look at the provenance of antiques and see that they really did come from the place the seller said they did.
It was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema.
She wrote this poem when she was 18 years old in 1888, and I look at it as kind of a very sweet feminist manifesto tinged with a little bit of defiance and a little bit of resignation and regret.
It is to explain death to a child, and it deserves a piece of plain-song music."
♫ Margaret, are you grieving ♫ ♫ Over Goldengrove unleaving, by and by? ♫ ♫ Leaves, like the things of man, you ♫ ♫ With your fresh thoughts care for, can you? ♫ ♫ But as the heart grows older ♫ ♫ It will come to such sights much colder ♫ ♫ By and by, nor spare a sigh ♫
Now, images have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion, ignorance, and in particular -- I've given a lot of talks on this but I'll just show one image -- In the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it.
Ansel Adams said, and I'm going to disagree with him, "You don't take a photograph, you make it."
Now, the average house has about 300 megawatt hours of embodied energy in it; this is the energy it takes to make it -- millions and millions of paper towels.
So first, we demolish it.
It takes some energy, but if you deconstruct it -- you take it all apart, you use the bits -- you can get some of that energy back.
Now, spray foam is an excellent insulator -- it fills in all the cracks -- but it is pretty high embodied energy, and, sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that.
And so if I run my new energy-efficient house forward, compared with the old, non-energy-efficient house, we make it back in about six years.
It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in -- if you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.
It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand.
The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing: It landed on the bottom in the rubble and -- fwoosh! -- vanished right before my eyes.
Anyway, there we were, staring at each other, and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system, and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.
He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- same thing.
And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure, forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth, until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals, reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone.
And it completely threw science on its head.
It made scientists rethink where life on Earth might have actually begun.
But you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead.
Five years later, come back, and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.
It's got living coral, fish all over the place, crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?"
The ocean has an amazing ability to recover, if we'll just leave it alone.
And if I were to write a volume, it would be called, "Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions" because my work, in understanding art and in understanding culture, has come by following artists, by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are.
It looked at the intersection of race and gender in contemporary American art.
It sought to express the ways in which art could provide a space for dialogue -- complicated dialogue, dialogue with many, many points of entry -- and how the museum could be the space for this contest of ideas.
What was significant about this exhibition is the way in which it engaged me in my role as a curator, as a catalyst, for this dialogue.
And she pointed to the work on the left to tell me how problematic this image was, as it related, for her, to the idea of how black people had been represented.
I am continually amazed by the way in which the subject of race can take itself in many places that we don't imagine it should be.
It's also about thinking about the creative spirit and nurturing it, and imagining, particularly in urban America, about the nurturing of the spirit.
Right after I completed my Ph.D., I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists that was using it for the first time as a tool for ocean exploration.
You can actually see it in surface waters.
He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals; one, the enzyme, he called luciferase; the substrate, he called luciferin after Lucifer the Lightbearer.
That terminology has stuck, but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms.
So, for example, this fish has a built-in headlight behind its eye that it can use for finding food or attracting a mate.
And then when it's not using it, it actually can roll it down into its head just like the headlights on your Lamborghini.
So, most animals make blue light, and most animals can only see blue light, but this fish is a really fascinating exception because it has two red light organs.
And I have no idea why there's two, and that's something I want to solve some day -- but not only can it see blue light, but it can see red light.
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope to be able to sneak up on animals that are blind to red light and be able to see them without being seen.
It's also got a little chin barbel here with a blue luminescent lure on it that it can use to attract prey from a long way off.
He has no lure for attracting food and no teeth for eating it when it gets there.
This fish is called the shining tubeshoulder because it actually has a tube on its shoulder that can squirt out light.
It's energetically very costly for this fish to do this, and we have no idea why it does it -- another one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved.
This is us chasing it in the submersible.
And so, the place that we took it to was this place called a Brine Pool, which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
For example, when I walked up here and I took the microphone from the stand and switched it on, you assumed this was a microphone, which it is not.
For example, when I walked up here and I took the microphone from the stand and switched it on, you assumed this was a microphone, which it is not.
And it makes a very bad microphone; I've tried it many times.  The other assumption that you made -- and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions.

They listen to the spirits like this -- I'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because, when she died, she had the family will, and she secreted it someplace. We don't know where it is, so we ask Granny, "Where is the will, Granny?"
Now, she could easily have said, "Oh, it's in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia," but she doesn't say that. No, she doesn't.
We paid a lot of money for that information, be we didn't get it.
And another claim that they make -- you'll love this one -- the more dilute the medicine is, they say, the more powerful it is.
We're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it.
It doesn't matter, it's spam.
Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.
I got this letter when I was first elected, and I still carry it to every council meeting I go to.
And, Leah adds with a grin, "Kavita, we especially are proud of our Christmas music, because it shows we are open to religious practices even though Catholic Church hates us LGBT."
Their concerts draw from their own communities, yes, but also from an older generation: a generation that might be suspicious of homosexuality, but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents.
So I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea.
Actually, I think it'll eventually be seen as probably the single biggest idea that's emerged in the past century.
It's the idea of computation.
It's really a very deep, very powerful, very fundamental idea, whose effects we've only just begun to see.
But if we keep running this for a while, we find out that although the pattern we get is very intricate, it has a very regular structure.
So, given our new kind of science, is there a general way to use it to make technology?
But in at least a large class of cases, one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network, which, when it gets big enough, behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid.
Build a team, open it up, offer prizes and so on.
Powered by my solar panels, it sucks in saltwater and turns it into freshwater.
It leaches out chemicals into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it, and then we come along and eat that poor critter, and we get some of the toxins accumulating in our bodies as well.
Yes, there have been the Exxon Valdezes and the Chernobyls, but mostly it's been an accumulation of bad decisions by billions of individuals, day after day and year after year.
And the other, of course, is a birth control pill, which, in a very simple way, fundamentally changed the structure of society by changing the role of women in it by providing to them the opportunity to make reproductive choices.
And here I've corrupted the Potter Stewart quotation by saying that we can think about something -- which spans all the way from scissors to the cell phone, Internet and birth control pills -- by saying that they're simple, the functions are simple, and we recognize what that simplicity is when we see it.
You can write papers about complexity, and the nice thing about complexity is it's fundamentally intractable in many ways, so you're not responsible for outcomes.  Simplicity -- all of you really would like your Waring Blender in the morning to make whatever a Waring Blender does, but not explode or play Beethoven.
The amazing thing about the cell is that it actually does maintain a fairly stable working relationship with other cells, but we don't know why.
And I'm going to use as an example the Internet, because it's a particularly good example of stacked simplicity.
We call it a complex system, which it is, but it's also something else.
We call it a complex system, which it is, but it's also something else.
The Internet starts with mathematics, it starts with binary.
So it is very, very simple once you learn how to read it.
It turns things on and off, but it does so without moving parts and it doesn't fail, basically, for a very long period of time.
But the point is that that extraordinary simple idea rests on layers of simplicity each compounded into a complexity that is itself simple, in the sense that it is completely reliable.
It's a little paper chip.
It has a few things printed on it using the same technology that you use for making comic books, which was the inspiration for this particular idea.
Or do you believe the people who tell you that aid is not going to help, on the contrary it might hurt, it might exacerbate corruption, dependence, etc.?
So now, I started from the big problem, and I couldn't answer it.
And I cut it into smaller questions, and I have the answer to these smaller questions.
So, first, it's mostly invisible; second, it's huge; and third, we don't know whether we are doing the right thing.
And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked, and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it.

Here's our new car: It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats. Buy our car.
When we can communicate from the inside out, we're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do.
Why would we use that verb, it doesn't "feel" right?
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job; it's to hire people who believe what you believe.
And when they went IPO, their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted, and it's never traded above 10.
In fact, I don't think it's even traded above six, except for a couple of little spikes.
And people who believed what he believed took his cause, and they made it their own, and they told people.
And this picture here, it's really interesting, it shows two things: First of all, it's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far, and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s, you took pictures in black and white.
The other thing it shows you is that, although there's this beautiful forest of coral, there are no fish in that picture.
It's a bit of an embarrassment.
It's subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it.
Now, I was paid in dollars as a consultant, and I looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself: "Is there a line in my return, which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible?
I was talking about social justice, and here I was, a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act -- of taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous, getting rent from that knowledge by sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and publishing them in the papers, getting invited to the conferences, getting consultancies and whatever have you.
What the honey bee does: it pollinates, takes nectar from the flower, pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.
And when it takes the nectar, the flowers don't feel shortchanged.
Can you tell me where has it been taken from, and what is it meant for? Anybody?
Is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture?
And the best part is that, while you use a costly non-stick pan, you eat the so-called Teflon or Teflon-like material because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?
It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that.  You know? But here in this clay hot plate, it will never go into your stomach.
So it is better, it is safer; it is affordable, it is energy-efficient.
So we have not yet cracked the problem of making it available as a rescue device, as a vending device during the floods in eastern India, when you have to deliver things to people in different islands where they're marooned.
And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it, it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.
If you have an idea, send it back to us."
So to invoke another metaphor, if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity -- I'm connected to you and you to her, on out endlessly into the distance -- this fabric is actually like an old-fashioned American quilt, and it has patches on it: happy and unhappy patches.
So we do this fun and profit-oriented inventing for most of what we do, but we also have a program where we invent for humanity -- where we take some of our best inventors, and we say, "Are there problems where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has?" -- and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems, which is with dramatic, crazy,
This lasts six months with no power; absolutely zero power, because it loses less than a half a watt.
Because if you open it up and reach inside, you'd let the heat in, the game would be over.
It vends out little individual vials.
And bed nets have an effect on the epidemic, but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets.
It's got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle; they have sex, they burrow into your liver, they tunnel into your blood cells ...
it's an incredibly complicated disease, but that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it and why we work on malaria: There's a lot of potential ways in.
One does an automatic malaria diagnosis in the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works: You take a drop of blood, you put it in there and it automatically tells you.
We can see it because of this molecule called hemozoin.
It's produced by the malaria parasite and it's a very interesting crystalline substance.
It nearly goes away in the dry season, because there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed.
And then, of course, the next year it comes roaring back.
In 1935, there were 150,000 cases a year of malaria in the United States, but DDT and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it.
Well, let's try to kill it with consumer electronics."
You could, if you're really smart, you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it, and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size.
Nathan Myhrvold: Okay, so our legal department prepared a disclaimer, and here it is.
So there is spill over; there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves that help people around them, while at the same time the reserve is protecting the entire habitat. It is building resilience.
I sell a product to a market that doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it.
This stuff is also really easy to relearn, provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning. Math reasoning -- we'll call it the application of math processes to the world around us -- this is hard to teach.
This is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.
all but ensures they won't retain it.
And the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students because, watch this, this is the practice problem set.
The question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.
And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms, not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks, we go out and we take a picture of it.
And it's filling up slowly, agonizingly slowly.
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia, because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation; to let students build the problem, because Einstein said so; and to finally, in total, just be less helpful,
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks.
The revolution is called angiogenesis, and it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels.
It does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances, stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis, such that, when we need a brief burst of blood vessels, the body can do this by releasing stimulators, proteins called angiogenic factors, that act as natural fertilizer, and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout.
So the body's ability to balance angiogenesis, when it's working properly, prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers.
And once those vessels invade the cancer, it can expand, it can invade local tissues, and the same vessels that are feeding tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases.
We had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week.
And the answer, to me, is obvious: we're treating cancer too late in the game, when it's already established, and oftentimes, it's already spread or metastasized.
This could help healthy people, as well as people who've already beaten cancer once or twice, and want to find a way to keep it from coming back.
The active ingredient is resveratrol, it's also found in red wine.
If you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor, it loses weight.
If you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor, it loses weight.
Stop the treatment, it gains the weight back.
Some years, the cold water goes all the way up to Brazil, and other years, in these La Nina years, it doesn't.
But the population is declining and it's declined fairly substantially, about 21 percent since 1987, when I started these surveys, in terms of number of active nests.
It walks over the pad, and you know who it is.
Most important thing is: Only you can change yourself, and only you can change the world and make it better, for people as well as penguins.
But what about oil? Where is it in the energy system?
Here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil, and it's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years.
Now, it's about 35 percent.
It's been declining and I believe it will continue to decline.
Now, I'm not pretending that energy use in total isn't increasing, it is -- that's another part of the story. Come talk to me about it, we'll fill in some of the details -- but there's a very important message here: This is 200 years of history, and for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system.

I picked it up outside of Marble Falls, Texas.
It's about 400 million years old.
And it's just limestone, nothing really special about it.
I picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger.
And it's different than this limestone, you can see that.
We're here today to announce the first synthetic cell, a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer, building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals, assembling that chromosome in yeast, transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species.
It also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code.
There were several steps to this. There were two sides: We had to solve the chemistry for making large DNA molecules, and we had to solve the biological side of how, if we had this new chemical entity, how would we boot it up, activate it in a recipient cell.
So in addition to doing the transplant, we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell.
When we did these experiments, though, we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell.
So what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it, we could then transplant it.
So the team developed new debugging software, where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type DNA.
So it took about three months to find that error and repair it.
And the first chromosome we built in 2008 -- the 500,000-base pair one -- we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code, but it was using just amino acid single letter translations, which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet.
It's a quote from the "American Prometheus" book on Robert Oppenheimer.
And four years later, it's been downloaded four million times.
So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something to get the number of people who've seen it.
We suppress it. You know, this is our policy.
No, it doesn't.
And we have sold ourselves into a fast-food model of education, and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies.
And the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't feed their spirit, it doesn't feed their energy or their passion.
We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process.
She's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga -- she loves it.
She's turning it inside out.
Her friend says, "Buy it already."
She said, "I'll buy it, but I'm also going to replicate it."
And then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve because Joe Blow owns it.
So, one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying, which is really what it is, is the establishment of trends.
Fashion, whether you like it or not, helps you project who you are to the world.
In Japan, for instance, which I think is the third largest market, they have a design law; it protects apparel, but the novelty standard is so high, you have to prove that your garment has never existed before, it's totally unique.
A person can come in and take somebody else's gown, cut off three inches from the bottom, go to the E.U. and register it as a new, original design.
You cannot copyright a recipe because it's a set of instructions, it's fact, and you cannot copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish.
Tattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool.
Tattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool.
It's a digital file.
It is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds.

Now, you might think of flu as just a really bad cold, but it can be a death sentence.
You know, the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically, it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic.
It spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms.
You took a pathogen, you modified it, you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened.
Memory B cells turn into plasma cells, which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch onto HIV to prevent it from infecting cells, while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected.
In this rendering of the flu virus, these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you.
It was easily transmitted, but, luckily, was pretty mild.
It mutates furiously, it has decoys to evade the immune system, it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome.
It mutates furiously, it has decoys to evade the immune system, it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome.
In addition, these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab onto, and what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates.
It's like, as many times as the virus changes its clothes, it's still wearing the same socks, and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks.
Of course, the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it.
This vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria, E. coli.
Stage two, social remix, is really about using it to mediate people's relationships to each other.
It's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well.
I actually jumped in and photographed this, and with the fisherman's permission, I cut the turtle out, and it was able to swim free.
They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet.
But I think to set the scene, I want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED, but it is a bit of a mess.
But actually, it's not my fault; it's from the Guardian newspaper.
Because, if I'm going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration, I should tell you how much it costs.
The first thing I want to say, and this is straight from "Wonders of the Solar System," is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful.
It's about 500 kilometers in diameter.
this an unprocessed picture, by the way, I should say, it's black and white, straight from Saturnian orbit.
It may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask, which is: "Are we alone in the universe?"
What's also not often said about the space exploration, about the Apollo program, is the economic contribution it made.
I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this, it cost a lot, didn't it?

It's called "helios" -- helios from the Sun.
You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory, get a telescope, swing it to the sky, and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.
It's part of that galaxy, and it's shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns in it.
And it has a binary companion that goes around it, so a big star, a big ball of gas.
And it has a binary companion that goes around it, so a big star, a big ball of gas.
And what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star, until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit, and then it explodes.
And it explodes, and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks, and releases, not only energy, but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe.
It looks like Saturn because, of course, it is.
It's currently 10 billion miles away from Earth, transmitting with that dish, with the power of 20 watts, and we're still in contact with it.
Now it's very hard to see the Earth there, it's called the "Pale Blue Dot" picture, but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light.
And it's made today in these difficult economic times.
So the machine would get started, it would travel some distance, reacting along the way, hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback.
And speaking of synchronization, they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way.
Okay.  They wanted it to end precisely on time.
It took us 85 takes to get it on film to our satisfaction.
And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use" and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.
And it's actually in the machine.
It doesn't matter what temperature it is, doesn't matter what's in its way; it will pretty much get where it needs to go.
Namibia has got 2.1 million people, but it is only twice the size of California.
Walk up to it and smack it on the backside."
Puff up and just look it in the eye and it may not want to fight you."
And we are able to use this money for many things: Very importantly, we put it in education.
Secondly, we put it for infrastructure. Food.
It's frankly more memorable than all those millions of hotels we've all stayed at that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated at a cost of 500,000 dollars, in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you've ever stayed in in the entire course of your life.
And once you have a very, very large budget, you actually look for expensive things to spend it on.
One of them also being, although logically it's quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it, if it only serves two floors, it's actually bloody terrifying, okay?
It wants the world to be the kind of place where the input and the change are proportionate.
The people who actually have no money, who have no extravagant budget, but who realize that actually you might achieve greater success in uptake of a government program by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay, but you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect simply by redesigning the form and writing it in comprehensible English.
And if it isn't easily gotten, we'll go ahead and steal it.
It's just as well, because it can stay where it is.
While the carbon dioxide, vast quantities of it, gigatons, goes into the atmosphere where we can't get it back -- yet -- and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about.

Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller.
You can make it reliable, as I showed with that diagram.
And so the fallacy that we need this resource and we can actually make it in a time frame that is meaningful is not possible.
It actually improves it.
If they liked an aria, they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore, not at the end of the show, but immediately.
It's smaller than this.
And I'm saying, well, the passion's still there, but the vessel that it's going to be injected into and poured into, that is instinctively and intuitively created first.
It's just like this one, completely worthless, in which it allegedly worked by "electrostatic magnetic ion attraction," which translates to "pseudoscientific baloney" -- would be the nice word -- in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good, but it does absolutely nothing.

Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise, once clockwise and peck the key twice.
A Type I error, or false positive, is believing a pattern is real when it's not.
A Type II error is not believing a pattern is real when it is.
Well, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind, you've made an error in cognition, made a Type I error, false positive.
On the other hand, if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind, and it turns out it's a dangerous predator, you're lunch.
Yes, there it is. And there's the prime.
If it's too low, you're more likely to make too many Type II errors.
Kay, now can you see anything?  Pull it so you can't even see down.  Woman: It's completely blind now, right?
Rights management is no longer simply a question of ownership, it's a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape.
The "JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance" became so popular that NBC parodied it on the season finale of "The Office," which just goes to show, it's truly an ecosystem of culture.
It's because it's a big problem, and it's complicated and messy.
This is a picture of a trainer's whistle, a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin it's done the right thing and can come get a fish.
When a male dolphin leaves Mom, it will often join up with another male and form an alliance, which may last for decades.
It was tracked for 43 days, swimming 1,700 kilometers, or more than 1,000 miles.
The west coast calls became more and more popular, until by 1998, none of the whales sang the east coast song; it was completely gone.
And as a young kid, nobody can say it can't happen because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out.
Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.
All three of the founders of Netscape had it.
I remember being told to walk out in the middle of a street in Banff, Alberta because I'd thrown a penny out in the street, and my dad said, "Go pick it up."
When Steve Jurvetson and Jim Clark and Jim Barksdale have all got it, and they built Netscape -- imagine if they were given Ritalin.
It's a video that was done by one of the companies that I mentor.
It's about kids. It's about entrepreneurship.
With the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old, in 1987, I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre, a very impractical name, because I actually was looking to create joy of life.
And it focuses on something I read long ago from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.
But it doesn't count the health of our children or the integrity of our public officials.
But I find that for myself, without exception, the more I deal with the work as something of my own, as something that is personal, the more successful it is as something that's compelling, interesting and sustaining.
And as you can see, it's extremely difficult to read.
And these were created without sketches, just freehand, by putting the sugar down on a white surface and then manipulating it to get the words and designs out of it.
And I drew each person their own unique valentine and put their name on it and numbered it and signed it and sent it out.
So that's why I do what I do, and why I spend so much time and effort on it, and why I work in the commercial, public sphere, as opposed to the isolated, private sphere of fine art: because I want as many people as possible to see my work, notice it, be drawn into it, and be able to take something from it.

Because actually radical innovation does sometimes come from the very best, but it often comes from places where you have huge need -- unmet, latent demand -- and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work -- traditional, high-cost solutions, which depend on professionals, which is what schools and hospitals are.
It's not to do with electricity or water.
Learning has to be productive in order for it to make sense.
And finally, they have a different model of scale, and it's a Chinese restaurant model of how to scale.
And I learned it from this guy, who is an amazing character.
You should turn it into McDonald's.
They know what to expect, even though it'll be subtly different and the colors will be different and the name will be different.
You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it.
It's recognizably 19th century in its roots.
And of course it will bring great things.
It will bring skills and learning and reading.
But it will also lay waste to imagination.
It will lay waste to appetite. It will lay waste to social confidence.
It will stratify society as much as it liberates it.
And as a special treat, he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands.
It's totally appropriate for a four-year-old.
That's all it is, but that's all that's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population -- everybody knows where the violence is, but no one person knows what everyone knows -- and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it, and it maps it and it makes it public.
And it represents the ability of the world's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large, sometimes global, projects.
Here is the site in 1940: It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville.
By 1980, it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right.
It's providing 1,500 households with the option of a more urban lifestyle.
And so it's giving people more choices, but it's not taking away choices.
We don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.
It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.
And that pyramid in Monterey, right now, because of the efforts of a lot of different people, is functioning better than it's ever functioned for the last 150 years.
Roughness is part of human life forever and forever, and ancient authors have written about it.
It was very much uncontrollable, and in a certain sense, it seemed to be the extreme of complexity, just a mess, a mess and a mess.
Because old and ancient as it may be, it's very complicated and it's very simple, both at the same time.
If you try to weigh it -- of course it's very easy to weigh it, and when you eat it, the weight matters -- but suppose you try to measure its surface.
It was 1.48.
So what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung, but it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale, for a man and for a little rodent.
In particular, it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane.
It was very easy, and you can write many books very fast about it.
We did this bag for Haiti, and we launched it just a month after the earthquake to provide school meals for kids in Haiti.
It's very consolidated, and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat.
But the world has changed, and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it.
Do it well and get used to it.
And the same thing with the atmosphere: If you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball, you would get that little sphere of gas on the right.
Now in the laboratory, if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is -- not 8.1, which is the normal pH of seawater -- but 7.5, it dissolves in about three days.
If you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1, put it in a pH of 7.7 -- not a huge change -- it becomes deformed and dies.
If you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1, put it in a pH of 7.7 -- not a huge change -- it becomes deformed and dies.
You can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface, and then it is attacked, because they don't want the evidence, in my opinion.
I don't know if it'll affect the adults.
They don't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated.
It really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there because it's our government, meant to protect the larger public interest.
Who says it's too expensive?
It's an issue that is moral right now.
Well, it uses sexual reproduction.
You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.
You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc.
And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress, you can actually throw it into reverse.
Go back to this image again and ask yourself, not only who made it and for who, but who knew how to make it.
Go back to this image again and ask yourself, not only who made it and for who, but who knew how to make it.
In the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it.
I am of course quoting from a famous essay by Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s, called "I, Pencil" in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made, and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil, because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite, and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing.
It turns out that, not only is the Galvao parrot very attractive, useful for headdresses, it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties, which means that there's a terrible problem with Galvao abuse.
It's extremely lumpy.
It's getting more connected.
It's called "Dhani Tackles the Globe."
Each time, my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic, take a red apple and stab it with as many rose thorns as the number of warts she wanted to remove.
"I liked your book," he said, "but I wish you had written it differently."
Many authors feel this pressure, but non-Western authors feel it more heavily.
I want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is, not as a means to an end.
If it cannot take us there, it is not good literature.
And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi, who was the richest man -- still is the richest man -- in Kenya.
CA: And -- I mean, to cut a long story short -- word of the report leaked into Kenya, not from the official media, but indirectly, and in your opinion, it actually shifted the election.
So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception.
It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all, and that's our hope.
The material looks good, it feels right, but we just can't verify it."
The material looks good, it feels right, but we just can't verify it."
Is it really yours?"
So this phrase is not, not as nice as it used to be.
And people came up and picked up the culturally resonant image of the falafel, ate it and, you know, talked and left.
We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols, like the falafel, can be misunderstood because of baggage, and where religion can be twisted and purposefully made where it's not supposed to be by others.
The telescope is actually built similarly to the, well-known to you, Hubble Space Telescope, except it does have an additional lens -- a wide-field lens, as you would call it as a photographer.
And here comes biology -- biology, with its basic question, which still stands unanswered, which is essentially: "If there is life on other planets, do we expect it to be like life on Earth?"
So the question is: is that chemical phenomenon universal, or is it something which depends on the planet?
Is it like gravity, which is the same everywhere in the universe, or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries wherever we find them?
And let's compare it to the rest of the world in spatial terms.
So life might be insignificant in size, but it is not insignificant in time.
Whether it's something simple like turning on the lights with a switch, or even as complex as programming robotics, we have always had to give a command to a machine, or even a series of commands, in order for it to do something for us.
It doesn't require any scalp preparation, no conductive gel or paste.
It's also wireless, so it gives you the freedom to move around.
But the solution is animal tissue because it's plentiful, it's cheap, you can get it from young, healthy tissues, but the barrier is immunology.
But the solution is animal tissue because it's plentiful, it's cheap, you can get it from young, healthy tissues, but the barrier is immunology.
We would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient's knee.
We've now done that procedure, and it's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases, so it's an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way to regrow the meniscus.
It's by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it , and then we can put it back into a patient's knee.
We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface.
Well, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it, I ordered a cup of coffee, which the waiter brought over promptly.
First assumption: if a choice affects you, then you should be the one to make it.
It leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.
It requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self-defining act.
Instead of making better choices, we become overwhelmed by choice, sometimes even afraid of it.
It's not a marker of liberation, but of suffocation by meaningless minutiae.
It lays the world at your feet and says, "You can have anything, everything."
It's a great story, and it's understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it.
It's called Seals as Sentinels.
When the oil gets into the marshes, you can't get it out.
You can see it getting up into the mangrove, but it is not harming the corals or the sea grass, right.
And if you're a fish, and you haven't gotten your glob in the morning, you're going to get it in the afternoon, because they've got your number.
And I'm part of a chat group, which is a national group of toxicologists and chemists that are, you know, basically turning cartwheels trying to figure out what's in this stuff, and what is it doing and what are the interactions of these chemicals, most of which we don't know, and what are their byproducts, which are usually more toxic than the parent compound.
It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific.
It's the whole planet, the entire planet, continents and oceans together.
It's immensely complex.
How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money if they don't actually use it?
And while that swim took place three years ago, I can remember it as if it was yesterday.
And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers, and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know, we're made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands, and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst.
So it's right up in the heavens.
Population growth's important, but it's also about how much each person consumes.
Buy it.
When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect -- it was called Natal -- I was inspired, and I thought for a moment, maybe it's possible to address that one problem of storytelling, to create a character which seemed alive, which noticed me, that could look me in the eyes and feel real, and sculpt a story about our relationship.
Do you want Milo to squash it?
Dimitri: Go on, Milo. Squash it.
He said, "Go on, Milo. Squash it."
That means Milo's mind, as millions of people use it, will get smarter and cleverer.
In fact, they were so successful that you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD, even before it was released in the Middle East.
"Your grandfather has a parking violation. It's way overdue.
"Try the yogurt. It's very good. Little expensive."
The reason that it's so important is that, the last decade, what we've seen has been building the social layer, has been this framework for connections, and construction on that layer is over, it's finished.
There's still a lot of people who are trying to figure out social and how do we leverage this and how do we use this, but the framework itself is done, and it's called Facebook.
And so when you want to build on the social layer, the framework has been decided; it is the Open Graph API.
This game dynamic is so powerful that it doesn't just influence our behavior, it's influenced our entire culture.
It also exists in more conventional game forms.
And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it?
See that gap there? There's a gap, and it affects all the other stories.
You see where it starts? September 2001, when we had something very real to be scared about.
Over the years, online, we've laid down a huge amount of information and data, and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity, and it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments.
But if you look at it directly, it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts.
But if you look at it directly, it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts.
It's being poured into our eyes through the Web, and we're all visualizers now; we're all demanding a visual aspect to our information.
It has the same bandwidth as a computer network.
It loves them, and it calls them beautiful.
The data is all stored in a Google Doc, and it's literally generating itself from that data.
But it can go beyond data, and it can go beyond numbers.
This is a visualization of the political spectrum, an attempt for me to try and understand how it works and how the ideas percolate down from government into society and culture, into families, into individuals, into their beliefs and back around again in a cycle.
What I love about this image is it's made up of concepts, it explores our worldviews and it helps us -- it helps me anyway -- to see what others think, to see where they're coming from.
It records the annual rise and fall of greenhouse gases and temperatures going back before the onset of the last ice ages.
The wind that rubs against it gives it voice.
It's just a big blue surface.
Or this fangtooth. The particles in the water make it look like it's floating in outer space.
It can change its body into a big, intimidating fish in a matter of seconds.
What I'm trying to tell readers is that plastic doesn't really go away; it just continues to wash downstream.
And it ended up in the Boise River and then on to the Columbia River and then to the mouth of the Columbia and to the Pacific Ocean and then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch -- which is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific, where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around -- and then back onto the lagoon.
So you go back into the room, and you break this thing to pieces, and you haul it away.
It takes off. It's a big woosh.
It starts of with the very small ones, which are one carbon, four hydrogen -- that's methane -- it just floats off.
Oil doesn't sink, it floats.
If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water.
It spreads out to be really thin, so you have a hard time corralling it.
And every single oil is different when it hits water.
When the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969, it formed the environmental movement in its modern form.
It started Earth Day.
It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act.
In fact, it's continued to increase.
It's the same with brands: the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has, the more force is needed to change its positioning.
So this says that it's impossible, by definition, to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position -- and the momentum of a particle, because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.
So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it, then the photon of light has momentum, which knocks the particle, so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.
By measuring it, the act of measurement changes it.
By measuring it, the act of measurement changes it.
The act of observation changes it.
So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle, because the observation changes it.
So next, the scientific method -- an axiom of physics, of all science -- says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation, you can only disprove it.
What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning, and it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.
So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis, but it's easy to disprove it -- any hypothesis is shaky.
It's part of the fight and flight mechanism, that when an animal is frightened -- think of a deer.
It's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness, and it's not nearly as important as love.
We all have one planet. We all have to share it.
It is the ultimate scarce resource, the one planet that we share.
It might be Latin American.
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it.
We're the first generation -- thanks to science -- to be informed that we may be undermining the stability and the ability of planet Earth to support human development as we know it.
You have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it.
The only phase, as we know it that can support humanity.
It may get locked in an undesired state, because it changes color, absorbs more energy, and the system may get stuck.
It has to basically do this on current land.
For real -- you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it.
So this strategy has served it pretty well -- it's 2,400 years old.
However, it died in the lab as they were determining its age.
This plant is called the Welwitschia, and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola, where it's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea.
And what's more, it's actually a tree.
I connected high speed internet to it -- it's about three feet off the ground -- turned it on and left it there.
I connected high speed internet to it -- it's about three feet off the ground -- turned it on and left it there.
So when they spoke into it, the computer typed out gibberish, so they said, "Well, it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying."
They would, you know, throw it back at you.
If you leave it on the pavement and if all the adults go away, then they will show off with each other about what they can do.
Self-organizing systems also always show emergence, which is that the system starts to do things, which it was never designed for.
He just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?"
I said, "It's a prize from [an] art competition."
What I did here, I just put like 10 feet [of] paper then put a coconut rope, and just burnt it.
But if you tear it in the middle -- now, I didn't touch this breadth, but still, the meaning of this changes.
And if they say it's solid, it will not be solid, it will evaporate.
It's called "Emerging Angel."
We see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark, but it's filled with light all the time.
When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.
When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.
But if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it, you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints, and the footprints are nothing but passing time.
It was a complicated thing, and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was.
Because it's partly floating, you can imagine, is sea level rises a little bit, the ice lifts off the bed, and then it can break off and float north.
And now we know that in our recent past it melted back and formed again, and sea level went up and down, six meters at a time.
And so, when a coral colony is killed by an El Nino event, it leaves this indelible record.
Now the reason we know it's 1584 is that these corals have growth bands.
It was cooling down until about 1900 or so.
It's based on hundreds of hours of research, of practice.
It's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it.
I'll give you an example -- if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach, and you fly it all the way across the continent, and you drop it into a sloped cage, it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores, and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away.

It'll do this for weeks, until it kind of gradually loses the plot.
And in humans, we call it the "body clock."
It's a huge driver for culture and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior.
It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.
It's used in paint for the texture, but also for the glossiness.
And once it's in the right spot, they remove the outer shell, and the heart valve, well, it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating, instantly.
It was a space, as Matt Ridley talked about, where ideas could have sex.
The problem is, if you buy a $40,000 incubator, and you send it off to a mid-sized village in Africa, it will work great for a year or two years, and then something will go wrong and it will break, and it will remain broken forever, because you don't have a whole system of spare parts, and you don't have the on-the-ground expertise to fix this $40,000 piece of equipment.
And so what you realize is that Darwin, in a sense, had the idea, he had the concept, but was unable of fully thinking it yet.
It will be useful in 2020.
And I'll leave you with this story, which I think captures a lot of these values, and it's just wonderful kind of tale of innovation and how it happens in unlikely ways.
It was right at 20 MHz, so you could pick it up really easily, because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax, basically.
So they made it really easy to find it.
We should record it."
30 years later, Ronald Reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform that anybody could kind of build upon and anybody could come along and build new technology that would create and innovate on top of this open platform, left it open for anyone to do pretty much anything they wanted with it.
And we open bank accounts for them and they're paid directly into the accounts, because their money's protected; the men can't take it away from them.
It was at that point, just the spark of an idea.
It's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good.
Another thing it's good for is navigation -- it can guide you around in a city.
It can tell you by its weight, "Okay, move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here."
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right -- I don't have to check it.
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right -- I don't have to check it.
And you can tell, it's relaxed right now.
Oh now, missed call, a new call, new girlfriend maybe -- very exciting.  How do we calm it down?
You give it a pat behind the ears, and everything is all right again.
And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught.
It reduces everything down to what's relevant and it discards everything that's not relevant.
It's got no destination in mind -- it's just enjoying the journey.
We squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this.
First, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy; it's also now being used to treat cancer.
First, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy; it's also now being used to treat cancer.
It's been around for thousands of years.
It tracks your movement through space.
It is, as you can see, very small and also very cheap.
What should it be for?
Some people will say it's for biometric security.
Some people will say it's for public health research.
Some people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research.
I'd like to tell you that it's also for self-knowledge.
And the self isn't the only thing; it's not even most things.
And so when the green neuron wants to communicate, it wants to send a message to the red neuron, it spits out neurotransmitter.
Because if you look at a brain with your naked eye, you don't really see how complex it is, but when you use a microscope, finally the hidden complexity is revealed.
For now, let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis, that it's actually worth taking seriously.
It's like the water of the stream; it never sits still.
Because people don't have tools to cope with it, to get over it.
The desperate try to restore order and normality, and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence, it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt.
I thought it was an idea worth spreading, and I think it must be, can be, could be replicated elsewhere.
We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975, and the women who organized it said, "We only want to lend to women who practice family planning.
And after 35/36 years, it's still going on.
It's a part of the Village Development Bank; it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit.
And we didn't need a big organization to run it -- it was run by the villagers themselves.
And we didn't need a big organization to run it -- it was run by the villagers themselves.
It's not a free gift.
And that's not the only place it's found.
Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment -- on the side of the road or next to a river.
If it's not picked up by a human, like me and you, it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years.
Perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans, like in the great plastic gyre, where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits, but they're not really going away.
When a tree's done using its leaves -- its solar collectors, these amazing molecular photon capturing devices -- at the end of a season, it doesn't pack them up, take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves.
It just drops them, the shortest distance possible, to the forest floor, where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil.
It's around about 770 grams of carbon.
And this engine is not just economic value; it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system, driven by our own insatiable appetites, driven in fact by a sense of anxiety.
And to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades, we've expanded the money supply, expanded credit and debt, so that people can keep buying stuff.
It was fished sustainably till all of time, except for our generation.
It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it.
And then, better yet, we've got our own version of tuna whisperers, our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton, who can take a big tuna and in one motion, put it into an envelope of water, so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea.
Jeff and Jason there, are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.
And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.
We bring the tuna out, we measure it.
We put water over its gills, give it oxygen.
And when it goes, we're always happy.
That's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring -- but it can't get there. It's too cold.
we can actually keep it calm, put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag.
And when we do and it swims, we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from California to Hawaii.
Then it just took another three months for [the] U.N. to get it into their server, and on Friday we got the new trend line -- it was down here.
This page is very bad; it's a categorization of countries.
It labels "developing countries," -- I can read from the list here -- developing countries: Republic of Korea -- South Korea.
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.
It's not too big -- about the size of a golf ball.
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.
But before I show you what's inside, I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.
It will bring all of your family together.
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty.
It was a rare gem -- a brain tumor, hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving.
I'm not sure you'd want it.
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn't expect in all the ways I just shared with you.
So the next time you're faced with something that's unexpected, unwanted and uncertain, consider that it just may be a gift.
It's a nice description because it's starting from left -- you have the stones -- immediately after the stones, the plants that are just able to live.
And so if you need to study this sleeping problem, it's easy to study on plants, for example, than in animals and it's much more easy even ethically.
And this region, it's a very small region -- it's less than one millimeter.
You can remove 90 percent of the Internet and it is [continuing] to work.
Coke's success is relevant, because if we can analyze it, learn from it, then we can save lives.
Coke's success is relevant, because if we can analyze it, learn from it, then we can save lives.
It's a lot like other consumer companies.
Well, it's aspirational.
It is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live.
Well, it's based on avoidance, not aspirations.
But what we're finding around the world, over and over again, is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there, it doesn't get used.
But what we're finding around the world, over and over again, is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there, it doesn't get used.
Luckily, the genetic testing proved that, in fact, this strand came north, because, had it come from the south, it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.
This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster in decades, and it was not a natural disaster -- it was a disaster of engineering.
If you look at this building in Chile, it's ripped in half, but it's not a pile of rubble.
It won't cost us any more to do it the right way."
The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building, where the walls are tied together, the building is symmetric, and it will stand up to an earthquake.
And then you have to introduce your tadpole and who it's named after.
Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality, or to understand it or to change it, the benefits are enjoyed by anyone you share that water quality or air quality with.
When we put it through our solar chimney, we remove actually about 95 percent of that.
Do you know what slows it down?
And what I like to think of is this is an interface that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems, specifically by changing who has information, where they have it, who can make sense of that information, and what you can do about it.
In this case, instead of throwing chewing gum, or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with that's in the middle of the city, and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution, it's actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds.
But in that action, that interaction, by re-scripting that, by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate, that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent, which, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally, binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat
It's beautiful, isn't it?
He died long after he left the pillow at my house, but we never got around to returning it."
And I was protecting the project from it, I realized. I was protecting it -- I didn't want this special, little group of photographs to get sullied in some way.
We sent it over to Uganda.
It changed the way our history developed.
But it's a technology so pervasive, so invisible, that we, for a long time, forgot to take it into account when we talked about human evolution.
It's technology.
But it shrunk to 60 percent of primate gut of my body mass.
How did it actually interfere?
It penetrates the mucosa.
Now if you think about the gut, the gut is -- if you could stretch it -- 40 meters long, the length of a tennis court.
If we could unroll it, get out all the folds and so on, it would have 400 sq. meters of surface.
If we could unroll it, get out all the folds and so on, it would have 400 sq. meters of surface.
So if we give you a specification, this brain, which is autonomous, have 500 million nerve cells, 100 million neurons -- so around the size of a cat brain, so there sleeps a little cat -- thinks for itself, optimizes whatever it digests.
It has 20 different neuron types.
It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain, where you have 100 billion neurons.
It has autonomous organized microcircuits, has these programs which run.
It senses the food; it knows exactly what to do.
It senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means, because it has to move the food -- it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion.
And then finally, it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery, which actually digests the food we cook.
I took here a model from robotics -- it's called the Subsumption Architecture.
It can replace, or it can inhibit actually, signals.
It's a very big signal; it's sent to the brain says, "Go and eat."
Despite generating a healthy hunger signal, the big brain ignores it and activates different programs in the gut.
It actually takes the signal and changes it, and we continue, even [though] our eight signals would say, "Stop, enough.
It actually takes the signal and changes it, and we continue, even [though] our eight signals would say, "Stop, enough.
Now if we could take this language -- and this is a language of structures -- and make it longer-lasting, that it can go through the passage of the intestine, it would generate stronger signals.
Now if we could take this language -- and this is a language of structures -- and make it longer-lasting, that it can go through the passage of the intestine, it would generate stronger signals.
It's ephemeral just like us."
It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits, because it's always still plastic.
And my intention was to go out to the gyre, raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic, chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities.
I know it's a cliche, but look, look how small, how tiny it has gotten.
It has empowered you, it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well.
It has rocked the music industry; it has changed the way we consume music.
And it has changed the way your future employer will look at your application.
This is your life, enjoy it.
It is one lakh, 100,000 rupees, and you are to make it within that."
And therefore, the standard process, where you develop a molecule, put it into mice, into men, are not yielding those results -- the billions of dollars that have been spent.
The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down.
But then he held it for a little while, Lakshmi.
It has parallel lines, which are sun rays.
It makes them meet.
But to make it more real, if the price of an automobile had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power, you could buy a car today for five dollars.
And that soft power has been much neglected and much misunderstood, and yet it's tremendously important.
If you ask how is power distributed in the world today, it's distributed much like a three-dimensional chess game.
But it is more than just a repository of our resources; it's also the global geography of the communion we call dinner.
What damage [does] it actually inflict on the plant?
This adult pierces the thrips, sucking it within just several minutes, just going to the other prey, continuing all over the place.
The really interesting stuff about virtuality is what you can measure with it.
It's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up.
And we developed techniques to dive inside and under the iceberg, such as heating pads on our kidneys with a battery that we dragged around, so that, as the blood flowed through our kidneys, it would get a little boost of warmth before going back into our bodies.
So it's a deep -- think about it in a big three-dimensional space, very deep three-dimensional space with herds of tuna, whales, all kinds of deep sea marine life like we've seen here before.
Remember, a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface.
The ocean heated up as it does sometimes, and the hot spot formed and stalled right over the Phoenix Islands for six months.
I control the brain in order to understand how it works.
Now wait a minute, you may say, how can you go straight to controlling the brain without understanding it first?
In other words, instead of recording the activity of neurons, we need to control it.
So in this cartoon, the bluish white cell in the upper-left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light-activated pore.
The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them, but it can't actually take off because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates.
Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly to a flash it could see, Susana did a simple but brutally effective experiment.
Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odor streams meet, it has to make a decision.
It has to decide whether to turn around and stay in the same odor, or whether to cross the midline and try something new.
In other words, the fly should learn from mistakes that it thought it had made but, in reality, it had not made.
I don't know about you, but I find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate and give rise to a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind, even if it's the mind of the fly.
And there's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience, especially when it's half-finished.
And in the audio world that's when the microphone gets too close to its sound source, and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound.
It doesn't have a name yet.

It's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students.
And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams, one team on each side of the playground, and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires.
It's hands-on, it's in-your-face, it requires an active engagement, and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways.
And the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public -- that's the final exam.
It's one project per year, and it makes the youth the biggest asset and the biggest untapped resource in imagining a new future.
What I will focus on in my talk is why they matter, how they matter, and what we can all do to make sure that they continue to matter in the right ways, that is, how all of us can contribute to developing and honing the skills of local and global leaders to make peace and to make it last.
The number of people killed in civil wars also is much lower today than it was a decade ago or two.
It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise, and it needs to ensure that a broad coalition of local, regional and international supporters help them implement their agreement.
On this piece of paper is the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family.
It began carrying, among other things, a large number of hunters who began the wholesale killing of buffalo, eliminating a source of food and clothing and shelter for the Sioux.
Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee, I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux, but as a grave for all indigenous peoples.
We buy it for our kids.
And the real problem with the global supply chain is that it's supranational.
You have a custodial duty, a duty of care, to make sure that that product gets from wherever to the store in a way that allows us to consume it, without fear of our safety, or without having to sacrifice our conscience to consume that product."
And this is what happens to that food web when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before.
So to explain that, let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education.
It's done by geologists, engineers, biologists, all sorts of different people -- modeling and simulation.
It's actually very popular.
And another thing about math: math sometimes looks like math -- like in this example here -- and sometimes it doesn't -- like "Am I drunk?"
Why is it such an important part of education as a sort of compulsory subject?
And then finally, turn it back to the real world.
It's the chore.
It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.
It's a means to an end, not an end in itself, and automation allows us to have that machinery.
Are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it, or design it for that matter?
Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem, actually make it more conceptual.
Now, of course, like any great tool, they can be used completely mindlessly, like turning everything into a multimedia show, like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand, where the computer was the teacher -- show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand.
Programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days, and it's also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand.
And experience of harder problems -- being able to play with the math, interact with it, feel it.
And experience of harder problems -- being able to play with the math, interact with it, feel it.
Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate, but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts, however hard the calculating.
Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math, but what I am sure is it's the mainstream subject of the future.
And we get it not from a philosopher of art, not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic.
It's in the eye of the beholder.
It's whatever moves you personally.
It did not evolve for natural survival.
No, it's deep in our minds.
It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors.
All you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit, and come up with something that does help, that does work.
It was a fairy tale, and then we retired.
When the turbine drops in, it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity, day and night.
And as long as we're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water -- you're all really smart, just do the math.
They know how to plant organic rice, they know how to look after it, they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it.
The Green School effect -- we don't know what it is.
It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world, but many people believe that it's the most beautiful.
It's a model we built for Bali.
It is, in theory, the global commons, belonging to us all.
But in reality, it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it.
But in reality, it is managed by and for those who have the resources to go out and exploit it.
We can use the same technologies that fishers use to identify where the species are, in order to close the area when it's most vulnerable, which may, in some cases, be year-round.
It's helping to bring an incredible group of talented people together to really try to solve and penetrate these problems that have created our obstacles to management and rational use of this area that was once so far away and remote.
So on this tour, I hope I provided you with a new perspective of the high seas: one, that it is our home too, and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.
It requires only a change in consciousness, and that can be any one of a number of symptoms, including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy, hearing a ringing in your ear, being more impulsive or hostile than usual.
It's at CDC.gov.
It's a great place to start if you have questions.
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared.
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared.
I went back to my bed, and I prayed, and I secretly thanked God that that missile did not land on my family's home, that it did not kill my family that night.
I grew up with the colors of war -- the red colors of fire and blood, the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces and the piercing silver of an exploded missile, so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it.
If not, it goes into the toilet.
I just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until I got the size I want.
We're getting tired of it. It's kind of cliched now.
So if you put it in the front door, your design fails.
So don't put it in the front door; put it somewhere else.
So don't put it in the front door; put it somewhere else.
It's a pretty panel of glass.
But then if you put it in the front door, people say, "Oh, you're trying to be like those guys, and you didn't make it."
So don't put it there.
Let's take it out. Throw it away so nobody can use it and put a new one in."
It only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features.
It doesn't even have real prunes. Doesn't even keep you regular.
It's a pretty quick read.
You can snap through it in maybe two years if you read eight hours a day.
They gave it back to the wise old woman.
Now, if you think about that story for a moment, I think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations we get involved in.
It's actually surprisingly simple.
It's not easy, but it's simple.
It's not even new.
It may be one of our most ancient human heritages.
Because if you think about it, normally when we think of conflict, when we describe it, there's always two sides -- it's Arabs versus Israelis, labor versus management, husband versus wife, Republicans versus Democrats.
The path right now is like an acorn; it's still in its early phase.
And that's especially because this world population is increasing, and it's increasing, not only in numbers, but we're also getting wealthier, and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat.
Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins, and at the moment, most of us here get it from livestock, from fish, from game.
In the developed world it's on average 80 kilograms per person per year, which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries, but on average 80 kilograms per person per year.
In the developing world it's much lower.
But it's increasing enormously.
In China in the last 20 years, it increased from 20 to 50, and it's still increasing.
And of course, we are not there to say that's only for us, it's not for them.
So people there are eating them, not because they're hungry, but because they think it's a delicacy.
In fact, a locust is a "shrimp" of the land, and it would make very good into our diet.
It scratches on the soil.
Once the animal knows click, food, click, food, click, food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole, and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed, and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds, which is long for a rat.
It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.
If the animal does that, it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs, by the way.
For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today, 10 calories are taken to produce it.
And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime.
First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy.
It grows and is nurtured.
It's then sold and bought, and it's then delivered to me.
I basically take it, prepare it, and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it.
This bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom -- she didn't like sitting on it, so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale -- reusing, a job that was pretty good.
It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there.
Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.
It serves 220 people a day.
But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it.
All of the soil you can see there is basically my food, which is generated by the restaurant, and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things.
And I tried taking the dried food waste, putting it to the worms, going, "There you go, dinner."
And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos, maybe wash hands with it, I don't know.
And it's run on hydroelectricity, so I've gone from air to water.
Now it's important to understand that this room is cooled by water, heated by water, filters its own water, and it's powered by water.
It literally is Waterhouse.
I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside, pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism, it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof, and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant, cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be.
This takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange.
It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.
And they asked me how was it, and I say to them, "It was good," and I zip my pants up in front of them, and I head for the door.
And this is why I like to talk about this, because if we don't acknowledge it, then the transition will be pretty painful.
But this process is affecting men very differently than it's affecting women.
And I think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don't reverse themselves without a lot of pain, and that's why I talk about us all going through this together.
For one thing, it puts men and women in a really antagonistic relationship with one another, because the men are these devious tricksters up there who've put up this glass ceiling.
And I said, "Well what makes it great?"
It was a website called Nerve.com, the tagline of which was "literate smut."
RG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at, with these beautiful images, and looked at the scene in our actual living room, it looked a little bit more like this.
I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me, tracking it down till the actual due-date.
Average happiness is, of course, inadequate, because it doesn't speak to the moment-by-moment experience, and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience.
But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice, you don't really want to watch it again, because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists.
Now we rationally know that an economy built on hyper-consumption is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards.
Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree, are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere, or someone, where it is.
Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree, are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item and move it from where it's not needed to somewhere, or someone, where it is.
This is where you pay for the benefit of the product -- what it does for you -- without needing to own the product outright.
I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.
It's a new social currency, so to speak, that could become as powerful as our credit rating.
He's focused on this hyena, and he is going to get it.
It used to be the time where only kings wore a leopard skin, but now throughout rituals and ceremonies, traditional healers and ministers.
And of course, looking at this lion paw that has been skinned, it eerily reminds me of a human hand, and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.
We need it. We respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman, as a community and as part of this planet, and we need to continue that.
I don't even have it for myself.
It needs to be rewarding.
It relies too much on transportation, chemical fertilization, big use of water and also refrigeration.
I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.
And I'm more of the, "life's messy, clean it up, organize it and put it into a bento box."
And I'm like, knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A's.
No one wants to talk about it, and the less you talk about it, the more you have it.
I'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out, I'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame, I'm going to understand how vulnerability works, and I'm going to outsmart it.
I kind of understood, this is what shame is, this is how it works.
Courage, the original definition of courage, when it first came into the English language -- it's from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart" -- and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart.
Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks.
Banking wasn't always this way, and it doesn't have to be this way.
But every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran -- that feeling of "I get it now" -- it would slip away overnight, and I'd come back in the morning wondering if I wasn't lost in a strange land, and yet the terrain was very familiar.
That idea only came into being 300 years later, and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps.
And so with this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product, I took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process.
And I've listened to that solo 200 times, and I still like it.
But it was better in one group, and that was women under 50 who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts, and in those women, digital mammography found twice as many cancers, but it still only found 60 percent.
And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors, but it's also very expensive.
If you can find a tumor when it's less than a centimeter, survival exceeds 90 percent, but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases.
And you can see that it looks a lot different.
After the fourth rejection, we requested reconsideration of the manuscript, because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology.
Mammography isn't perfect, but it's the only test that's been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer.
And nobody read it except for my mom.
Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket and go up by 100 percent when she forwarded it to my dad.
And then I got excited when it started getting tens of hits, and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens and then hundreds and then thousands and then millions.
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
And when we did, my dad would say, "Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there, picked this thing off it, put it in a truck, drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the Atlantic Ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,
so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?"
Life is so great that we only get such a short time to experience and enjoy all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.
Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you're carrying around all the time.
But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn't just get adopted because it works.
It gets adopted because people use it and it's made for humans.
It gets adopted because people use it and it's made for humans.
It has its own external prosthetic devices, and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other.
And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore, because, though Ray was a miner there, the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction, because, of course, it can't compete on the scale of operations which are happening in South America, Australia, wherever.
But anyway, I got my suitcase of iron ore and dragged it back to London on the train, and then was faced with the problem: Okay, how do you make this rock into components for a toaster?
I dragged out this stuff, and it wasn't iron.
It's not anymore, but I found a retired geology professor to take me down, and he said, "Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine."
And geologists have actually christened -- well, they're debating whether to christen -- the age that we're living in -- they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the Anthropocene, the age of Man.
And there it is on the shelves.
Bruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once.
It's not developmentally appropriate, and it's particularly bad for boys.
It's still working its way up the food chain.
And by the way, the assumption that we can safely control the Earth's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat, making the planet not too hot, not too cold, but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style -- this is pure fantasy, and it's not coming from the climate scientists.
It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice, because I believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we're on like little else.
You can't just drill a hole and pump it out.
If you get a bubble in your medicine -- because you have to mix it every morning -- and it stays in there, you probably die.
The pump was a little bit problematic when performing, so I'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage.
I had hoped my voice would be saved, but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it.
It's about living.
It's going to destroy the living systems there.
I don't mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff.
So this gigabyte or terabyte of data, we're putting it into this block.
The person was killed by stabs in the heart, but they just deposited the knife by putting it through one of the eyeballs.
He's taken the pen, and he's moving it towards the heart, and he's putting it on the heart, and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient.
The signal is really deep inside of the brain as well, and it's shining through, because all of the data is inside this volume.
It was kind of hard to get it in.
So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length.
It knows how much it's moving.
And so it's going to try to watch your response.
It can also learn from you about the quality of its jokes and cater things, sort of like Netflix-style, over longer-term to different communities or audiences, children versus adults, different cultures.
It's just a robot.
It doesn't have feelings ... yet.
Because it's neither rare nor well done.
Data: I find it incredibly educational.
Actually, as soon as someone turns it on, I go into the other room and read.
It is not. It is also shaped equally by history and culture.
Thirteen years on, the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997.
So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong -- as it will be to the question of Taiwan -- was a natural response: one civilization, many systems.
It's had no serious rivals.
Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder, a stranger, certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained, the Chinese don't see the state like that at all.
I mean, it's leading firms -- many of them are still publicly owned.
It's kind of arrogant.
It's arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best, and therefore we have the universal measure.
And secondly, it's ignorant.
And the second implication is that the world will inevitably, as a consequence, become increasingly unfamiliar to us, because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with, or conversant with.
It travels on rails down a suburban road, and the cars travel underneath it.
And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour.
So it's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information, and it just sounds perfect.
It says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for, so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you.
It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what, but you get the statistics for how effective it is.
It's used to test for prostate cancer, but there are all sorts of reasons why your prostate might be enlarged.
In this case it's about 25 percent, based on that.
We pass it down from generation to generation.
It takes what we know, and it twists it.
It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress, and it makes it unexpected, and that's what elicits a laugh.
And not only that, it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect, but through the heart.
And rather than send it, I decided to read it to them in person.
Then he took my fibula from my calf, cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh, where it now lives.
And what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf and re-vascularized it in my thigh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip.
My home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge, and during the year and a half I was on crutches, it became a sort of symbol to me.
And it's become my own motto for my girls.
One is: why isn't it happening now?
DD: So it goes on to show you people making things out of wood, a grandfather making a ship in a bottle, a woman making a pie -- somewhat standard fare of the day.
You could build your own satellite and get it into space for like 8,000 dollars.
It had been presumed before.
It's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off, but it ain't doing both -- we can.
It is lifeless.
It was alive once, hunted, stolen, stretched.
It preps you. It aims you.
Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within.
If you don't design your life, someone else will design it for you, and you may just not like their idea of balance.
It's totally dominated by work.
And because it's new, Leo doesn't really know what to make of it.
And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach.
It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do.
It could make eye contact with you.
It could share information looking down at a screen.
And then it could help track that for you.
And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue.
It could help you set goals and track your progress, and it would help motivate you.
And when it's in their world, they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen.
And when it's in their world, they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen.
And now it's got number power.
And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it.
When we were working on the Eden Project, we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular, but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried.
It's a high-strength polymer.
And the great thing about this stuff is you can make it in units of roughly seven times the size of glass, and it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing.
They then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding.
When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it.
They put it into worm recomposting systems, which produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon, which produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants.
And I know it's a quirky example, but I think the implications of this are quite radical, because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem -- waste -- into a massive opportunity.
This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle, and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert.
The way it does this is it comes out at night, crawls to the top of a sand dune, and because it's got a matte black shell, is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings.
The way it does this is it comes out at night, crawls to the top of a sand dune, and because it's got a matte black shell, is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings.
So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air, it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth.
So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air, it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth.
And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside.
So after a while, we could take that out, use it as a lightweight building block.
We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts, transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity.
It's about 80 minutes long.
No, no, no. It's four minutes long.
And if it's started, I just point where you whistle along, and we will see what happens.
As essential as it is across our traditions, as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives, the word "compassion" is hollowed out in our culture, and it is suspect in my field of journalism.
It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing, or it's seen as potentially depressing.
Now compassion, when it enters the news, too often comes in the form of feel-good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self-sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time.
In the medical context that it comes from, it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment.
It is organic, across our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions, and yet it transcends them.
Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others, both in our private and in our civic spaces.
So what is it, three-dimensionally?
It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation, but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence.
It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there, just showing up.
I'm not sure if I can show you what tolerance looks like, but I can show you what compassion looks like -- because it is visible.
When we see it, we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable, what is possible.
When we see it, we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable, what is possible.
I can't quite explain it, and he can't either.
Compassion is rarely a solution, but it is always a sign of a deeper reality, of deeper human possibilities.
And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen, who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her, that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces.
And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen, who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her, that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces.
And that the highest human calling is to look for this light, to point at it when we see it, to gather it up, and in so doing, to repair the world.
Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way.
Now invoking Einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us, but actually it is.
Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity.
So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing and say that humanity, the future of humanity, needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race.
No scientists dispute this curve, but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way.
We leave our money for 10 to 15 years, and when we get it back, we invest in other innovations that focus on change.
Because at the height of the season, at the height of its powers, it's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world, it reaches to the heavens."
And he said, "But right before the harvest, it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came."
And as I think about the mesh and I think about, well, what's driving it, how come it's happening now, I think there's a number of vectors that I want to give you as background.
It allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways.
One of the founders went to Switzerland, saw it implemented someplace, said, "Wow, that looks really cool.
They made it sexy. They made it fresh.
They're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services, because the two things that really work for car-sharing is, one, the car has to be available, and two, it's within one or two blocks of where you stand.
People are making anywhere between 200 and 700 dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it.
It's now traveling.
At the moment it's in Indianapolis, but it was at the Smithsonian.
And so we set it up, and we called ourselves the G7.
In Madrid, Maria Gonzalez is standing at the door, listening to her baby crying and crying, trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it.

Our face is hugely important because it's the external, visual part that everybody else sees.
Let's not forget it's a functional entity.
But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone -- our head would be dead weight, we wouldn't be able to hold it erect, we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us.
It's thicker, it's darker, it's coarser, it doesn't have the contours.
This is not a life-saving transplant -- like a heart, or liver, or lung transplant -- it is a quality-of-life transplant, and as a result, are the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on, "I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer"? We don't know yet.
Now science may dismiss this methodology, but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel.
Now science may dismiss this methodology, but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel.
It always was.
It's the most important map of all.
It's like the parts list of your body.
It doesn't say how things are connected, what causes what and so on.
So the list of ingredients does tell you something, and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong.
Well first of all, it's because we can read it, which is fantastic.
It's fundamental to Darwin and Mendel and so on.
You predict a black hole, and you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said.
So this great triumph -- it's so good, there's almost a religious experience in biology.
We might not even know what this protein is, but we can see it's a marker for the response to the disease.
We might divide it -- the plumber would say, "Well, where's the water?"
"Well, it's in the kitchen." "Oh, you must have kitchen water."
That's kind of the level at which it is.
It's by Astor Piazzolla, an Argentine composer.
But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from.
WK: And people actually, after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime, the youth who have organized themselves in certain groups and councils, they are guarding the transformation and they are trying to put it on a track in order to satisfy the values of democracy, but at the same time also to make it reasonable and to make it rational, not to go out of order.
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people.
"It will be as big as your house."
People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it -- some are a bit high for that, I agree -- but the people in the street, they are the curator.
I heard it was one of the most violent favelas, because the largest drug cartel controls it.
Some people question, "Why is it in black and white?
Some who understood the project would explain it to others.
So the people kept it.
This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernobyl originally, and I pasted it in Southern Italy, where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground.
Actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions, and then enables you to change the world.
It is an increasingly difficult picture, even assuming the economy does quite well -- probably better than it will do.
We then place it in an oven-like device, and we're able to create that structure and bring it out.
Once it's scanned, it sends information in the correct layers of cells where they need to be.
And because they used my own cells to build this bladder, it's going to be with me.
The first paradox is that growing up is about rejecting the past and then promptly reclaiming it.
So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's, but it looks very different.
It's about embracing the paradox.
It's about acting in the face of overwhelm.
And it's about loving people really well.
The traditional model, it penalizes you for experimentation and failure, but it does not expect mastery.
The traditional model, it penalizes you for experimentation and failure, but it does not expect mastery.
It'll change what happens at the dinner table.
When you talk about self-paced learning, it makes sense for everyone -- in education-speak, "differentiated learning" -- but it's kind of crazy, what happens when you see it in a classroom.
SK: Yeah, it's ready.
No, no reason why it really can't happen in every classroom in America tomorrow.
It meant a connection to the world.
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society.
And this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see.
And along came the Internet and it swept them out of the way, and it allowed all of us to connect together, and it was awesome.
It wasn't perfect, but it got us through the last century.
Because I think we really need the Internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being.
We need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives.
And now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the context he saw it in, and we use it to penetrate through the video and find every activity trace that co-occurred with an instance of water.
It basically said, everybody near the stream can share in the stream.
In some states, senior water rights holders can leave their water in-stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right.
After all, it is their water right, and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream, it's their right to do so.
It's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it's critically needed, into these degraded ecosystems, while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used.
You see these cars that drive up -- usually it's Saabs and Audis and Volvos, because in certain neighborhoods it's socially acceptable to have a luxury car, so long as it comes from a country hostile to U.S. foreign policy -- that's fine.
It's really hard to imagine a sofa, how it's going to look in your house.
And the way you should do that is study the furniture, let it marinate in your mind, distract yourself, and then a few days later, go with your gut, because unconsciously you've figured it out.
It gives us a deeper sense of what it actually takes for us to thrive in this life.
And the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the IQ of the group; it's determined by how well they communicate, how often they take turns in conversation.
But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe.
Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space.
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth.
And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.
But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.
The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.
But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.
We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.
Then it's gone.
whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity -- we'll build them, we'll turn on the machines and, bang, we'll catch it -- the first song from space.
It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land, highlighting it compared to the dim environment.
It is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other.
But when you look at this planet at night, it looks like this.
It never reaches the ground where it was meant for.
It only spoils the darkness.
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity, because this tiny, tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it.
And we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness.
And we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness.
And then when you add the lens to that, you can bundle the light and send it wherever you need it without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else.
I think, when I see it, I start to think, who are those people?
And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light.
And she's going to learn that this life will hit you hard in the face, wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach.
But that's what the rain boots are for, because rain will wash away everything, if you let it.
It can crumble so easily, but don't be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.
It can crumble so easily, but don't be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.
And it was here, listening to these poets share their stories, that I learned that spoken-word poetry didn't have to be indignant, it could be fun or painful or serious or silly.
But I teach spoken-word poetry because it's accessible.
It allows for even more opportunities for them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to.
My mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine, and the first day it was going to be used, even Grandma was invited to see the machine.
The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards.
The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon, using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat, to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed.
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision on whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish -- it'll be sold in the stores.
And now, using a joystick, they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right, forwards or backwards.
And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed that this creature -- this is a moth -- this is the moth in its pupa stage, and that's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology, so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth, it is already prewired.
The wires are already in its body, and they can just hook it up to their technology, and now they've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance.
It is living -- fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides, attached photosensitive sensors to the brain, put it into a cart -- here's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle -- and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart, when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart, the cart moves toward the light;

when you turn it off, it moves away.
Finally, not that long ago, Craig Venter created the first artificial cell, where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer, which is a machine, created an artificial genome, put it in a different cell -- the genome was not of the cell he put it in -- and that cell then reproduced as the other cell.
I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund, the body of a retriever, maybe some pink fur, and let's make it glow in the dark"?
It's called "Aria."
It was written for an amazing singer called Cathy Berberian.
You choose in your own tempo in your own way to follow the line, but you must respect it, more or less.
It's quite spontaneous.
People who have no light, whether it's physical or metaphorical, cannot pass our exams, and we can never know what they know.
Use it to spread great ideas.
Okay, we'll do something with it.
The hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called "Faustus in Africa," a Handspring Production from 1995, where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy.
AK: Well actually I prefer to say that it's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life.
AK: It has ears that move passively when the head goes.
It was just called "Tall Horse," which was a life-sized giraffe.
BJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider.
AK: It had to have a rider, and it had to participate in cavalry charges.
And we had a crate built for it.
We opened the lid, we took the horse out, and it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden.
We opened the lid, we took the horse out, and it did work; it walked and it was able to be ridden.
Adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that -- because that's how a horse would breathe, with an expanded chest.
I'll stop it there in the interest of time.
I actually was moved to tears when I first saw it.
Beau Awtin: ♫ Safe in bed ♫ EW: And our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal -- there was an MTV video where they all sang "Lollipop" and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody.
And it's a tremendous honor for me to be able to show it to you here first.
If I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor, put some play-dough on it, stick it on and we have spinning.
But typically you do; typically it opens.
And then as you get close, you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line, so that it's not on you when you land, and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall.
I went down to be with a Ranger platoon on an operation in Afghanistan, and on that operation, a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a Taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team.
Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful.
It's probably more powerful than marriage vows.
And they've lived up to it, which gives it special power.
But if compassion was fun, everybody's going to do it.
It's sort of a funny pattern.
It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something.
So in other words, it almost always starts from the bottom up.
The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders.
The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce.
It's such a small thing, right?
And now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see.

But as you look at it, I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy.
The universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom.
It's incredibly hot.
It contains everything that's in today's universe, so you can imagine, it's busting.
And it's expanding at incredible speed.
And energy does something else quite magical: it congeals to form matter -- quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons.
We know above all that it was extremely simple.
It consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms, and they have no structure.
If, like me, you're wearing a gold ring, it was forged in a supernova explosion.
So, it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean.
We've seen that DNA learns in a sense, it accumulates information.
So what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us, but it can also show us our power with collective learning.
I want my grandson, Daniel, and his friends and his generation, throughout the world, to know the story of big history, and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us.
So they tell you where it is, what the prices are, the address, the phone number, etc.
It talks about the candidates -- written very well -- but no information, no follow-up, no websites for the campaigns, no information about when the debates are, where the campaign offices are.
As long as we're teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead, or someone tells you that you're part of a prophecy, they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership, which is that it comes from within.
Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?"
Indeed, it's rather small.
He decided to tell it to me and I made a book, from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later.
I want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself, and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away.
When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air.
It still needs improvement, but at least it sounds like me and not like HAL 9000.
I plan to use it on television, radio and the Internet.
I bought a tractor -- then it broke.
I paid to get it repaired -- then it broke again.
So I imagine my life: if a hundred years ago China had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the United States in search of coal, and they found it, and, in fact, they found lots of it right here.
Okay, try this. Bring it back.
And when that doesn't work, when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart, then we move on to a third assumption: they know the truth, and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes.
The miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is.
It's that you can see the world as it isn't.
It's that you can see the world as it isn't.
And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table, I began to call it the wisdom table.
And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office, and it reminds me of him.
And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office, and it reminds me of him.
It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes."
And I'd like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table, really.
Now it's still in debt, but Chris has managed, through his own sacrifice, to get this film out.
I didn't use that stare very often, but I do have it in my repertoire.
And so we made the game, and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure.
And it has four Plexiglass layers.
I offer them the job, they can turn it down, and then they choose their own cabinet.
It'll be more realer if she reads it."
A few years after that, in Bangalore, I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night, and I picked up this book, thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes.
And as it happened, I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot.
That feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career -- from being a software engineer to become a science writer -- so that I could partake in the joy of science, and also the joy of communicating it to others.
And I first begin with a pie chart -- and I promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation -- but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos.
When a neutrino hits a water molecule it emits a kind of blue light, a flash of blue light, and by looking for this blue light, you can essentially understand something about the neutrino and then, indirectly, something about the dark matter that might have created this neutrino.
They have to drill holes in the ice, dive down into the water -- cold, cold water -- to get hold of the instrument, bring it up, do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do, put it back and get out before the ice melts.
And I don't know if you can read the lettering, but it says, "Ivan the Terribus."
And this particular balloon, because it has to launch two tons of weight, is an extremely huge balloon.
In order to minimize the weight, it's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper.
And if they have to pack it back, they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again -- except, when they did it first, it would have been done in Texas.
And if they have to pack it back, they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again -- except, when they did it first, it would have been done in Texas.
We make them every day -- last night in my hotel room, when I decided to double-lock the door, or you in your car when you drove here, when we go eat lunch and decide the food's not poison and we'll eat it.
Security theater's exposed when it's obvious that it's not working properly.
It's, of course, limited by science, by technology.
It's limited by our cognitive biases.
It hasn't changed as we were growing up.
So as your model is close to reality, and it converges with feelings, you often don't know it's there.
Now it had a name, which made it scarier than the regular flu, even though it was more deadly.
And those two things made the risk more than it was.
And when the vaccine appeared last winter, there were a lot of people -- a surprising number -- who refused to get it -- as a nice example of how people's feelings of security change, how their model changes, sort of wildly with no new information, with no new input.
In the history of the past 50 years, the smoking risk shows how a model changes, and it also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn't like.
So it's a very hard model to accept.
Remember I said feeling, model, reality; I said reality doesn't change. It actually does.
It's a horrific story. Someone took a bottle of Tylenol, put poison in it, closed it up, put it back on the shelf.
Or, what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time, and do so in an environmentally friendly way?
The abalone shell here -- and if you fracture it, you can look at the fact that it's nano-structured.
The abalone shell here -- and if you fracture it, you can look at the fact that it's nano-structured.
It has the chemical sequences of amino acids, which says, "This is how to build the structure.
I brought it here.
You can see it in this case -- that's lighting this LED.
And if we wanted to zoom into a page, we can just open it up.
Zoom into it and see where it was taken.
It's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles -- an acute angle, a right angle, an obtuse angle, a straight angle.
If you look at the hexagon, for instance, it's like an amoeba, which is constantly changing its own profile.
You give it a push, this becomes a parallelogram.
Look at the pentagon, for instance, pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium.
Push it and it becomes house shaped.
Push it and it becomes house shaped.
Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus.
It becomes kite-shaped.
Because if they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash.
And we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it.
Teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years, they just muck up the definition and they spit it out.
The other is that you keep blowing at it, keep making the sound, and you keep cutting it.
That night, when the passengers would be sleeping, he would give it one more fold, and the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap -- with a little shoot just like a designer cap, because it protects the spinal cord.
And the second night, he would take the same cap and give it another fold.
And the third night, he would give it two more folds -- and this is a very, very famous cap.
This swallows the bridge and knocks it down.
And it is.
And as it evaporates, it will knit itself together, forming seams.
Align it in this direction.
Make it hydrophobic.
And while you're at it, just form it around this 3D shape."
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it.
There is something that made it that way.
And it's basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice, so that macroscopically it looks the same.
We learned that it's accelerating.
If you look at the galaxy, it's moving away.
If you come back a billion years later and look at it again, it will be moving away faster.
It is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other.
Space may be finite or infinite, but because the universe is accelerating, there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see.
In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking told us that a black hole, even though you think it's black, it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics.
It will probably increase, and the probability is enormously huge.
The good news is that, therefore, this scenario does not work; it is not right.
If our order were due to a fluctuation, we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it.
It's cooling off.
That's because an egg is not a closed system; it comes out of a chicken.
But we've been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like, why it came to be in the way it did for many, many years.
It reminds us that we are a part of nature, and we're not separate from it.
It reminds us that we are a part of nature, and we're not separate from it.
It's like the canary in the coalmine.
It reminds us that we are a part of nature and we need to take care of it.
And I knew someday that I was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it.
And after two months of sitting there -- one day, thinking that it was all over, this incredible big white male came down, right beside me, three feet away from me, and he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it.
We're inundated with news all the time that the sea ice is disappearing and it's at its lowest level.
It acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden.
It could have survived 150 years of whaling.
It just sees this big balloon in the ocean -- it doesn't have hands -- it's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go.
And this seal is taking this penguin by the head, and it's flipping it back and forth.
And what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out, so it can eat the meat off the bones, and then it goes off and gets another one.
She chased that big seal away, went and got its penguin and brought it to me.
So it's kind of different from what we're used to thinking about silk.
The silk worm does a remarkable thing: it uses these two ingredients, protein and water, that are in its gland, to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection -- so comparable to technical fibers like Kevlar.
So the recipe is simple: you take the silk solution, you pour it, and you wait for the protein to self-assemble.
It means that you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology, like microelectronics and nanoscale technology.
And much like in the DVD, you can read it out optically.
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted.
Because smiling is evolutionarily contagious, and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles.
It was due to a Russian mathematical physicist, and it was a complicated theory.
The implication of that is that the wave function has to go to zero, it has to vanish when the helium atoms touch each other.
It was so simple, in fact, that I suspect a really smart high school student, who didn't even have calculus, could understand what he wrote down.
The electron hits it suddenly.
And it senses light with a little eye-spot, which works not unlike how our eye works.
When blue light hits it, it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot, and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery.
The shock isn't painful, but it's a little annoying.
So what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear.
And if the bus is going to stop and it's three yards away from the bus stop, you're just a prisoner.
So it's got hybrid drive.
And as he was diving, someone had stamped on his knee, and it had broken like this.
It was voted the worst place in Britain to live.
It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top.
And it's a power park.
But the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape, rather than engulf it.
And so the daylight was just coming -- it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed.
Because it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway, but if you say you're going to drill 66,000 holes in it -- we had quite a time.
It persists for months and oftentimes for years, and when that happens, it is its own disease.
Now, I want you to imagine that I'm stroking it with this.
Wrap it in an ACE bandage, take some ibuprofen for a week or two, and that's the end of the story.
It was cadaverically cold to the touch.
It changes, and it morphs in response to stimuli.
I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs.
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution.
Well, it uses it to defend itself from its predators.
It's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm, and just like the alarm on your car or your house, it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder, thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away.
It's got a light organ under its eye.
It's got a lot of other light organs you can't see, but you'll see in here in a minute.
Now it may look like a tasty morsel, or a pig's head with wings --  but if it's attacked, it puts out a barrage of light -- in fact, a barrage of photon torpedoes.
They use it for finding food, for attracting mates, for defending against predators.
And like the one you just saw, it can produce these as bands of light.
But if it had been following the odor plume, it would have come in from the other direction.
It will come untied less often.
It will let you down less, and not only that, it looks better.
And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers, but we also open sourced it, and we made it released as a Google Code project, where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it.
Collaborator Six: Watching the video in my room, I could see me not understanding at the beginning of it.
So this isn't finished at all, but it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate.
And if you find one that you're interested in, you can actually click on it and open up an information panel where you're able to rate that frame, which helps it bubble up to the top.
It's an online music video for the Arcade Fire.
And you type in the address -- it actually creates a music video specifically for you, pulling in Google maps and Streetview images into the experience itself.
We can take it completely for granted.
It can't live for a very long time in people.
It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all.
It's been tried six times in the last century, and it's been successful exactly once.
But smallpox eradication was hard; it was very, very hard.
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it's exposed to too much heat, and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it's not potent; it's not going to protect them.
So you could get around the disease; you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off.
It's been working to help control pandemic flu, SARS for example.
It's also tried to save children by doing other things -- giving vitamin A drops, giving measles shots, giving bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns.
And then, in one of the most important, tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world, we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have.
In conditions like this, the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to.
And so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago, when people were saying, "We should call it off," the Polio Partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions, new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again.
Well, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production.
And it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world.
Sanitation is terrible, and our old vaccine, you remember, worked half as well as it should have.
It sounds like a lot of money; it is a lot of money.
It's a magical realist novel.
My obsession with this book, and the reason I made this into a film, is because it at once was addressing the question of being a female -- traditionally, historically in Iran -- and the question of four women who are all looking for an idea of change, freedom and democracy -- while the country of Iran, equally, as if another character, also struggled for an idea of freedom and democracy
I made this film because I felt it's important for it to speak to the Westerners about our history as a country.
It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians who stand for basic human rights and struggle for democracy.
Maybe it's a problem of the political culture, and we have to think about how to change that political culture."
That trend is generally called Islamic modernism, and it was advanced by intellectuals and statesmen, not just as an intellectual idea though, but also as a political program.
We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?
But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment, in a flat, closed-off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones.
So it measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like a human ear, inner ear.
Now let's see if Mark avoids it.
But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle, and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle.
It's a book on culture, and, as you can see, culture is rapidly drifting around.
And I've found that it influenced my life and work in a very intriguing way.
If you don't think that way, well, you have a lot of company in the history of Western philosophy, because the tidy idea, you know, people criticized it.
Not just because it rang earlier, but I'm going to take it because I made a little calculation.
Not just because it rang earlier, but I'm going to take it because I made a little calculation.
You can't just take human thinking and put it into a machine.
It's based on Norse legend.
If you want to make a dinosaur, you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap -- otherwise known as amber -- that has some blood-sucking insects in it, good ones, and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA, because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out.
It wasn't a very complete T. rex, and it wasn't a very big T. rex, but it was a very special B-rex.
And I and my colleagues cut into it, and we were able to determine, by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it, that B-rex had died at the age of 16.
She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.
But we thought maybe -- well, we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.
I mean, it was wonderful stuff.
But it's not dinosaur DNA.
I mean it really is.
That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.
You take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish, and, puff, they glow.
It has the three fingers, the three digits.
And so we know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail.
But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.
So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken, modify it and make the chickenosaurus.
It's a cooler-looking chicken.
Anyway -- When our dino-chicken hatches, it will be, obviously, the poster child, or what you might call a poster chick, for technology, entertainment and design.
Today, I'm using it to create permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world.
Now it had a sense of place.
It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates, sped up the planet's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day.
The sculpture could now be entirely soft, which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings -- literally becoming part of the fabric of the city.
He had just signed the contract to sell his New York apartment at a six-figure profit, and he'd only owned it for five years.
And just like we have the OnStar system in cars, your red light might go on -- it won't say "check engine" though.
It's going to be "check your body" light, and go in and get it taken care of.
It can take pictures of your GI system, help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract.
It should be on the market within a year or two.
It seems to shrink, but it often comes back.
And we devalue it in three areas.
And here's how it works.
It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system that has little changed for 100 years, that values rote learning, memorization and standardization, and devalues self-expression, self-exploration, questioning, creativity and play.
And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech -- that play is the catalyst, it is the revolution, that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better.
It increases our openness to change.
It improves our ability to learn.
Two, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant.
Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy, that you enjoyed only six months ago, but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy, because you feel like you have to be serious, rediscover it.
It's when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain, you meet your friends, you have a beer, you have some food, you talk, you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you wouldn't have had before.
to MAKE the future rather than wait for it.
Space, we all know what it looks like.
Radio astronomers study radio waves from space using sensitive antennas and receivers, which give them precise information about what an astronomical object is and where it is in our night sky.
But the medium is lossy -- it's subject to a lot of noise and interference.
It was in the microwave range, and it appeared to be coming from all directions simultaneously.
Now this didn't make any sense, and like any reasonable engineer or scientist, they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself, it must be the dish.
Corruption? Poverty? Or is it something else?
It's like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it's the flu and it will just go away.
They sent a message to the kidnappers: "If you want your ransom come and get it.
The battle is won, but we still have to fight it.
So we could deliberately erase some symbols, and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols.
When this result was first published, it was highly controversial.
It shows that the Indus script shares an important property of language.
This sign is the most frequently-occurring sign in the Indus script, and it's only in this text that it occurs as a doubling pair.
If it does represent language, then how do we read the symbols?
The Indus civilization does not belong to just the South Indians or the North Indians or the Pakistanis; it belongs to all of us.
Now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it.
Here it is.
These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.
And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like.
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.
And when the insect gets there and lands on it, dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant, if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture, you can see that there are actually some patterning there, which is three-dimensional.
Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that.
It's so unpredictable and so fragile.
Because it's the first thing we draw; we surround ourselves with images of it; it's probably the most common image on the planet.
Until it was stripped from me, I never thought about it.
I felt empty and full, hot and cold, euphoric and depressed because the brain is the world's first fully functional quantum computer; it can occupy multiple states at the same time.
It requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension, but in two dimensions I think you can see the beautiful symmetry and illumination of a normal mind at work.
This is it being held in the hand.
It weighs less than a gram.
Where does it go inside the body?
It has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free for over 80 years.
So it goes in and it stays there.
The concept that they're working towards -- and they have working prototypes -- is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body where they're needed.
And if I do this, probably the mic won't hear it.
When I press it again, it'll chirp three times, and that'll mean that it's armed and ready to go.
When I press it again, it'll chirp three times, and that'll mean that it's armed and ready to go.
This thing blinks all the time; I'll leave it out, so you might be able to see it.
But this is blinking all the time. It's sending signals in real time.
And if you walk faster, if I walk faster, it detects what's called the time interval, which is the interval between each heel lift.
And it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation.
It works.
Because the first generation is exoskeletal, it's wrapped around the leg, around the affected limb.
The American political cartoonist Mark Fiore also had his satire application censored in the United States because some of Apple's staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.
Of course, it's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the Internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is.
I call it the era of citizenship -- where people could be from multi-racial, multi-ethnic backgrounds, but all be equal as citizens in a state.
So as I said, we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it.
It's comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders.
So when Arab socialism started in Egypt, it spread across the region.
I see it in our business leaders.
I see it in the politicians we vote for -- people who, in the face of an incredibly complicated world, are nevertheless absolutely convinced that they understand the way that the world works.
But a typical Hans Rosling graph: think for a moment, not what it shows, but think instead about what it leaves out.
So it'll show you GDP per capita, population, longevity, that's about it.
Now you won't be able to understand a word of it, but this is what it looks like.
It looks a bit like a chess piece -- functions absolutely brilliantly.
We have no idea why it works, no idea at all.
How did it become the world's greatest economy?
Archie lets it die down.
It turned out to be absolutely instrumental many decades later in proving Fermat's Last Theorem.
In fact, it turns out it's equivalent to proving Fermat's Last Theorem.
This picture shows a revolution started by women, and it shows women and men leading a mixed protest.
Think about everything it has brought us.
And it's happening during our lifetimes.
That's why we call it the Internet.
And that code has been encrypted, so let's decrypt it.
It has been encrypted with XOR function 97.
And we can go here and actually start decrypting it.
But just keep staring at it.
It's not used for anything.
For example, you can find it from some phone numbers and car license plates and stuff like that.
And how many times would my self have to die before I realized that it was never alive in the first place?
But it's not. It's a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death.
The self's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it's connected to its creator -- to you and to me.
And when I'm acting a role, I inhabit another self, and I give it life for awhile, because when the self is suspended so is divisiveness and judgment.
I stopped giving it so much authority.
I give it its due.
I take it to therapy.
It's more a reality than the ones our selves have created.
But it's also a fiction. There's a lot of work that went into it after that.
It's not just going to disappear.
But if you can take this big, massive thing, and you could turn it into a million little things -- something like a flock of birds -- well then the radar that's looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky.
And you see this behavior on Amazon as surely as you see it on Wall Street.
But the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don't really quite have it down, it doesn't take away from the effects Pragmatic Chaos has.
And of course, it is, but it's distributed from places.
In New York, this is where it's distributed from: the Carrier Hotel located on Hudson Street.
So therefore, it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion, from 30 percent up to 80 percent.
Only if you control and regulate it, you will get that aerodynamic efficiency.
You could drop an atom bomb on a city, and 30 years later it's surviving. Very few cities fail.
So the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life, is that it is scalable, it works over an extraordinary range.
The same principles, the same dynamics, the same organization is at work in all of these, including us, and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size.
It's three-quarters, roughly, which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear.
Here it is, which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita, unlike biology -- higher wages, more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger, more patents per capita, more crime per capita.
I painted it myself; I'm a forger."
It looked the same, but it had a different origin, it was a different artwork.
In particular, "The Supper at Emmaus" which was viewed as Vermeer's finest masterpiece, his best work -- people would come [from] all over the world to see it -- was actually a forgery.
And when that was discovered, it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum.
It's very simple: pour it from an expensive bottle.
There are now dozens, perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff, it tastes better to you.
It's not just that you say it's more pleasurable, you say you like it more, you really experience it in a different way.
It's not just that you say it's more pleasurable, you say you like it more, you really experience it in a different way.
After she got it, "She was happy to report that she has discovered that he possessed a double who was rich, virile, handsome and aristocratic."
So for instance, we told some people, "Look, you can buy the sweater, but you can't tell anybody you own it, and you can't resell it."
But what really causes an effect is you tell people, "Look, you could resell it, you could boast about it, but before it gets to you, it's thoroughly washed."
But what really causes an effect is you tell people, "Look, you could resell it, you could boast about it, but before it gets to you, it's thoroughly washed."
Some are driven by compassion, feel it's perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity.
It is transforming the face of hunger in Brazil, and it's at scale, and it's creating opportunities.
If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes, you would literally cease to hear it.
Now sound is my passion, it's my life.
Why is it not taught? It's crazy.
And if we can teach listening in our schools, we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous, scary world that I talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time -- or at least capable of doing it.
We use it everyday. We use it in our everyday lives now -- in our private lives, in our business lives.
And it's this importance why I decided to look into the issues that this technology has, because it's so fundamental to our lives.
And in fact, it has created us, has created life, has created all the stuff of life.
So it's inherently safe to use.
Not only that, I compared [it to] the entire spectrum.
And it has a very nice acute property.
Its intensity can be modulated at very high speeds, and it can be switched off at very high speeds.
Put your book beneath it and you can read.
It's illuminating the space.
And if you look at the light, it is illuminating as you would expect.
It's serving the purpose of illumination, but at the same time, we are able to transmit this data.
It can ignore that constant light, because all the receiver's interested in are subtle changes.
But, you can dim down the light to a level that it appears to be off.
It has a flashlight, an LED flashlight.
I'm talking about your language, of course, because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else's mind, and they can attempt to do the same to you, without either of you having to perform surgery.
And just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that, merely by uttering a sound, it can get objects to move across a room and maybe even into its mouth.
Now God, angered at this attempt to usurp his power, destroyed the tower, and then to ensure that it would never be rebuilt, he scattered the people by giving them different languages -- confused them by giving them different languages.
If I can watch which lure you use to catch a fish, or I can watch how you flake your hand axe to make it better, or if I follow you secretly to your mushroom patch, I can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills, and maybe even catch that fish before you do.
In fact, it's a map of Facebook friendship links.
Our modern world is communicating with itself and with each other more than it has at any time in its past.
And it's the dilemma that this Chinese man faces, who's language is spoken by more people in the world than any other single language, and yet he is sitting at his blackboard, converting Chinese phrases into English language phrases.
My car has an engine, but it's not a Ferrari.
It has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth, our spit.
I would drive it and demand things from it.
I would drive it and demand things from it.
It had no limits. It was invincible.
It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself.
I didn't heed it; no, I organized it and I directed it.
I didn't have patience for my body; I snapped it into shape.
In the middle of my traveling, I turned 40 and I began to hate my body, which was actually progress, because at least my body existed enough to hate it.
It was proof that I had not measured up, that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape.
My stomach was proof that I had failed, that it had failed me, that it was broken.
My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it.
My body had not only become a driven machine, but it was responsible now for destroying other women's bodies in its mad quest to make more machines to support the speed and efficiency of my machine.
And gratefully, it didn't.
It was the honey in the water that made it sweet, it was the oil that made it sick.
When you clean a penguin, you first have to spray it with a degreaser.
And they'd been using it at SANCCOB with great success, so they began using it during the Treasure rescue.
And if I took that journey, no matter whether it failed or succeeded, it would be completely irrelevant.
It poisoned his blood. He died when I was 11.
It's been created; nobody knows.
I was showing the film, and I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film -- that it's just a day of peace, it doesn't mean anything.
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back.
We put it into Dari and Pashto. We put it in the local dialects.
They were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it, etc., etc. -- and they made it real.
Obviously it was shown, and it was amazing.
And it's in the six official languages of the United Nations.
And there's a wonderful man sitting in this audience, and I don't know where he is, who said to me a few days ago -- because I did a little rehearsal -- and he said, "I've been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with 365 squares, and one of them is white."
This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at, where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars, all at once, every half hour, and very precisely.
For one thing, we can determine that there's a planet there, but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star.
That distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet receives overall.
So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable, whether it might be amenable to life, we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is, but we want to know about its space weather -- this high-energy radiation, the UV and the X-rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation.

But really, every measurement it makes is precious, because it's teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets, and how it's really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe.
And when you give yourself over to that deception, it becomes magic.
"We have lasers; we can whiten it out."
So this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the DNA, how you convert it to a form you can sequence.
And you can begin to compare it to the genomes of people who live today.
And it was well enough preserved so we could determine the DNA from this individual, even to a greater extent than for the Neanderthals actually, and start relating it to the Neanderthal genome and to people today.
Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that, checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor.
Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that, checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor.
So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems.
So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system.
So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.
You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.
So when you shake the chain, it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in -- so in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.
It is that ability to really stand strong and to recognize also that I'm not separate from this suffering.
Many of us think that compassion drains us, but I promise you it is something that truly enlivens us.
Another thing about compassion is that it really enhances what's called neural integration.
It hooks up all parts of the brain.
Women have manifested for thousands of years the strength arising from compassion in an unfiltered, unmediated way in perceiving suffering as it is.
So the 20th century, then, saw how much more complex reality was, but it also saw a positive side.
It saw that invention could actually benefit from emergencies.
It could benefit from tragedies.
And evolution, although it was established well over 100 years ago by Charles Darwin and a vast number of other people, evolution still is a little bit intangible.
This is a dead crystal, and I'm going to do something to it, and it's going to become alive.
Synthetic biologists are manipulating it.
Well it divides, it competes, it survives.
Well, I like think of it as a flame in a bottle.
And so we have to understand that if we're going to make artificial life or understand the origin of life, we need to power it somehow.
So before we can really start to make life, we have to really think about where it came from.
So the whole area's been stuck for a while, and it got reignited in the '80s when analytical technologies and computer technologies were coming on.
So you imagine, if we're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form, not only will this tell us about the origin of life -- that it's possible that the universe doesn't need carbon to be alive; it can use anything -- we can then take [it] one step further and develop new technologies, because we can then use software control for evolution to code in.
We want to put it out in the environment, and we want it to be powered by the Sun.
We want to put it out in the environment, and we want it to be powered by the Sun.
What we do is we evolve it in a box with a light on.
Biology doesn't care about the design unless it works.
It's a children's book for the iPad.
It's a little quirky and silly.
It's called "Pop-It," And it's about the things little kids do with their parents.
So the East Asian model has this massive selection bias -- it is known as selecting on a dependent variable, something we always tell our students to avoid.
And I called it the Muttering Hat, because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you, but you could detach them and share them with somebody else.
And how are they transformed by wearing it?
And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards.
And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange, but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered.
So when a plant is thirsty, it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like Twitter.
And once again, it's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug.
So it's really quite big.
And perhaps because of its size, a group of people -- all, by the way, with Y chromosomes -- decided they would want to sequence it.
And it looks really good.
But a lot of people don't love it so much.
They call it stupid, and worse, believe me.
My mother, growing up, she called it the "idiot box."
It can make me feel this?
It can change us?
Not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly, but in almost every other respect, it's a huge divergence.
Now when Google digitizes a book, they put it into a really nice format.
We have information about things like where was it published, who was the author, when was it published.
People realized that 1950 was going to happen, and it could be big.
It's the application of massive-scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture.
The Tasmanian devil has shown us that, not only can cancer be a contagious disease, but it can also threaten an entire species with extinction.
The Tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes.
The Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger, and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.
It evolves.
When the devil bites another devil, it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil, so the tumor continues to grow.
It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it.
It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it.
It spreads through the population, has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system, and it's the only cancer that we know of that's threatening an entire species with extinction.
But this dog cancer is quite remarkable, because it spread all around the world.
In fact, genetic profiling tells that it may be tens of thousands of years old, which means that this cancer may have first arisen from the cells of a wolf that lived alongside the Neanderthals.
It's the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of.
It's a living relic of the distant past.
The incredible contribution of the doodle is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously with the possibility of an emotional experience.
In reality, it is one of its greatest allies.
Later he renamed it the stethoscope.
And then the next day, I would come, and I would do it again.
And it might just be coming to a neighborhood near you soon.
It was a dimly lit shack.
But maybe it was time to prove to myself, yes, it's important to understand the past, it is important to look at it in a different light, but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture and build on those foundations in the present.
So when the echo of the gunshots had lingered, it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob, and I didn't believe what I was hearing.
We in the West, we preach the values, the golden light of democracy, that we are the shining example of how it's done.
Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa is not over, but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists, and that we must not take it for granted.
But we're also unimpressed by authority, because it's so easy to contrive.
It's very straightforward -- you take a bunch of people, you split them in half, you treat one group one way, you treat the other group the other way, and a little while later, you follow them up and see what happened to each of them.
Either you've rigged it by design, or you've got enough data so there's no need to randomize people anymore.
And you can get license to bring your drug to market with only data showing that it's better than nothing, which is useless for a doctor like me trying to make a decision.
And it's a foregone conclusion, if you give a drug at that high a dose, that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better.
We need to have all of the data on a particular treatment to know whether or not it really is effective.
♫ in the middle of the night ♫ ♫ and everybody listens to my song, ♫ ♫ then it is plain to see. ♫ ♫ My lips, they give so fiery a kiss, ♫ ♫ my limbs, they are supple and soft. ♫ ♫ It is written for me in the stars, ♫ ♫ thou shalt kiss, thou shalt love. ♫ ♫ My feet, they glide and float, ♫ ♫ my eyes, they lure and glow. ♫
Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values, but also, it's about the environment.
So it's actually life, but it's actually not as we thought life would be.
So it's actually life, but it's actually not as we thought life would be.
It's actually not life, it's a crystal.
And it started out quite a while ago when someone wrote one of the first successful computer viruses.
And he designed this system, but it really didn't work, because his viruses were constantly destroying each other.
And then you see sort of like a stasis coming on where the system essentially waits for a new type of innovation, like this one, which is going to spread over all the other innovations that were before and is erasing the genes that it had before, until a new type of higher level of complexity has been achieved.
But suppose you take some dirt and dig through it and then put it into these spectrometers, because there's bacteria all over the place; or you take water anywhere on Earth, because it's teaming with life, and you make the same analysis; the spectrum looks completely different.
Granted, it's limited, but we have learned what it takes in order to actually construct it.
Now we don't know that there's life then, but we could say, "Well at least I'm going to have to take a look very precisely at this chemical and see where it comes from."
And that might be our chance of actually discovering life when we cannot visibly see it.
Life can be less mysterious than we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other planets.
Look at the coffee table -- it grows in height and width to seat 10.
It certainly doesn't cost as much as oil, and it's plentiful, as I hope that you've been able to see from the photographs.
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos.
We push that material to extruders where we melt it, push it through small die holes, make spaghetti-like plastic strands.
But I'm happy to say now that the world has moved on, music has moved on with it.
And the bigger your gesture gets, the more ill-defined, blurry and, frankly, useless it is to the orchestra.
If you hold it too tightly, you crush it.
If you hold it too tightly, you crush it.
If you hold it too loosely, it flies away."
If you hold it too loosely, it flies away."
It's called "U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha" -- literally "Carmen of Khayelitsha."
Something which I find utterly enchanting about South African music making is that it's so free.
Oh my goodness me, there it was loud and clear, surely.
Well an idea is that that strategy, that learning strategy, is an extremely powerful, great strategy for getting on in the world, but it has one big disadvantage.
Whereas, if you do the likely thing, put the block on the detector, it will only activate two out of six times.
He told the experimenter to do this, to try putting it out onto the other location.
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts, it expands, so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking, talking, faculty meeting-attending zombie back home.
And as I took on my career as a designer, I began to ask myself the simple question: Do we actually think beauty, or do we feel it?
Then I found out, that this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddle or a stream filled with coliforms and all sorts of disgusting stuff, that that filthy water will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis and end up inside it as pure, potable drinking water.
Look at that. What are you feeling about it?
Well it obviously isn't.
I'm not getting it off the eyebrow.
But I also know why it's exquisite to me, because it's a palimpsest of things.
It's masses and masses of layers.
It's something much bigger.
Now that thing, light flickers across it as you move, so it becomes a kinetic object, even though it's standing still -- managed by how brilliantly that's done on the reflection.
And because your brain starter motor began there, now it's got to deal with it.
And the great thing is, this motorcycle has been styled this way specifically to engender a sense that it's green technology and it's good for you and it's light and it's all part of the future.
Well in this case it isn't, because it's a very, very ecologically-sound piece of technology.
You may see 50, 100, 200 things on a shelf as you walk down it, but I have to work within that domain, to ensure that it gets you there first.
It informs, it tells us, it supplies us answers before we've even thought about it.
With one item in its thought, it snaps instantly to the next item.
And so he suggested a machine, and he called it the memex.
And he was so inspired by this article, it kind of directed the rest of his life.
We called it hml: hypertext markup language.
We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives.
We're against lying, but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries.
It's as old as breathing.
It's part of our culture, it's part of our history.
Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive.
Ask a deceptive person to tell their story, they're going to pepper it with way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places.
And in the presence of contempt, whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn't always follow -- look the other way, go the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, "No thank you. I'm not coming up for just one more nightcap. Thank you."
It's transparent with blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live their lives in public.
And in a traditional American funeral, a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive.
It's then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition -- a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel.
So when I die, the Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it.
It's covered with a crocheted netting that is embedded with mushroom spores.
So it's the only college in India where, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's, you are disqualified to come.
Wouldn't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in?
Wouldn't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in?
One of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material, carbon, that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor, and when the vaporized carbon condenses, it condenses back into a different form: chickenwire rolled up.
It was in actually a diner outside of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.
EBox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside, hold it until you need it, and then be able to release it and pass it off.
EBox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside, hold it until you need it, and then be able to release it and pass it off.
And if I don't need it, I can convert it back up on the window to energy, light, and beam it, line of site, to your place.
But in a world where energy is freed and transmittable easily and cheaply, we can take any water wherever we are and turn it into whatever we need.
It's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst.
Every time you contract a muscle, it emits a little electricity that you can record with antennae or electrodes and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis.
It's about seven pounds, which is probably about what my arm would weigh if I lost it right here.
So Amanda, when you first started using this arm, how long did it take to use it?
AK: It took just about probably three to four hours to get it to train.
I had to hook it up to a computer, so I couldn't just train it anywhere.
So if it stopped working, I just had to take it off.
So now it's able to train with just this little piece on the back.
And I believe Dean Kamen presented it at TED a few years ago.
She had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis that then she rubbed over different surfaces, and she could feel different textures of sandpaper, different grits, ribbon cable, as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin.
So I use sculpture and music to make it, not just visible, but also tactile and audible.
What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art, versus science.
This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it.
You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture.
You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture.
You place it in a science museum, it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data.

But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent.
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150.
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison.
It also leads to status insecurity.
It was like manna from heaven.
Well it allowed you to do that.
It allowed you to bomb only those things that you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb.
And whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane, it's escorted there by a series of armed guards.
And it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it.
And there's a little incendiary device inside of it, so that, if the plane ever crashes, it will be destroyed and there's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it.
Well, it turns out it's not the Holy Grail.
First of all, it's really hard to use -- really hard to use.
Secondly, it breaks down a lot.
It's full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys and gadgets and ball-bearings, and they don't work as well as they ought to in the heat of battle.
Well it is the grandson of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.
It is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision.
You might ask: with all the things cancer's trying to do to kill our patient, how does it remember it's cancer?
When it winds up its genome, divides into two cells and unwinds again, why does it not turn into an eye, into a liver, as it has all the genes necessary to do this?
It remembers that it's cancer.
We have this molecule, but it's not a pill yet.
It's not orally bioavailable.
We need to fix it so we can deliver it to our patients.
It's funded by foundations.
I chose papercutting because paper is cheap, it's light, and you can use it in a lot of different ways.
And I chose the language of silhouette because graphically it's very efficient.
I was also interested in the physicality of this format, because you have to walk to see it.
They were installed in the museum on two floors, but in fact, it's a continuous image.
And I call it "Hells and Heavens" because it's daily hells and daily heavens.
And I call it "Hells and Heavens" because it's daily hells and daily heavens.
And the reason their information has any value is, well, because no one else has access to it.
And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you, the information that the FBI has has no value, so thus devaluing their currency.
Because it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything.
I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete, because you're all doing it.
I'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete, because you're all doing it.
After 10 years of experiments, I found it.
Would you like to see it? I brought some with me.
It's called oxytocin.
It can't be that important."
But knowing that molecule is valuable, because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off.
In particular, it tells us why we see immorality.
Opens it up and there's a pearl necklace inside.
Now that doesn't sound like a lot, but it's very important, because being able to deliver the Transition as a light sport aircraft makes it simpler for us to certify it, but it also makes it much easier for you to learn how to fly it.
Radio: It actually flew. Yes.
Instead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger, park it in your garage.
What about the problem of picking up a chess piece, dexterously manipulating it and putting it back down on the board?
It's a hard problem because the water sloshes about, but it can do it.
It's a high school sport where you have 12 cups you have to stack and unstack against the clock in a prescribed order.
We use it in the engineering and neuroscience sense meaning a random noise corrupting a signal.
So for example, if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand, you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback.
I'm not going to explain what that formula is, but it's very beautiful.
And it has real beauty and real explanatory power.
And what it really says, and what you want to estimate, is the probability of different beliefs given your sensory input.
Imagine you're learning to play tennis and you want to decide where the ball is going to bounce as it comes over the net towards you.
And moreover, it profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do.
So as you send a movement command down, you tap a copy of that off and run it into your neural simulator to anticipate the sensory consequences of your actions.
And if I've got a good predictor, it predicts the same thing.
I get you tapping on it, and I get me shaking it, but from my senses' point of view, that is combined together into one source of information.
I get you tapping on it, and I get me shaking it, but from my senses' point of view, that is combined together into one source of information.
It's been known for a long time, you can't tickle yourself as well as other people can.
So it really suggests, when you're doing this -- based on this study and others we've done -- that the brain is canceling the sensory consequences and underestimating the force it's producing.
And it uses it very differently once you think about it that way.
And it uses it very differently once you think about it that way.
Consider for a moment this quote by Leduc, a hundred years ago, considering a kind of synthetic biology: "The synthesis of life, should it ever occur, will not be the sensational discovery which we usually associate with the idea."
That's his first statement. So if we actually create life in the laboratories, it's probably not going to impact our lives at all.
It forms a surface that is, say, chemically active.
It's actually quite lifeless. Once it forms, it doesn't really do anything.
It's a pool of water, and the protocell starts moving itself around in the system.
Okay? Oil droplet forms through self-assembly, has a chemical metabolism inside so it can use energy, and it uses that energy to move itself around in its environment.
It is moving around, exploring its environment, and remodeling its environment, as you see, by these chemical waves that are forming by the protocell.
So it's acting, in a sense, like a living system trying to preserve itself.
The protocell moves. It encounters the food.
It reconfigures itself and actually then is able to climb to the highest concentration of food in that system and stop there.
Now, this doesn't have a brain, it doesn't have a neural system. This is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior.
So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it, thinking it was some crap laying around.
But as soon as they passed by, it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.
And it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.
His head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts, that it's sort of fallen into his hat, and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.
And it very slowly, over a few minutes, sort of painfully goes up, and then it gains momentum and it looks like it's almost about to fall.
But it doesn't really need it, because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.
And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall, because if we made it in a way that it would topple over, then it would damage itself, and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism, or that sense of wanting to go and help it.
And it was very important for us to establish the exact moment that it would fall, because if we made it in a way that it would topple over, then it would damage itself, and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism, or that sense of wanting to go and help it.
Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.
But he doesn't need to, because it manages to lift itself up on its own.
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it -- almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something.
And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting to create a dynamic with people moving around it -- almost like it were trying to conceal a secret within its seams or something.
So we work with a lot of technology, but we don't really love technology, because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.
But we use it because we're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create.
But we use it because we're interested in the way that it can help us to express the emotions and behavioral patterns in these creatures that we create.
And once a creature pops into our minds, it's almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move.
It's about a little boy whose father was a history buff and who used to take him by the hand to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis on the outskirts of their camp.
Let me show you how it works.
Our heritage is much more than our collective memory -- it's our collective treasure.
We owe it to our children, our grandchildren and the generations we will never meet to keep it safe and to pass it along.
Most people, when they first look at a fresh human brain, they say, "It doesn't look what you're typically looking at when someone shows you a brain."
Typically, what you're looking at is a fixed brain. It's gray.
It's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement.
There's a blade here that's going to cut across a section of the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide.
We're going to then apply one of those stains to it, and we scan it.
And this is just showing this here -- this frozen tissue, and it's being cut.
And remember, it's frozen.
We take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray.
There's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn, it allows you to zoom in, it allows you to highlight individual structures.
As long as it's fun and it seems like it's going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time, then that's enough for us.

YR: Exactly. There is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons: so I can repair it afterward and especially so nobody takes that, just on his head.
So I went to work programming it, and I released it just before the holidays in 2010.
When we design the app and we sell it, it will be free to local districts and other districts that we sell to, all the money from that will go into the local ed foundations.
So the first thing you're going to see is the normal worm when it's about college student age -- a young adult.
It's quite a cute little fellow.
Is it miserable? It doesn't seem to be.
One gene is changed out of 20,000, and look at it.
So part of it is like a baseball glove.
It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.
It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.
Under those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue has gone into the nucleus -- that little compartment there in the middle of the cell -- and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.
Under those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue has gone into the nucleus -- that little compartment there in the middle of the cell -- and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.
And it's just sitting on one of them.
And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes, genes I call carrot-giver genes, whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well -- to fold correctly and function correctly.
And it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they're damaged.
You can store the food, use it for energy, grow, etc.
But it's deteriorating.
And then the hurricane comes through, and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.
And not only that, it can also just last longer, even if there isn't a hurricane.
And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse -- even when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human, that old for a mouse -- if you give the mouse rapamycin, it will live longer.
Although you're looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me, what you could do now pretty well in the lab, if you were allowed ethically, is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer?
If the Sun could one day -- and indeed the Earth, in fact -- if the Earth could read its own astrological, astronomical chart, one day it would say, "Not a good day for making plans.
For me, it's a very, very important thing.
Even though I know the chair is made of atoms and therefore actually in many ways empty space, I find it comfortable.
Due to the Ballbot system, it has a very small footprint and it's also easy to move around.
It was venerable.
It was ubiquitous.
But it was a little bit boring.
It also provides a third of the food we eat.
It opens our hearts, and makes us realize we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it.
It opens our hearts, and makes us realize we are a part of nature and we're not separate from it.
it makes you want to go deeper in so you can get more and see beautifuller things, like the path, if it's a path, it could lead you to a beach, or something, and it could be beautiful.
We so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment, with clouds coming and going.
I got my tattoo when I was 29, and I regretted it instantly.
And by "regretted it," I mean that I stepped outside of the tattoo place -- this is just a couple miles from here down on the Lower East Side -- and I had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight on the corner of East Broadway and Canal Street.
It's called a lobotomy.
It requires, first of all, agency -- we had to make a decision in the first place.
And second of all, it requires imagination.
You're going to experience more regret in that situation if you missed your flight by three minutes than if you missed it by 20.
We just want it to vanish.
And do you guys just want to see it?
Because it's actually not that hideous.
When other people see my tattoo, for the most part they like how it looks.
It's just that I don't like how it looks.
But I'll let you see it anyway.
And what I loved about this image of the compass was that I felt like it encapsulated both of these ideas in one simple image.
And I thought it might serve as a kind of permanent mnemonic device.
But it turns out, it doesn't remind me of the thing I thought it would; it reminds me constantly of something else instead.
It actually reminds me of the most important lesson regret can teach us, which is also one of the most important lessons life teaches us.
It makes it hotter. It's happening right now.
It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized, and if you focus them into a beam, what you have is an incredibly useful tool.
The control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye, you can use it to store massive amounts of data, and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain.
Little by little it gets colder until eventually it approaches absolute zero.
It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid.
For example, if you shine light through a superfluid, it is able to slow photons down to 60 kilometers per hour.
Another spooky property is that it flows with absolutely no viscosity or friction, so if you were to take the lid off that bottle, it won't stay inside.
Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds.
When a chemical signal washes up on one side, it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side, because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment.
In fact, most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so bad.
I mentioned earlier the fact that music is a different capacity because it's abstract.
When you hear music, if it doesn't sound good, what's the point?
So if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant, what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission.
You distort it a little bit, especially in terms of pitch, and you've changed it.
You distort it a little bit, especially in terms of pitch, and you've changed it.
Now the next question is, well how does it really sound?
It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India, it helped Martin Luther King win his historic racial struggle.
It helped a local, Lech Walesa, to kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland, and in beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it.
It was on Tahrir square, where the international community was constantly frightened that, you know, the Islamists will overtake the revolution. What they organized -- Christians protecting Muslims where they are praying, a Coptic wedding cheered by thousands of Muslims, the world has just changed the picture, but somebody was thinking about this previously.
And then, it's about the humor. Humor is such a powerful game-changer, and of course, it was very big in Poland.
There is also one big thing about humor, it really hurts.
It can put the price tag of state-sponsored violence over a nonviolent protester.
And the reason it is there is to make sure you, the entity filling out the form, are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times.
So you start with a book, and then you scan it.
And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because, you see, one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book, it didn't know what it was, and it's going to present it to you.
But since it doesn't know the answer for it, it cannot grade it for you.
And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer, it assumes you are human, and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly.
It's the word "Christians"; there's nothing wrong with it.
But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word, bad things can happen.
So what we've been working on for the last year and a half is a new website -- it's called Duolingo -- where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the Web.
Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works.
And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software.
And not only do they learn it as well, but actually it's way more interesting.
So it's extremely unfair towards the poor.
To give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like, this is a dragline silk protein, it's just a portion of it, from the black widow spider.
It's short. And on the bottom, this is the repeat sequence for the egg case, or tubuliform silk protein, for the exact same spider. And you can see how dramatically different these silk proteins are -- so this is sort of the beauty of the diversification of the spider silk gene family.
This makes testing spider silk really, really easy to do in the laboratory, because we're actually, you know, testing it in air that's exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins.
In the case of the capture spiral, it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey.
If it wasn't able to stretch so much, then basically when an insect hit the web, it would just trampoline right off of it.
Scytodes doesn't use a web at all to catch prey. Instead, scytodes sort of lurks around and waits for prey to get close to it, and then immobilizes prey by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect.
So the way I perceive a mistake when I'm on the bandstand -- first of all, we don't really see it as a mistake.
He'll introduce it for a second and then I'll stop, I'll talk for a second.
Here it is on the top of the building with plenty of windows to let light in.
Well if cancer can be caught early, enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out, excised with surgery, I don't care if it has this gene or that gene, or if it has this protein or that protein, it's in the jar.
But then we actually don't know that it's all out.
But here it is. It's fluorescent.
Now it's green.
And the cool thing about fluorescence is that it's not only bright, it actually can shine through tissue.
So even if the tumor is not right on the surface, you'll still be able to see it.
That you can, not only see the margins right there on a molecular level, but you can see it even if it's not right on the top -- even if it's beyond your field of view.
But sentinel lymph node, the way that we do it today, is kind of like having a road map just to know where to go.
It doesn't tell you whether or not the gas station has gas.
It was associated largely with the construction industry.
So we take a carrot cake, put it in a blender, and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice, and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream, I guess, and it comes off looking like, you know, Jupiter's floating around your plate.

HC: And here's something we have no reference to eat. This is a cigar, and basically it's a Cuban cigar made out of a Cuban pork sandwich, so we take these spices that go into the pork shoulder, we fashion that into ash. We take the sandwich and wrap it up in a collard green, put an edible label that bears no similarity to a Cohiba cigar label, and we put it
And a miracle berry, if you're not familiar with it, is a natural ingredient, and it contains a special property.
And a miracle berry, if you're not familiar with it, is a natural ingredient, and it contains a special property.
It's a glycoprotein called miraculin, a naturally occurring thing. It still freaks me out every time I eat it, but it has a unique ability to mask certain taste receptors on your tongue, so that primarily sour taste receptors, so normally things that would taste very sour or tart, somehow begin to taste very sweet.

HC: You're about to eat a lemon, and now it tastes like lemonade.
We could eliminate sugar across the board for all confectionary products and sodas, and we can replace it with all-natural fresh fruit.
HC: So if miracle berries take sour things and turn them into sweet things, we have this other pixie dust that we put on the watermelon, and it makes it go from sweet to savory.
So after we do that, we put it into a vacuum bag, add a little bit of seaweed, some spices, and we roll it, and this starts taking on the appearance of tuna.
So the key now is to make it behave like tuna.
As long as it's good for you and good for the environment, it doesn't matter.
My left leg got caught up in the wheel well -- spun it around.
The bumper of the car hit my throat, slicing it open.
It foamed, and horrible things were happening to me.
I say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it.
I say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it.
So they basically put a map up on the wall, threw a dart, and it landed at a senior home here in Colorado.
If it's hit, don't cross the street."
So one day I was in my room and I saw this thing sitting in my room and I thought it was a monster.
And I go, "I'm just going to touch it."
And I touched it and I went, "Oh my God, it's a laundry basket."
And I touched it and I went, "Oh my God, it's a laundry basket."
And there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it; we should just leave it alone, it's not to be solved.
And there are actually many people that think we should not even touch it; we should just leave it alone, it's not to be solved.
So it provides certain areas for perception and image-making.
And for a long time, people did not even want to touch it, because they'd say, "How can you have this reference point, this stability, that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day?"
The autobiographical self is built on the basis of past memories and memories of the plans that we have made; it's the lived past and the anticipated future.
And these women sing an enchanting song, a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die."
It's in control. It's in power right now.
It has these strong, heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth.
And then when you're ever in a situation where you don't have a commitment device in place -- like, "Oh my God, that person's offering me a doughnut, and I have no defense mechanism," -- you just eat it.
The more you exercise it, the stronger it gets.
The more you exercise it, the stronger it gets.
It wants to consume.
It took quite many years for the program to become what it is now.
How do we live it successfully?
Obviously, there's no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth.
Now we're all born with spirit, all of us, but sometimes it gets tamped down beneath the challenges of life, violence, abuse, neglect.
It's also moving vertically.
And where, at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law, on the international stage it is not.
It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.
And it goes: "Every man's death affected me, for I am involved in mankind, send not to ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee."
And it goes: "Every man's death affected me, for I am involved in mankind, send not to ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee."
The first stage was completed at home, which consisted of marinating the chicken, grilling the chicken, amassing it and preparing it to be transported to the lab.
The second stage was completed at the Penn State University main campus lab, which is where I extracted the chemicals, changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment and separated the compounds I needed from the rest of the chicken.
But yet, it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States.
And in fact, it might be changing the cells themselves to make the cells resistant.
After all, my story begins with a dried, withered spinach plant and it's only getting better from there.
I'm going to show it to you on my laptop.
So I'm very passionate about this research and I really want to continue it and expand it to more disorders besides asthma, more respiratory disorders, as well as more pollutants.
Dialogue is not easy -- not between individuals, not between groups, not between governments -- but it is very necessary.
But the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it.
And not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most.
To test water, you simply insert a sample and, within seconds, it either displays a red light, indicating contaminated water, or a green light, indicating the sample is safe.
If you were making a TV show, it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made; it only had to be better than the two other shows that were on at the same time -- which is a very low threshold of competitive difficulty.
But this taping business, fine, let it go.
If they break it, they will break it for everybody.
It has quite a long lineage.
You find it in Buddhism, you find it in 17th, 18th-century philosophy going through to the current day, people like Locke and Hume.
And this data gets sent to a machine that slices the data into two-dimensional representations of that product all the way through -- almost like slicing it like salami.
It's actually using a laser to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer.
Typically, because we can create products very rapidly, it's been used by product designers, or anyone who wanted to prototype a product and very quickly create or reiterate a design.
It's a lighter part and it uses less material waste.
Typically an implant is more effective within the body if it's more porous, because our body tissue will grow into it.
And we're starting to see it being used for final end products.
If I gave you a 3D printer, you wouldn't know how to direct it to make what you want it to.
If I gave you a 3D printer, you wouldn't know how to direct it to make what you want it to.
You can just make it physically on the spot.
It means we've got to get out of here.
We've all had stress creep up on us without even noticing it until we lost it on someone who didn't deserve it, and then we realize that we probably should have checked in with ourselves a little earlier.
As you focus on the wooden form, it rotates.
It understands what's inside of you and builds a sort of responsive relationship between you and your technology so that you can use this information to move you forward.
It's how we understand the world inside and reflect it outside into this tight loop.
As it aligns with our human behaviors, it can allow us to make better sense of what we do and, more importantly, why, creating a big picture out of all the important little details that make up who we are.
And when this story posted, I ran to my computer to send it to the IMF official.
You could even hear it.
It was our last resort.
My father was there to provide it.
It removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies.
We can think of a cell from an electrical perspective as if it's a mini space station.
And it prevents them from forming those chains, those mitotic spindles, that are necessary to pull the genetic material into the daughter cells.
But what we can see is, by month six, the tumor has responded and it's begun to melt away.
It's still there.
This graph looks boring, but it is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning.
And this machine is able to enable surgery and save lives because it was designed with this environment in mind.
It's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms, and it needs special care, TLC, to keep it up and running, and it's going to break pretty easily.
It's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms, and it needs special care, TLC, to keep it up and running, and it's going to break pretty easily.
And when it does, it needs a team of biomedical engineers who understand its complexities, can fix it, can source the parts and keep it saving lives.
And when it does, it needs a team of biomedical engineers who understand its complexities, can fix it, can source the parts and keep it saving lives.
Now we know room air is gloriously free, it is abundant, and it's already 21 percent oxygen.
So all this concentrator does is take that room air in, filter it and send 95 percent pure oxygen up and across here where it mixes with the anesthetic agent.
Now before that mixture hits the patient's lungs, it's going to pass by here -- you can't see it, but there's an oxygen sensor here -- that's going to read out on this screen the percentage of oxygen being delivered.
Now if you don't have power, or, God forbid, the power cuts out in the middle of surgery, this machine transitions automatically, without even having to touch it, to drawing in room air from this inlet.
It's also designed for the environment that it will be used in.
It has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts.
And so it's not going to break very easily, but if it does, virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a hex wrench and a screwdriver.
And finally, it's affordable.
So in other words, what we have here is a machine that can enable surgery and save lives because it was designed for its environment, just like the first machine I showed you.
So we're taking this machine and recreating some of the operating theater crises that this machine might face in one of the hospitals that it's intended for, and in a contained, safe environment, evaluating its effectiveness.
I think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health.
And it really seems peripheral, we never think about it, until we don't have access to it, and then it becomes a gatekeeper.
And when it fires a little spike of electricity, there's going to be a red dot and a click.
And it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike.
So that's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it's exploring around.
And as it moves around, the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is, so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment.
And indeed, you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex, which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats.
Maybe it's been towed.
But he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.
But he knows where it was, so he knows to go and get it.
And one study that I found, a particularly interesting one, was actually in Queensland, because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly.
It was used indiscriminately.
So this was one particular problem they talked about, that it might be used indiscriminately.
Both myself and my brother belong to the under 30 demographic, which Pat said makes 70 percent, but according to our statistics it makes 60 percent of the region's population.
It's a natural component for bringing people together, discussing ideas -- in the same way we're doing here at TED.
Khaled: Why would I want to put it on?
Pachycephalosaurus has a big, thick dome on its head, and it's got some little bumps on the back of its head, and it's got a bunch of gnarly things on the end of its nose.
It's inflating very fast.
But it's got these big holes in its shield.
"And it has holes in its frill."
But to give it to ourselves right now means a level of arrogance or cockiness that we're not comfortable with.
As long as we make leadership something bigger than us, as long as we keep leadership beyond us and make it about changing the world, we give ourselves an excuse not to expect it every day, from ourselves and from each other.
It's interesting, because it was six years ago when I was pregnant with my first child that I discovered that the most commonly used preservative in baby care products mimics estrogen when it gets into the human body.
We turn on the faucet, the water comes out, we assume it's safe, and we assume that we are masters of our environment, rather than being part of it.
And the fishermen would tie a net off the headland, string it out along the other net.
And as the shark came round, it would hit the net, the net would collapse on it.
Or at times, they would row out in their small currachs and kill it with a lance through the back of the neck.
And basically it spent all its time, the last eight months, in Irish waters.
Christmas day it was out on the shelf edge.
And on one occasion when we were up in Malin Head up in Donegal, a shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail, more, I think, in startle to the fact that a boat came near it, rather than the tag going in.
And I remembered -- I used to spend a lot of time out on commercial fishing boats -- I remember fishermen telling me they can always tell when a basking shark's been caught in the net because it leaves this black slime behind.
So I scraped the slime off and I sent it off to Aberdeen.
So by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat -- you see, here's a shark that's running under the boat here -- we managed to collect slime.
83 percent of them took action -- evidence that it is indeed empowering.
It is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect.
And not only is it empowering to the communities, but really importantly, this information stays in the community where it is needed to formulate long-term health polices.
Well, the wintering ground is also critical and it also is not protected, and is potentially, could be potentially, exploited for gas and mineral rights.
It impacts and fragments a larger part of the wilderness, where there is 90 percent reduction of key species, like woodland caribou and grizzly bears, and it consumes even more energy, more water, and produces at least as much greenhouse gas.
This is one of the reasons why it's called the world's dirtiest oil.
It's also one of the reasons why it is the largest and fastest-growing single source of carbon in Canada, and it is also a reason why Canada is now number three in terms of producing carbon per person.
It's carcinogenic."
And what we're doing is we're destroying this carbon sink, turning it into a carbon bomb.
It compromises the life and the health of some of our most underprivileged and vulnerable people, the Aboriginal communities that have so much to teach us.
And it's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet.
This empire is, in fact, the Middle East as we now know it, and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.
It was the largest empire the world had known until then.
Much more important, it was the first multicultural, multifaith state on a huge scale.
And it had to be run in a quite new way.
This time, the real politics of the contemporary world -- the year of the Balfour Declaration, the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain, decides that it will declare a Jewish national home, it will allow the Jews to return.
It's shown being presented here, put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran, one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions, Mrs. Ardakani.
It is a document that can mean so many things, for Iran and for the region.
It will appear, certainly, in many more Middle Eastern stories.
So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa, had written his own book on the subject, I couldn't wait to read it.
It's called apropos of the Italian adage that I lifted from his forward, "If This Be Treason."
But the reason that I mention it is that early on, Rabassa offers this elegantly simple insight: "Every act of communication is an act of translation."
If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum, I'd say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies.
If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum, I'd say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies.
It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different way of seeing and ultimately being in the world.
It's part of our survival package, and that's why it's become so important for us, and that's why we're always listening at that level.
Now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people's walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection.
Remove it from your household.
And one last powerful attribute that comedy has as communication is that it's inherently viral.
Shortly after the conference was over, Joel got a request for a signed copy from the head of the EPA in Washington whose wall it now hangs on.
And not long after that, he got another request for a copy from the head of the EPA in California who used it as part of her presentation at an international conference on climate change in Sacramento last year.
They cannot have money go away from their paycheck into a 401 plan before they see it, before they can touch it.
So we've got these challenges, and what Richard Thaler and I were always fascinated by -- take behavioral finance, make it behavioral finance on steroids or behavioral finance 2.0 or behavioral finance in action -- flip the challenges into solutions.
It's an autopilot.
There's a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again and again and again.
It involved 17 different projects around the world.
And I hope you'll appreciate the level of global coverage that it managed to achieve.
It's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida.
This particular shrimp, we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp, it's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago -- at least it was, until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia.
This particular shrimp, we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp, it's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago -- at least it was, until the census discovered it was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia.
Now this little critter, it's only about half a millimeter in size, not terribly charismatic.
But it was only discovered in the early 1980s.
But the really interesting thing about it is that, a few years ago, census scientists discovered that this guy can thrive in oxygen-poor sediments in the deep Mediterranean Sea.
And so as we see in this image of light during the night, there are lots of areas of the Earth where human development is much greater and other areas where it's much less, but between them we see large dark areas of relatively unexplored ocean.
I'm not saying it's not nice or pleasant or that it's bad for polar bears or forests, though it certainly is.
It will stop because of the end of trade resources.
It will stop because of the growing demand of us on all the resources, all the capacity, all the systems of the Earth, which is now having economic damage.
Although growth has certainly delivered many benefits, it is an idea so essential that we tend not to understand the possibility of it not being around.
Even though it has delivered many benefits, it is based on a crazy idea -- the crazy idea being that we can have infinite growth on a finite planet.
That the crazy idea is just that, it is crazy, and with the Earth full, it's game over.
We need it to develop technology.
We need it to keep social stability.
In my view, it is well underway.
We tend to look at the world, not as the integrated system that it is, but as a series of individual issues.
Of course, if the robot were tilted, inclined to the horizontal, then it would accelerate in this direction.
So to get it to tilt, there's one of two ways of doing it.
No matter how you throw it, the robot recovers and comes back to him.
And it does that avoiding obstacles.
Here you have overhead motion capture cameras on the top that tell the robot where it is 100 times a second.
So another thing the robot can do is it remembers pieces of trajectory that it learns or is pre-programmed.
So it has to do this because this gap in the window is only slightly larger than the width of the robot.
So it knows how to combine little bits and pieces of trajectories to do these fairly difficult tasks.
So in this video you see -- and it's sped up 10, 14 times -- you see three different structures being built by these robots.
And it uses these sensors to build a map of the environment.
The coordinate system is defined based on the robot, where it is and what it's looking at.
And it navigates with respect to those features.
So the robot then figures out what the features are, it builds the map, it figures out where it is with respect to the features, and then estimates its position 100 times a second, allowing us to use the control algorithms that I described to you earlier.
So here, the robot is not only solving the problem of how to go from point A to point B in this map, but it's figuring out what the best point B is at every time.
So essentially it knows where to go to look for places that have the least information, and that's how it populates this map.
So before I play this video, I want to tell you that they created it in the last three days, after getting a call from Chris.
It's making a promise to you that this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time.
I don't mean to make it sound like this is an actual exact science, it's not.
It can't be artificially evoked.
That may not sound like much, but when added up over the whole world, it's enormous.
It's about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity.
It's equivalent to exploding 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year.
Now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple, honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed 100 percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis, with the government not keeping one dime.
It doesn't matter how many times you download Steven J.'s Stanford commencement address, you still look at it and decide not to do it.
"But. I had a dream too, once, kid, but I was afraid to pursue it."
But sometimes it's as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase.
And once people circle around some sacred object or value, they'll then work as a team and fight to defend it.
Is it a product of natural selection, like our hands?
Or is it a bug, a mistake in the system -- this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain -- Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience, it's just a mistake?
In "The Descent of Man," Charles Darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality -- where did it come from, why do we have it.
In "The Descent of Man," Charles Darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality -- where did it come from, why do we have it.
Now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years, but it's about to make a major comeback this year, especially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April, making a very strong case that we, and several other species, are products of group selection.
If a group cannot solve the free-rider problem then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection cannot get started.
It's not that hard a problem.
In fact, nature has solved it many, many times.
A superorganism can basically take what it wants.
It's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens, from the defectors, the cheaters.
I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug, but if it is an adaptation, then the implications are profound.
If it is an adaptation, then we evolved to be religious.
And most importantly, if the staircase is real, it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life.
Now rather than just argue about this number, a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across Ocean Boulevard to the Westin, and then to Mars ...
Some people think this number's a little bit large, but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year.
So I looked back up and she said, "Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube?"
It fuels our daily lives.
The thing to understand about shame is, it's not guilt.
The other thing you need to know about shame is it's absolutely organized by gender.
Shame feels the same for men and women, but it's organized by gender.
I don't know how much perfume that commercial sold, but I guarantee you, it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds.
And to get out from underneath it -- to find our way back to each other, we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we're parenting, the way we're working, the way we're looking at each other.
And to get out from underneath it -- to find our way back to each other, we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we're parenting, the way we're working, the way we're looking at each other.
If you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow exponentially: secrecy, silence and judgment.
If you put the same amount in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy, it can't survive.
If you put the same amount in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy, it can't survive.
It's 130 octane fuel.
It's 25 percent cleaner than oil.
It's ours, we have an abundance of it.
And it does not require a refinery.
It comes out of the ground at 130 octane.
Run it through the separator and you're ready to use it.
It's going to be very simple for us to use.
It will replace or be able to be used for that.
Today it's two dollars and forty cents.
You burn it, you release CO2.
CA: No, no. The argument that it's a bridge fuel makes sense, because the amount of CO2 per unit of energy is lower than oil and coal, correct?
And he said, "Well it's a bridge fuel, is what it is."
That is, it's going to be a small part, because you can't rely on it.
You'll keep using it. It is the cleanest of all.
You'll keep using it. It is the cleanest of all.
The Ft. Worth T has been on it for 25 years.
Mortality is not going down, it's going up.
And you can see, it's lumpy bumpy.
And the poem, if it's written with the ear, already has been set to its own verbal music as it was composed.
But I like to pretend that it comes with ease.
And it uses the imagery of dollhouse furniture.
The next poem is called forgetfulness, and it's really just a kind of poetic essay on the subject of mental slippage.
BC: The next poem is called "The Country" and it's based on, when I was in college I met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine.
It's called "The Country."
If it has a subject, the subject is adolescence.
And it's addressed to a certain person.
It's called "To My Favorite 17-Year-Old High School Girl."
Then I remembered the quote from Gloria Steinem, which goes, "The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off."  So --  So with that in mind, I'm going to set about and talk about dying in the 21st century.
With it, we could draw electricity from the sun even when the sun doesn't shine.
It's about 50 feet wide and recedes about half a mile -- row after row of cells that, inside, resemble Volta's battery, with three important differences.
It's fitted with solid electrodes and an electrolyte that's a solution of salt and water.
I called it the shotglass.
It's going to be 36 inches in diameter.
We call that the bistro table, but it's not ready yet for prime-time viewing.
So you see, the liquid metal battery story is more than an account of inventing technology, it's a blueprint for inventing inventors, full-spectrum.
Because when you ask it, you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you, how it keeps us from attempting great things, and life gets dull, amazing things stop happening.
Because when you ask it, you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you, how it keeps us from attempting great things, and life gets dull, amazing things stop happening.
And we are flying it, or trying to.
It's boosted to near-space atop a Minotaur IV rocket.
We call it rocketcam.
And it's pointed at the hypersonic glider.
It can fly up, down, forwards, backwards, even upside-down.
It weighs less than one AA battery.
It does not eat nectar.
In 2008, it flew for a whopping 20 seconds, a year later, two minutes, then six, eventually 11.
They are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces.
It was made in tobacco plants.
For 15 years, it was unsolved in the scientific community.
And others, also connected to the Internet, used it as an instrument of democracy.
And so in the second flight, we were able to get three minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it.
CA: And to carry a payload of more than a few pounds?  Like what's the payload it could carry?
We've got to fly it first.
And one of the guys who already had a seat was very -- because Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws, and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric.
Without it, a script is just words.
It's the sensible shoe of public address.
The Dietrich book was an observation by her daughter; it was a biography.
Now I took this diagram, and I put it in a Photostat machine,  and I took a piece of tracing paper, and I taped it over the Photostat with a piece of Scotch tape -- stop me if I'm going too fast --  -- and then I took a Rapidograph pen -- explain it to the youngsters --  and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur.

Augusten Burroughs wrote a memoir called ["Dry"], and it's about his time in rehab.
Usually on the first day of Introduction to Typography, you get the assignment of, select a word and make it look like what it says it is. So that's Type 101, right?
I want this book to look like it's lying to you, desperately and hopelessly, the way an alcoholic would.
I set up the type, I printed it out on an Epson printer with water-soluble ink, taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it. Presto!
Then when we went to press, the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running.
But the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf.
And so, we're talking about parallel planes of existence, sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers.
So even though we love publishing as an art, we very much know it's a business too, and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky, that great art can be great business.
If you put it all together in one place, it'd be the size of South America.
But what's really interesting is, this water's got to come from some place, and it comes from here, the Colorado River in North America.
Well, this is a lot of water, and again, we're mining water and using it to grow food, and today, if you travel down further down the Colorado, it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean.
The reason it's here is because, on the right-hand side, you see two little rivers kind of coming down through the sand, feeding this basin with water.
And it rivals climate change in importance.
In fact, we completely depend on it.
It's not optional. It's not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity.
But it's not the only problem.
It generates 30% of greenhouse gas emissions.
How do we feed the world without destroying it?
So before going to law school in China I bought a banjo, I threw it in my little red truck and I traveled down through Appalachia and I learned a bunch of old American songs, and I ended up in Kentucky at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention.
The European rabbit has no natural predators in Australia, and it competes with native wildlife and damages native plants and degrades the land.
You can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy as it travels through the bloodline.
This piece is ordered by age because it can't be ordered by blood.
And yet, speculative though the idea surely is, I aim to convince you that there's reason for taking it seriously, as it just might be right.
And yet, speculative though the idea surely is, I aim to convince you that there's reason for taking it seriously, as it just might be right.
Instead they found that it's speeding up, going faster and faster.
That's like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster.
What's pushing on it?
Expressed in the relevant unit, it is spectacularly small.
Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality, and this peculiar number may be doing just that, as the only approach that's so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes -- an idea that naturally emerges from string theory, which takes me to part two: string theory.
It says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely, at first you'll find molecules and then you'll find atoms and subatomic particles.
It has internal inconsistencies, unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar -- extra dimensions of space.
It's called inflationary cosmology, which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space.
The fuel is based on something called a quantum field, but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it's virtually impossible to use it all up, which means in the inflationary theory, the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one-time event.
And so exotic as this picture is, it may one day be grounded in observations, establishing the existence of other universes.
You cannot deal with a city if it's not socially integrated.
JS: Cuts itself. Fold. The fold is important because it allows interstitial suspension.
And she was fascinated by this, and she started to cry, and I started to cry, and her father started to cry, and now we're all crying. He didn't expect to come home from work to the Middle Passage, but there it goes.  And so, we made this game, and she got it.
She got it because she spent time with these people.
It wasn't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie.
And the more I learned about the Mexican culture -- my partner is Mexican — the more I learned that, you know, for all of us, food is a basic need, but, and it is obviously with Mexicans too, but it's much more than that.
It's an expression of love. It's an expression of — God, I'm totally choking up way more than I thought.
It's an expression of beauty. It's how they say they love you.
And what's fantastic is that this symbol is not a thing, it's not an image, it's not an artifact, actually it's a space, and it's kind of just defined by a line of buildings on either side.
It's a space where citizens can voice their discontent and show their power.
It's a place where pivotal moments in American history have taken place.
It would have the global reach of the World Economic Forum.
It would have the interdisciplinarity of the TED Conference.
It would have the informality of the town square.
It can't go in the Mall.
It can't go in the courtyard.
But how could it take the space of that hole and not be buried in it invisibly?
How could it become iconic?
It has to be different from the buildings there.
It has to be something entirely different.
It has to be air.
In our imagination, it has to be light.
It has to be ephemeral. It has to be formless.
And it has to be free.
It's a giant airbag.
The expansion takes the shape of its container and it oozes out wherever it can -- the top and sides.
It's made of silcon-coated glass fiber.
And it's inflated twice a year for one month at a time.
But today's energy system is not just inefficient, it is also disconnected, aging, dirty and insecure.
So it needs refurbishment.
By 2050 though, it could become efficient, connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos, factories and buildings all relying on a modern, secure and resilient electricity system.
General Eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies.
In one minute -- and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is.
Don't worry about dropping it, it's tougher than titanium.
Don't worry about dropping it, it's tougher than titanium.
Tom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer without even scuffing it.
In other words, oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices before it becomes unavailable even at high prices.
And whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same, about six trillion dollars at present value -- whether we buy more of what we've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal, or renewables that are more or less centralized.
So to solve the energy problem, we just needed to enlarge it.
Efficiently used, it really can do our work without working our undoing.
And our new book "Reinventing Fire" describes how you can capture it.
Right here I'm adding a sine wave with four peaks and turning it on.
It's wavy.
RM: The "Double Raindrop" I worked on for nine months, and when I finally turned it on, I actually hated it.
The very moment I turned it on, I hated it.
But just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us, it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world.
Today, what many of us would love to believe is that the Internet is a private place; it's not.
Privacy is not an option, and it shouldn't be the price we accept for just getting on the Internet.
And I think one of the problems with classical economics is it's absolutely preoccupied with reality.
It's exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box, but it has no control over the circumstances.
What they don't say is, "Well the numbers all seem to add up, but before I present this idea, I'll go and show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better."
The accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights; it goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights.
The accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights; it goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights.
When you drive away, your car feels as if it drives better.
And for him, it wasn't so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you.
Both my parents really loved it.
They didn't know all that much about it, but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them.
And I think inspired by that memory, it's been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as I can, sort of pass it on through whatever means.
And how people get this music, how it comes into their lives, really fascinates me.
Now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord, even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room.
And the reason you like it is because you've inherited, whether you knew it or not, centuries-worth of changes in musical theory, practice and fashion.
In 200 B.C., a man named Sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the Greeks.
And from this moment, classical music became what it most essentially is, a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature: instinct and intelligence.
I find it such a profound one.
Where does it go? What's left?
Mostly it's been a person-to-person thing, and then around 1880 came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally created a new and miraculous way of passing things on, albeit an impersonal one.
It spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing.
I never know who might be there, who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life.
And it excites me now to meet people who are hikers, chefs, code writers, taxi drivers, people I never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on.
And apparently it's being remade right now and it's going to be coming out next year.
One group of people said you can distill your information, you can extract value, separate it and serve it up, while another group turned around and said no, no you can ferment it.
I always get goosebumps every time I see it.
And what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery of what pollinated a unique flower.
So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it.
They took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place.
And you know what? It worked.
In fact, it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of Limburger cheese that we're using in Tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos than humans.
Limburg, be proud of your cheese, as it is now used in the fight against malaria.
It's about man's best friend. It's about dogs.
And so we set up another crazy experiment, because we collected the smell of these larvae, put it on pieces of cloth, and then did something very remarkable.
And then you see the dog. It's called Tweed. It's a border collie.
But when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce, they estimate it at zero percent.
It's quite widespread.
But the question is, is it good for us?
So they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being.
Controlled experiments have shown that optimism is not only related to success, it leads to success.
Yes, smoking kills, but mostly it kills the other guy.
And by the way, when I asked him about his own likelihood of divorce, he said he was quite sure it was zero percent.
It has generated considerable insight in physics, in biology and economics, but not that much in the humanities and in history.
It will be able to reveal new trends in our history, sometimes to explain them, and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen.
And he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin.
And they were holding it in their laps.
He turned it into an adventure for the kids.
And so I've heard Doug tell the story many times, of his personal transformation and the breakthrough design that happened from it, but I've never really seen him tell the story of the little girl without a tear in his eye.
You want to be able to open it up, crack it open, look at the wiring inside.
It's gray, formless.
There's no structure. It won't tell you anything.
Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue, it somehow only stains about one percent of them.
It clears the forest, reveals the trees inside.
So somehow it shows what's there.
Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell, that cell will glow green -- or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein, you get a cell to glow many different colors.
And it's so called, of course, because all of these neurons are glowing different colors.
You go on the back of that truck, it takes your photo, 30 seconds later take it from the side, you're ready to rock.
What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters.
He called it the virus -- Latin for "poison."
And I think if we phrase that lesson, it's something like this: Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story.
Now improvisation is empowering because it welcomes the unknown.
Now this kingdom had many resources and mighty ambitions, but the one thing it lacked was people.
And so it invited workers from around the world to come and help it build the nation.
The kingdom argues that its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners who pose a risk to the economy or the security or the public health or the morals of the state.
Only about half of the people who need treatment are currently receiving it.
It's a song about people and sasquatches --  And other French science stuff.
It will get here, there's no question.
It's believable, it's tactile.
Like, for example, what if it could go to a dinner party at the White House?  So, because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware, we decided that, rather than have a robot replace the human to go to the party, we'd have a human replace the robot.
When the Industrial Revolution started, the amount of carbon sitting underneath Britain in the form of coal was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under Saudi Arabia in the form of oil, and this carbon powered the Industrial Revolution, it put the "Great" in Great Britain, and led to Britain's temporary world domination.
It comfortably accommodates one teenager and it's shorter than a traffic cone, and it's almost as efficient as a bicycle as long as you drive it at 15 miles per hour.
It's buried treasure.
It was finished by a guy called Johannes Myrones on the 14th of April, 1229.
It got in worse condition in the 20th century after Heiberg saw it.
Forgeries were painted over it, and it suffered very badly from mold.
It's the sort of book that you thought would be in an institution.
But it's not in an institution, it was bought by a private owner in 1998.
So it took four years to take apart.
If you merge them together into one digital canvas, the parchment is bright in both images and it comes out bright.
And it'll come out dark but red, and then you can start to read it rather clearly.
Well we took the manuscript, and we decided to image it in X-ray fluorescence imaging.
So we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory in California, which is a particle accelerator.
And it's an attractive and beautiful future, if only we can make it happen.
In fact, it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth.
Contrary to the clash of civilizations theory, Arabs didn't despise Western liberty, they desired it.
It actually got harder.
But Drake's idea here became very popular because it was very appealing — and I'll get back to that — and on the basis of this experiment, which didn't succeed, we have been doing SETI ever since, not continuously, but ever since.
It's exponentially improving. Now, exponential is an overworked word. You hear it on the media all the time.
Well, at 9:30 in the morning, with my head down on my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night, the phone rings and it's The New York Times.
It shows like roughly one third of the public thinks that aliens are not only out there, we're looking for them out there, but they're here, right?
It can address the problem by getting young people interested in science. Look, science is hard, it has a reputation of being hard, and the facts are, it is hard, and that's the result of 400 years of science, right?
And I bet the answer you're going to get, is, "Well, I don't know what the Higgs boson is, and I don't know if it's important."
I think that if you can instill some interest in science and how it works, well, that's a payoff beyond easy measure. Thank you very much.
For some reason it explodes, and you begin to get these things.
And what you're looking at is columns of dust where there's so much dust -- by the way, the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles -- and what's happening is there's so much dust, it comes together and it fuses and ignites a thermonuclear reaction.
And then what happens is there's enough dust left over that it doesn't ignite into a star, it becomes a planet.
And life starts to expand and expand and expand, until it goes kaput.
And what those four chemicals do is they take any cell and take it way back up the mountain so it can become any body part.
And what those four chemicals do is they take any cell and take it way back up the mountain so it can become any body part.
And I think we see this tremendous variation because it's a really effective solution to a very basic biological problem, and that is getting sperm in a position to meet up with eggs and form zygotes.
And it's really an odd sort of structure.
Before it can be used for internal fertilization, its mechanical behavior has to change in a really dramatic fashion.
Most of the time it's a flexible organ.
But before it's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid, it has to become difficult to bend.
And moreover, it has to work.
If you have fluid with no wall to surround it and keep pressure up, you have a puddle.
It lengthens, shortens and bends really easily in response to internal or external forces.
So I went ahead, collected wall tissue, prepared it so it was erect, sectioned it, put it on slides and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look, fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety.
So I went ahead, collected wall tissue, prepared it so it was erect, sectioned it, put it on slides and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look, fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety.
If the wall around the erectile tissue wasn't there, if it wasn't reinforced in this way, the shape would change, but the inflated penis would not resist bending, and erection simply wouldn't work.
And once that happened, once this material was in Latin, it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years.
Now, I'm sure you recognize this object; many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days.
And it is perhaps the best example we have in Los Angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture.
It was first excavated in 1961 as they were building LAX, although scientists believe that it dates back to the year 2000 Before Common Era, when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants.
It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located, of course, at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design, the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously, the much better access to parking.
When it was uncovered, it ushered in a new era of streamlined, archaically futuristic design called Googie, which came to be synonymous with the Jet Age, a misnomer.
After all, the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often, preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls.
I like to read books on it.
I use it every day to measure the weight of an ox, for example.
Or I should say, what it did was it took technology which, unlike people in this room, to many other people in the world, still feels very alien, and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate.
Or I should say, what it did was it took technology which, unlike people in this room, to many other people in the world, still feels very alien, and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate.
And unlike the juicy salif, it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain, rather, it simply attaches itself to your brain.
But it diminishes considerably.
What we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory, but in order for us to do that, we had to create these very sophisticated measures, measures of how people, how little babies, how newborns, engage with the world, moment by moment, what is important, and what is not.
It happens moment by moment in their real lives, and their minds are being formed, and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers.
Because after all, they learn about the world almost like about it, rather than learning how to function in it.
It's letting stuff happen without thinking about it.
It should imagine a user.
I knew design was important in my house because, for heaven's sake, it put food on our table, right?
You gotta make it your own. You gotta design it.
It's how you cover it that matters.
It mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune, and it projects that message, that story, so strongly that it almost blots out anything else.
An object devoid of intent -- it's random, it's imitative, it repels us. It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away.
That if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly, that we all harbor one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare: that it keep us healthy.
It's just a set of choices that people make.
I believe that at the end of the day when we measure our healthcare, it will not be by the diseases cured, but by the diseases prevented.
It will not be by the excellence of our technologies or the sophistication of our specialists, but by how rarely we needed them.
And most of all, I believe that when we measure healthcare, it will be, not by what the system was, but by what we chose it to be.
As a human being, it puts the fear of God in me.
It's a remarkable comment on slums, poverty and aspiration.
Sixty years after the film was made and 30 years after I first saw it, I see young faces tilt up in awe, their incredulity matching mine.
And the speed with which they associate it with "Slumdog Millionaire" or the favelas in Rio speaks to the enduring nature.
It shows how to do right, how to be heroically awkward.
It is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor.
How has the world changed? How could it be different?
If we want different values we have to tell a different story, a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person's identity, that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity, and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group.
He was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me, but he told me that when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with, they present them with a pebble -- the perfect pebble.
It's really scary, this gay lifestyle thing; it's super duper evil and there's no end to it!
It goes and goes and engulfs!
There it is!
Some of you may be calling it, what, the Constitution of the United States, is that what you call it too?
But there it is. The gay agenda.
But when you see the map, and you see our state of Michigan -- it's legal to fire someone for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, that it's legal to remove someone from their home because they're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality is not about stripping someone's rights away, it's about granting them the rights that [have] already been stated.
And suddenly it was over for me. That's it.
This? It goes every which way. It's like a cartoon, the falls, and that's what I love the most about it.
It's fairly mellow, and it's beckoning to do bank tricks, right?
It's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it and steer it to do things it was never intended to do, right?
It's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it and steer it to do things it was never intended to do, right?
You can be a Linux kernel hacker, make it more stable, right?
I've had a patent, and that was cool, and we started a company, and it grew, and it became the biggest, and then it went down, and then it became the biggest again, which is harder than the first time, and then we sold it, and then we sold it again.

What is it that will punch you and make you do something and bring it to another level, and when you've had it all, sometimes, guys, they die on the vine with all of that talent, and one of the things we've had, all of us, is fame, I think the best kind of fame, because you can take it off.
The first chapter of every case is exactly the same, and it is tragic.
It begins with the murder of an innocent human being, and it's followed by a trial where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row, and that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate court.
And he was learning how, when you have a big old gnarly problem, sometimes the solution is to slice it into smaller problems.
But every once in a while, as Dwight Eisenhower said, the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger.
It was the day that he was going to be executed, and we were just talking.
And this energy now is harvested throughout the year, sent into the grid, is replacing fossils in the grid, and when I need it for the cooling, I take it back from the grid and I use the solar energy which I have brought to the grid back when I need it for the solar cooling.
It's like a video game obstacle course. And I've gotten better and better at doing this. Even when I make a painting, I actually imagine I'm behind the painting, it already exists, and someone's looking at it, and I see whether they're feeling it from their gut.

It really teaches us who we are, and helps us in the world, but it's really my creativity that's taught me that I can be much more than what my education told me I am.
It lets us create who we are, and curate what is to come.
It'll render the human condition radically different from what it is today.
The world needs this kind of expertise, and it rewards the kind of people willing to acquire it.
It's actually running at real rate right now, one second per second, and in fact, Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan at I think it's 38,000 miles per hour.
You can manipulate it yourself.
For example, if you have read — I suspect many of you have done so — read the book by Thomas Friedman called "The World Is Flat," he said, basically, in his book that, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong because it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented.
When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation, what we found was, India is well represented in innovation, but the innovation that is being done in India is of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did was we called it "invisible innovation."
What the global delivery model allows is, it allows you to take previously geographically core-located tasks, break them up into parts, send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists, and then specify the means for reintegrating them.
Now in the old days, that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically, maybe getting sidetracked, that was fun.
It mentioned leopards and ring-tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then coleoptera, which turn out to be beetles.
And he didn't just leave it, he circled it once.
But instead of going into a store and buying one, like we do normally, he went to this website and he downloaded a file, and then he printed it on this printer.
If you have an idea, you just go and you make it.
Or, the software is GPL, so it's open-source as well.
Or this machine here, it's from the DIY bio movement, and it's one of the steps that you need in order to process DNA, and again, it's completely open-source from the ground up.
And so when we had to make our own educational robot, we just went to them and said, you know, "You design it, because you know exactly what is needed to make a great robot that excites kids."
So the idea is that the hardware, the software, the design of the object, the fabrication, everything about this project is open-source and you can make it yourself.
They have no fear of technology, because it's not there.
But just as the Internet drops transaction and collaboration costs in business and government, it also drops the cost of dissent, of rebellion, and even insurrection in ways that people didn't understand.
It protects the birds.
"'I give life and I take it away.
Now, it's quite an old phenomenon; it was discovered 100 years ago.
But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field?
Why? Because as long as it rotates, the locking is maintained.
So, we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet.
And again, that's not all. I can adjust its position like this, and rotate, and it freely moves in this new position.
I can take this disk and put it here, and while it stays here -- don't move -- I will try to rotate the track, and hopefully, if I did it correctly, it stays suspended.
Every time a new technology is being introduced, criminals are there to exploit it.
It already has a 70 percent mortality rate if you get it, but it's hard to get.
Or what if we sent it out to a few thousand?
Or, controversially, and not without its risks, what happens if we just gave it to the whole public?
I was working on a very interesting technology at MIT, but it was a very long-term view of how to develop technology, and it was going to be a very expensive technology, and also it would be patented.
Normally it's at the back.
So we may have developed the technology which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy, but the idea is, what is the purpose of technology if it doesn't reach the right hands?
They also made it into an Instructable, and in less than one week, they had almost 10,000 views, and they got many new friends.
And what puts us together is that we have a common, at least, global understanding of what the word "business" is, or what it should be.
UR: I'd never learned it before, but he told me that we would be playing that on stage, so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it.

My doctor told me that in order to heal my brain, I had to rest it.
It said, "You're never going to get better."
It just vanished. It felt like a miracle.
Even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS.
And I could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me.
I mean, if it hadn't worked for me, there's no way I would have believed it was possible.
I mean, if it hadn't worked for me, there's no way I would have believed it was possible.
Instead, we can use it as a springboard to unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives.
It gets stronger the more you exercise it.
So the microbial community can go wrong whether we want it to or not, or we can kill it with antibiotics, but what can we do to restore it?
We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible.
We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible.
It's very similar to a Rubens' tube, and it's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sound, such as eigenmodes, so let's fire it up and see what it does.
It's very similar to a Rubens' tube, and it's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sound, such as eigenmodes, so let's fire it up and see what it does.
Ooh.  Okay. Now, while the table comes up to pressure, let me note here that the sound is not traveling in perfect lines. It's actually traveling in all directions, and the Rubens' tube's a little like bisecting those waves with a line, and the flame table's a little like bisecting those waves with a plane, and it can show a little more subtle complexity, which is why I like to use it to watch Geoff Farina play guitar.
It shows very well that eyes can hear, and this is interesting to me because technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound, such as the removal of time.
At least, it's powerful enough that if I show you these four songs, and I remind you that this is "Smells Like Teen Spirit," you can probably correctly guess, without listening to any music at all, that the song a die hard Nirvana fan would enjoy is this song, "I'll Stick Around" by the Foo Fighters, whose lead singer is Dave Grohl, who was the drummer in Nirvana.
It listens to the lecture, and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis, and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y-axis.
It's all eight hours of the Cambridge lecture series taken in as a single visual impression, and I really like this image, but a lot of people think it's fake.
There's no closed captioning for the TED theme song, and we're missing it, but if you've watched enough of these, you hear it in your mind's ear, and then applause starts.
It usually begins here, and it grows and then it falls.
It's another one of those categories where maybe there's not a lot of competition.
But this is P1. It's an entirely student-built electric vehicle, which through using its rear-wheel drive and front-wheel steer-by-wire can drift around corners.
It can get sideways like a rally car driver, always able to take the tightest curve, even on slippery, changing surfaces, never spinning out.
Every time her ex-boyfriend would show up, at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations, he was carrying an open laptop, and over time Carol realized that he had planted a GPS tracking device on her car, so she was calling me for help to disable it.
At first, the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers, though we eventually got it packaged into a small box.
So this piece memorializes my friends in these jars, and they actually move around.  So, this is interesting to me, but it lacked a certain human element.  It's a digital sculpture, so I wanted to add an interaction system. So what I did was, I added a proximity sensor, so that when you get close to the people in jars, they react to you in different ways.
You can walk away, you can just watch as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you, or you can actually choose to interact with it.
So I like this about interactive video sculpture, that you can actually interact with it, that all of you can actually touch an artwork and be part of the artwork yourselves, and hopefully, one day, I'll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars.  Thank you.
It grows and then it grows, and then it makes this handsome man.
It could. It has the genetic information.
So, why doesn't it do it?
So for various reasons, we took this oncogene, attached it to a blue marker, and we injected it into the embryos.
So, when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish, we got a mass of blue cells.
And many of you know how it looks, except that inside that breast, there are all these pretty, developing, tree-like structures.
It has a bottom, it has a top, it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk, because it just came from an early pregnant mouse.
I said, if it's true that architecture is dominant, architecture restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it's normal.
And maybe my discovery needs to be added to or maybe it needs to be changed.
And when we revert the cancer cell, it again does this.
It's called "Among the School Children."
It's got to come from us, and I see this process of deciding democratically in a bottom-up fashion what the world wants to work on together as one vital means by which we can crowdsource the force to really build that constituency that's going to reinvigorate global governance in the 21st century.
It's a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me —  — and sends this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me through the bone, through bone conduction.
It had become a part of my body, an extension of my senses, and after some time, it even became a part of my official image.
So depending on how I display it, I can hear and I can compose music with food.
I heard a telephone tone, and it felt green because it sounded just like the color green.
It's active in the Gulf of Guinea.
At the ceremonies, when these young men and women graduate, they take that pen with great pride, and put it in their pocket.
It's called the Comfort.
You have to dial it in, and as I think about how we create security in this 21st century, there will be times when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis, but there will be many instances, as we've talked about today, where our militaries can be part of creating 21st-century security, international, interagency, private-public, connected with competent communication.
It needs to be alert, for which caffeine is very good.
Simultaneously, it needs to be calm -- not agitated, calm -- for which chamomile is very good.
And the feedback in all these cases is concrete, it's unambiguous; you know if you've solved the puzzles or not.
So wouldn't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do, as we're walking around being able to point a phone at anything, and then have it actually recognize images and objects like the human brain, and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of knowledge and experiences and ideas.
What we have here is a painting of the great poet Rabbie Burns, and it's just a normal image, but if we now switch inputs over to the phone, running our technology, you can see effectively what Tamara's seeing on the screen, and when she points at this image, something magical happens.
Not only that, but as I move the object around, it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly.
Not only that, but as I move the object around, it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly.
So then, after the fun, comes the more emotional side of what we do, because effectively, this technology allows you to see the world through someone's eyes, and for that person to be able to take a moment in time and effectively store it and tag it to something physical that exists in the real world.
In the last 20 years, it's really changed the way that we live and work, and the way that we see the world, and what's great is, we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift, because now we can literally take the content that we share, we discover, and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us.
It's not taught in universities.
We extended this idea. We tested it many times over, and the next version we came up with was a box that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy, but most importantly connect to a car battery, because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power in places where there's not enough electricity or erratic electricity.
So ...  So I take it into the start position, and then I press the read button.  So it's taking a little reading from you.  And then the pointer goes and points to three different options.

Luckily, not today. And if it had pointed to the orange or the amber, it basically meant you had to have, sort of, more continuous care from the health care worker.
We are going through some reference tests to compare it against professional equipment to see if there's a degree of change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact in people's lives. But most importantly, what we are trying to do right now is we are trying to scale this up, because there are over 250,000 ASHA workers on the ground who are these amazing foot soldiers, and if we can

It was designed, and parts of it were prototyped, and the bits of it that were built are here in South Kensington.
And he thought about using binary. The problem with using binary is that the machine would have been so tall, it would have been ridiculous. As it is, it's enormous.
Now, if we look at this, and we stop for a minute, and we think about chips today, we can't look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny.
You're not just going to have that, So, first of all, you had sound. You had a bell, so if anything went wrong —  — or the machine needed the attendant to come to it, there was a bell it could ring.  And there's actually an instruction on the punch card which says "Ring the bell." So you can imagine this "Ting!"
The Duke of Wellington is there, you know, get out the machine, obviously demonstrates it, and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime, really, who said, "I understand what this does, and I understand the future of this machine."
If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom.
Whether it's video or text or music or voice, it's all numbers, it's all, underlying it, mathematical functions happening, and Lovelace said, "Just because you're doing mathematical functions and symbols doesn't mean these things can't represent other things in the real world, such as music."
This was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying, "We could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs," —  — and Lovelace is there and she says, "Look, this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically."
We could go back to Babbage's machine and just make it tiny. All those things are computers.
In fact, it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers, only really slowly.  To give you an idea of how slowly, it had about 1k of memory.
It used punch cards, which were being fed in, and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.
It did have a RAM pack.
One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan 28, and that is also the name of a charity that I started with Doron Swade, who was the curator of computing at the Science Museum, and also the person who drove the project to build a difference engine, and our plan is to build it.
The third part is a computer simulation of that machine, and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum.
Babbage himself wrote, he said, as soon as the analytical engine exists, it will surely guide the future course of science.
Of course, he never built it, because he was always fiddling with new plans, but when it did get built, of course, in the 1940s, everything changed.
Of course, he never built it, because he was always fiddling with new plans, but when it did get built, of course, in the 1940s, everything changed.
Now, we can take this form and use the same process to generate three-dimensional structures, but rather than folding things by hand, we'll bring the structure into the computer, and code it as an algorithm.
The physical model, on the other hand, is 2,700 layers, one millimeter thick, it weighs 700 kilos, it's made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium.
I first saw it when I was 19, and I immediately went out and got a poster of it, and in fact I still have that poster. 30 years later it's hanging in my house.
I first saw it when I was 19, and I immediately went out and got a poster of it, and in fact I still have that poster. 30 years later it's hanging in my house.
It's accompanied me everywhere I've gone, I never tire of looking at her.
And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.
The light comes in from the left, his face is bathed in this glowing light. It's right in the center of the painting, and you look at it, and I found that when I was looking at it, I was standing there going, "Look at me. Please look at me."

And we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily, but not really, and we come back again and again.
They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury, and then they discovered that it wasn't him, and they have no idea who it is.
They can't hang it on the wall, because they don't know who he is.
It's short.
It's on the rooftop, right on the corner there, and it's been there for a couple of years now.
A bee isn't going to sting you if you see it.
It prevents weird things from the north.
But it didn't change the Chinese political system, and also the Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen its power to counter the local government and the different factions.
And in this particular case, this is the climax of the movie, and, you know, the weight of achieving it was simply take a model, throw it out of a helicopter, and shoot it.
So basically, if there's two subs in the same shot, I shot it, because where's the camera coming from?
RL: So, what I did is basically I had another screening room experience where I was basically tracking where I was looking, or where we were looking, and of course you're looking at the two people on the bow of the ship, and then at some point, I'm changing the periphery of the shot, I'm changing, it's becoming the rusted wreck, and then I would run it every day, and then I would find
Very dangerous, very impossible to do, and particularly on our stage, because there literally is no way to actually move this train, because it fits so snugly into our set.
So here we have this piece of music by Beethoven, and my problem with it is, it's boring.
I had to practice it as a kid, and I'm really sick of it. So --  I would, so what I might like to try to do is to change it, to transform it in some ways, to personalize it, so I might take the opening, like this idea --  and then I might substitute --  and then I might improvise on that melody that goes forward from there --
I'm really leaning into me, because I, because I have to think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly as that Beethoven text is running in time through my head and I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations I'm going to make to it.
So this is an engaging enterprise for me, and I've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there, and now my face appears twice, so I think we can agree that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise.  But it's an engaging one, and it's interesting to me for a while, but then I get bored with it, and by it, I actually mean, the piano, because it becomes, it's this familiar instrument, it's timbral range is actually
pretty compressed, at least when you play on the keyboard, and if you're not doing things like listening to it after you've lit it on fire or something like that, you know.
I took the idea of the wristwatch, and I turned it into a musical score.
I was a bit mischievous. In fact, to make it more interesting, I put a space right in here, and this is the actual title of the piece.
I recorded an awesome singer, and I took the sound of his voice in my computer, and I warped it in countless ways to come up with the soundtrack that you're about to hear.
And what do you do with this food? You cook it!
Join me. Use -- I've got a lot of energy. Help me use it.
But even in parts of the world like the United States where education is available, it might not be within reach.
Whether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India and would never have access in this case to a Stanford-quality course and would never be able to afford it.
Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material in order to really understand it.
Personalization is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities here as well, because it provides us with the potential of solving a 30-year-old problem.
He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people.
It's the beginning.
then when the song kind of bubbled back up in his brain, he just thought it was his song.
We know this tune, right? We know it?
Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready and then it is inevitable."
You can do multi-fingered gestures on it, and boy have we patented it.  KF: Yes. And yet, here is multi-touch in action.
It's called vegetable tourism, and believe it or not, people come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds, even when there's not much growing.  But it starts a conversation.  And, you know, we're not doing it because we're bored.  We're doing it because we want to start a revolution.
We've not asked anybody's permission to do this, we're just doing it.  And we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start, and most importantly of all, we are not daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say, "These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems," because I have seen the power of small actions, and it is awesome.
And meditation or self-inspection is one of the ways -- again it's not the only one -- it's one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power.
And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun, put her hand on it and lower it.
My fear grows fat on the energy I feed it.
And if it grows very big it probably happens.
And you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants, what it needs.
And you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants, what it needs.
But anger is like gasoline, and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match, you've got an inferno.
It lists every known mental disorder.
And it used to be, back in the '50s, a very slim pamphlet.
And then it got bigger and bigger and bigger, and now it's 886 pages long.
I didn't know which of these was true, but I thought it was kind of interesting, and I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry to get their view, which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists.
It was a man called Brian, who runs a crack team of Scientologists who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies.
So he was going down the psychopath checklist, basically turning it into "Who Moved My Cheese?"
Emergency preparedness is a big deal in disaster recovery because it makes towns safer and more resilient.
We're working on getting the software to places so people expect it, so people know how to use it and so it can be filled ahead of time with that micro-information that drives recovery.
If you don't tell us how you did it, we won't trust you.
The printing press was clearly the right medium for this, but the book was the wrong tool. It was too slow.
It was created by scientists, but it couldn't have been created if they didn't have a printing press as a tool.
It provides a canonical copy of the software on a server somewhere.
The only programmers who can change it are people who've specifically been given permission to access it, and they're only allowed to access the sub-section of it that they have permission to change.
And he called it "Git." Git is distributed version control.
It has two big differences with traditional version control systems.
And it includes this very evocative screenshot.
This shows you, for text that many people are editing, when a change was made, who made it, and what the change is.
It has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics.
It's the knockout.
You see it and you go, "Oh, my God. I'd buy that in a second!"
It won lots of awards.
I guess what I would say is, for us, for what I want to do, it's either too slow or it just doesn't work, it's ineffective.
Second, we took that lesson and tried to push it into our next project.
Of those newborns, one in 10 roughly, if it's not treated, the jaundice gets so severe that it leads to either a life-long disability, or the kids could even die.
It's very technological, it's very complex, a little daunting.
So again, if we want people to trust a device, it has to look trustworthy.
It only fits a single baby, and the idea here is it's obvious how you ought to use this device.
So the idea here is you want to make it hard to use wrong.
It is objectless. There are no things in it.
It is dimensionless. It is limitless.
It is endless.
You can see this work. It's on the mouth of the Mersey, just outside Liverpool.
If you hold your hand out in front of you, you can't see it.
I got to the airport, to the hotel, checked in, and, sitting there in the lobby, was a brochure for the Sydney Festival. I thumbed through it, and I came across a show called "Minto: Live."
We can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals on their cities, but I'm much [more] interested in many more things, like how a festival helps a city to express itself, how it lets it come into its own.
I thanked her, assuming it was fake, like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan.
It's caught here, frozen, shipped down to Lagos, smoked, and sold for a tiny increment of profit on the streets of Lagos.
It's sold at umbrella stands all over the streets, where people are unregistered, unlicensed, but MTN makes most of its profits, perhaps 90 percent of its profits, from selling through System D, the informal economy.
And so I just want to leave you there, and say that this economy is a tremendous force for global development and we need to think about it that way.
It's a sexy vision, for sure. Many have embraced it.
It's become the dominant school of thought in computer science.
But equally important is because health care has become so incredibly professionalized that it's become very remote and removed from local communities.
For me, what's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting, though, isn't that it simply makes health care more accessible and affordable but that it is also fundamentally empowering.
It empowers ordinary people to be more effective in caring for the health of others in their community, and in doing so, to become better guardians of their own health. Indeed, for me, task shifting is the ultimate example of the democratization of medical knowledge, and therefore, medical power.
This isn't my house. It is the people's house."
We don't have words, really, to describe it yet.
It was a center of entertainment, of energy production, of work, a center of health care.
So what's interesting is, then if you begin to add new things to it, like autonomy, you get out of the car, you park at your destination, you pat it on the butt, it goes and it parks itself, it charges itself, and you can get something like seven times as many vehicles in a given area as conventional cars, and we think this is the future.

You don't know if it's going to run you over.
You have to pedal to operate it in a bike lane, but if you're an older person, that's a switch.
And as the father was administering these instructions, a car drove by, slowly, and just after it passed the father and the teenagers, a hand went out from the front passenger window, and -- "Bam, Bam!" -- killing the father.
It had a driver and a passenger, and after the car had passed the judge by, the passenger extended his hand, pointed it back to the judge as the car continued on, just as the teenagers had described it, right?
and I want it to come and I want it to stop right in front of you, three to four feet away, and I want the passenger to extend his hand with a black object and point it right at you, and you can look at it as long as you want."
And that's what he saw.  You'll notice, which was also in my test report, all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side, which means that the shooter's face would have been photo-occluded. It would have been backlit.
We've spent the last couple of years pondering this, and so we developed a new technology, It's software and hardware, that actually can generate thousands and thousands of genetically diverse stem cell lines to create a global array, essentially avatars of ourselves.
So basically what he did was to take a healthy cell and turn it into a sick cell, and he recapitulated the disease over and over again in the dish, and this was extraordinary, because it was the first time that we had a model of a disease from a living patient in living human cells.
the very early stages of doing your assay development and your testing, you're not going to have to wait 13 years until you've brought a drug to market, only to find out that actually it doesn't work, or even worse, harms people.
Look around this room. We are all different, and a disease that I might have, if I had Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease, it probably would affect me differently than if one of you had that disease, and if we both had Parkinson's disease, and we took the same medication, but we had different genetic makeup, we probably would have a different result, and it could well be that a drug that worked wonderfully
It really has brought us to the threshold It's here now, and in our family, my son has type 1 diabetes, which is still an incurable disease, and I lost my parents to heart disease and cancer, but I think that my story probably sounds familiar to you, because probably a version of it is your story.
So many labs around the world are involved in this kind of research, and we now have a really rich and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops, and this picture has radically changed the way we think about human brain development by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood, and instead, the brain continues to develop right throughout adolescence and into the '20s and '30s.
It's proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species, and it's involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions, things like decision-making, planning, planning what you're going to do tomorrow or next week or next year, inhibiting inappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid.
It's also involved in social interaction, understanding other people, and self-awareness.
In other words, everything you need to do in order to remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed by mid-adolescence, whereas in contrast, if you look at the last two gray bars, there's still a significant improvement in the director condition between mid-adolescence and adulthood, and what this means is that the ability to take into account someone else's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior, which is something, by the way, that we do in everyday life all
So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain, and it's involved in things like emotion processing and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling out of doing fun things, including taking risks.
It gives you the kick out of taking risks.
If education can be likened to watering a garden, which is a fair metaphor, sadly, much of the water is evaporating before it reaches the flowers, especially for some groups, for example, those with hearing impairment.
So I took the food supply of every single country and I compared it to what was actually likely to be being consumed in each country.
It's called sheep's organs.
It's delicious, it's nutritious, and as I learned when I went to Kashgar, it symbolizes their taboo against food waste.
If we feed our food waste which is the current government favorite way of getting rid of food waste, to anaerobic digestion, which turns food waste into gas to produce electricity, you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide per ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs.
And I get into the trauma room, and they're waiting for me, and the lights are there, and I'd been able to breathe a little more now, because the blood has left, had been filling up my lungs and I was having a very hard time breathing, but now it's kind of gone into the stretcher.
It has truly revolutionized the way we communicate on the planet.
It has allowed momentous political change to take place.
Where does it come from?
Who makes it?
Now, it could happen, but I'm not going to plan my life around it.
There's something sacred about a space where you can work on a project, and you don't have to justify to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money, that it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible.
It just has to follow safety guidelines.
So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior, or body language -- but we call it nonverbals as social scientists -- it's language, so we think about communication.

So it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent, but do we like that person and how they interacted?
It's five minutes long. They are being recorded.
How good is it? What are their qualifications?
A few weeks ago, Dan posted a victorious post on our website, and I'd like to read it to you.
I'm sick of it.
It basically means to be human and to do the right thing.
So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory, to the CPU, the VRAM, etc., and it's an actual working computer. That's a bus, really.  And it looks kind of fast. That's a mouse driver, where it's XY.  It looks like it's happening kind of quickly, but it's actually a very slow computer, and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is,
But in '96, I made my last piece. It was in black and white, monochrome, fully monochrome, all in integer mathematics.
It's called "Tap, Type, Write."
I don't get it at all." That means art is working, you know?
It's like, art is supposed to be enigmatic, so when you say, like, "I don't get it," like, oh, that's great.  Art does that, because art is about asking questions, questions that may not be answerable.
You know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road, they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it.
Because at RISD, you have to look at the actual animal, the object, to understand its volume, to perceive it.
And I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named Tota Hasegawa. He's based in London, no, actually it's in Tokyo, but when he was based in London, he had a game with his wife. He would go to antique shops, and the game was as such: When we look at an antique we want, we'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique, and if it's a good story, we'll buy it.
And the shopkeeper would say, "It's old."  "Tell us more." "Oh, it's really old."  And he saw, over and over, the antique's value was all about it being old.
But I found a sign for Russian-speaking people, and it was the best sign ever to say no.
It's a hierarchy. We all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today, but as we know, it's been disrupted.
Now, I realize that this concept may sound a little Big Brother to some of you, and yes, there are some enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve, but ultimately, if we can collect our personal reputation, we can actually control it more, and extract the immense value that will flow from it.
Now the interesting thing is, reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale, but the sources it will be generated from, and its applications, are far bigger than this space alone.
Like a job interview. You sit across the desk from somebody, they have some prior image of you, you send signals across the desk to move their image of you from one place to a place where you want it to be.
It's now in Virginia and London. And we built software that'll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices up over the Internet. I guess we've done up to six machines at a time, but let's just focus on two.
When you graph the number of potential employees versus the number of jobs in the country, you see the gap gets bigger and bigger over time, and then, during the Great Recession, it opened up in a huge way.
Our technologies are great gifts, and we, right now, have the great good fortune to be living at a time when digital technology is flourishing, when it is broadening and deepening and becoming more profound all around the world.
And their first recommendation of how to fix this problem, because it is a problem, because it sends us all down blind alleys, their first recommendation of how to fix this problem is to make it easier to publish negative results in science, and to change the incentives so that scientists are encouraged to post more of their negative results in public.
The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons, and this study was never published; it's now a good example of publication bias.
But this problem of negative results that go missing in action is still very prevalent. In fact it's so prevalent that it cuts to the core of evidence-based medicine.
An architect designs a building, and it becomes a place, or many architects design many buildings, and it becomes a city, and regardless of this complicated mix of forces of politics and culture and economics that shapes these places, at the end of the day, you can go and you can visit them. You can walk around them.
A squirrel is chewing on your Internet."  And this seemed astounding. The Internet is a transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions.
It was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on.  But that in fact seemed to be the case.
The elders of the Internet were willing to part with it for a short while, and she looks at it and she says, "This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?"
The Internet was that amorphous blob, or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it.
They stretch across the ocean. They're three or five or eight thousand miles in length, and if the material science and the computational technology is incredibly complicated, the basic physical process is shockingly simple. Light goes in on one end of the ocean and comes out on the other, and it usually comes from a building called a landing station that's often tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood, and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor
Because once a country gets plugged in by one cable, they realize that it's not enough. If they're going to build an industry around it, they need to know that their connection isn't tenuous but permanent, because if a cable breaks, you have to send a ship out into the water, throw a grappling hook over the side, pick it up, find the other end, and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over.
Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship, and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place.
And then, once it was in the right place, he got back in the water holding a big knife, and he cut each buoy off, and the buoy popped up into the air, and the cable dropped to the sea floor, and he did that all the way out to the ship, and when he got there, they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie, and then he jumped back in, and he swam back to shore,
It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing.
Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic, could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences, but they could still sing the lyrics to a song, whether it was "Happy Birthday To You" or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones.
Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession.
It was oxygen. I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan, and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv, and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory, but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine. And that afternoon, I had to ask him,
It was my first audition, and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week, I was offered the position.
It was a landscape with figures, semi-dressed, drinking wine. There was a nude woman in the lower foreground, and on the hillside in the back, there was a figure of the mythological god Bacchus, and he said, "What is this?"
We live in an age of ubiquitous information, and sort of "just add water" expertise, but there's nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well-told narrative, what the curator does, the interpretation of a complex, esoteric subject, in a way that retains the integrity of the subject, that makes it -- unpacks it for a general audience.
It could have looked like shop windows on Fifth Avenue at Christmas, but because of the way that Andrew connected with the McQueen team, he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of McQueen, and the show was quite transcendant, and it became a phenomenon in its own right.
It gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe, but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passionate scholarship.
What he did was, he got a transparent pipe — have you seen this demonstration before? — he attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was, you had a situation where — I'll try and draw the tap and the pipe, actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard.
So the water goes up. He turns it back down. Great.
And then he turns the water up a bit, so it starts coming back in. And nothing changes.
There's this little flicker, and then as he turns it ever so slightly more, the whole of that green line disappears, and instead there are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle.
What's happened in this world of pipe is somebody has flipped it. They've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent.
But video has been left out. It arrived on the web in a small box, and there it has remained, completely disconnected from the data and the content all around it.
But video has been left out. It arrived on the web in a small box, and there it has remained, completely disconnected from the data and the content all around it.
It's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video with content pulled live directly from the web.
Popcorn immediately goes out onto the web, talks to Google, grabs the map, and puts it in the display.
I think it tries to be the best balance between actual representation and simplification -- the language of way-finding in our brain.
If you get a little baby, and you abuse it verbally, its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow, so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic.
It comes completely conscious. It's got state-of-the-art lobes.
One of the big things about countering terrorism is, how do you perceive it?
Both are fairly bad for your health.  If you look at it as a brand in those ways, what you'll come to realize is, it's a pretty flawed product.
Both are fairly bad for your health.  If you look at it as a brand in those ways, what you'll come to realize is, it's a pretty flawed product.
As we've said, it's pretty bad for your health, it's bad for those who it affects, and it's not actually good if you're a suicide bomber either.
It doesn't actually do what it says on the tin.
But what you realize, it's got an Achilles' heel.
We've mentioned the health, but it needs consumers to buy into it.
It's not just the marketeers of terrorism, which is those who finance, those who facilitate it, but it's the consumers of terrorism.
They are somebody who can actually stand there and say, "This product's crap. I had it and I was sick for days.
It burnt my hand, whatever." You believe them.
And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty.
Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you that actually it's a way of being.
What was really exciting about this project was we, and Beau, had no idea whether it would work.
It was completely new, and no one had done it before, including adults.  BL: Including the teachers, and that was really hard for the teachers.

So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it, but the next step is observation. So here are some of the students doing the observations. They're recording the data of where the bees fly.
It's not written by me. It's written by Amy and the other students in the class. As a consequence, this science paper begins, "Once upon a time ... "  The results section, it says: "Training phase, the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh." Right?  And the methods, it says, "Then we put the bees into the fridge ," smiley face. Right?  This is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published.

"I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways."  In other words, it starts off "once upon a time," the figures are in crayon, etc.  So we said, we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves, who is at the National Academy of Science, one of the leading neuroscientists in the world, and he says, "This is the most original science paper I have ever read" —  —

So what did we do? We send it back to the editor.
That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play, right?
AO: This project was really exciting for me, because it brought the process of discovery to life, and it showed me that anyone, and I mean anyone, has the potential to discover something new, and that a small question can lead into a big discovery.
A lot has been said and written about the unicorn, but if you take an X-ray of the unicorn, it becomes a puppy dog.
And what's interesting about this view is, again, it's a view that's held by pro-globalizers like Tom Friedman, from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted, but it's also held by anti-globalizers, who see this giant globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives if it hasn't already done so.
It was run by the great and powerful parents, and the people were helpless and hopeless naughty children.
Well, guess what? I won. Hooray.  Well, that's not exactly the story, because the problem was that Parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data, and then they tried to retrospectively change the law so that it would no longer apply to them.
It was an example of a culture clash that's happening all over the world between bewigged and bestockinged officials who think that they can rule over us without very much prying from the public, and then suddenly confronted with a public who is no longer content with that arrangement, and not only not content with it, now, more often, armed with official data itself.
I think that was a pretty good indication about my future career as an investigative journalist, and what I've seen from being in this access to information field for so long is that it used to be quite a niche interest, and it's gone mainstream. Everybody, increasingly, around the world, wants to know about what people in power are doing.
It zooms it off to the appropriate person, it tells you when the time limit is coming to an end, it keeps track of all the correspondence, it posts it up there, and it becomes an archive of public knowledge.
But the world isn't a fairy tale, and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge.
Equally, it could be better than we've been led to believe, but either way, we have to start seeing it exactly as it is, with all of its problems, because it's only by seeing it with all of its problems that we'll be able to fix them and live in a world in which we can all be happily ever after.  Thank you very much.

We need to get away from saying democracy matters because of the other things it brings.
Because they're very dangerous. If we set about saying, for example, torture is wrong because it doesn't extract good information, or we say, you need women's rights because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force, you leave yourself open to the position where the government of North Korea can turn around and say, "Well actually, we're having a lot of success extracting good information with our torture at the moment,"
It's not about the things that it brings.
It's not about the things that it brings.
The point about democracy is not that it delivers legitimate, effective, prosperous rule of law.
It's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors.
Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity, the dignity of the individual, the idea that each individual should have an equal vote, an equal say, in the formation of their government.
But if we're really to make democracy vigorous again, if we're ready to revivify it, we need to get involved in a new project of the citizens and the politicians.
It is a state of mind. It is an activity.
It seems that writers know that the child outside of family reflects on what family truly is more than what it promotes itself to be.
You couldn't see it from the street, because the home was surrounded by beech trees.
I have to tell it, because there was no one to put two and two together.
For over 50 years she ran it.
So one of the features of disgust that makes it such an interesting emotion is that it's very, very easy to elicit, in fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions, and so I'm going to show you that with a couple of images I can probably make you feel disgust.

"Even if I were hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly-swatter."
It has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these things that work together very dynamically and very efficiently, and so what I propose is that our building skins should be more similar to human skin, and by doing so can be much more dynamic, responsive and differentiated, depending on where it is.
First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy, and that's a very big deal for architecture.
First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy, and that's a very big deal for architecture.
What it is, it's a lamination of two different metals together.
And because it has two different coefficients of expansion, when heated, one side will expand faster than the other and result in a curling action.
So in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow air to ventilate through the system, and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen when also heated, and currently have this installation at the Materials & Applications gallery in Silver Lake, close by, and it's there until August, if you want to see it.
I'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market, and so here you see a pretty typical double-glazed window panel, and in that panel, between those two pieces of glass, that double-glazing, a thermo-bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and heats that interior cavity, that thermo-bimetal will begin to curl, and what actually will happen then is it'll start to block out the sun
On the left, it's when it's cold and the thermo-bimetal is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks, and on the right, the thermo-bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through, so those are two different components that I'm working on, and again, it's a completely different thing, because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls
If a child soils its nappy at 8:30, he will have to wait several hours before it can be changed again.
Like this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again.
And let's put it back into the deck, somewhere in the middle, and let's get started.
Winter is like magic. It's a time of change, when warmth turns to cold, water turns to snow, and then it all disappears.
But to really see the details of the bee, and really appreciate what it is, you have to look a little bit closer.
It's about a tenth of a millimeter.
This cell is looking for foreign objects, bacteria, things that it can find.
And it's looking around, and when it finds something, and recognizes it being foreign, it will actually engulf it and eat it.
So if you look right there, it finds that little bacterium, and it engulfs it and eats it.
So if you look right there, it finds that little bacterium, and it engulfs it and eats it.
It wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see when we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here, and you're a little bug, if you're on that surface of that flower, that's what the terrain would look like.
So this little ant that's crawling here, it's like it's in a little Willy Wonka land.
It's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see.
We don't realize it, but it's actually a record of that entire ecology.
Now, the Moon has no atmosphere, so micrometeorites come in continuously, and the whole surface of the Moon is covered with powder now, because for four billion years it's been bombarded by micrometeorites, and when micrometeorites come in at about 20 to 60,000 miles an hour, they vaporize on contact.
This grain of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion years old, and it's never eroded away like the way we have sand on Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling, air, and so forth. All you can see is a little bit of erosion down here by the Sun, has these solar storms, and that's erosion by solar radiation.
Now, if you look at this bat, it looks a little bit alien.
So therefore, if we were to do this, what we'd need to do is sequence that region in all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same or if it's different. So if it is the same, this indicates that that site is important for a function, so a disease mutation should fall within that site.
But we are going to have to understand it a bit better.
It was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought, we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund Movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level.
But he said, "We will partner with you, but we're not going to invest in it. You need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work."
It wasn't as successful as we thought it would be.
We let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way.
That diagonal line is the truth line. If their dot's on it, they were telling exactly the truth.
It's a very old literature by now, it's coming up on 50 years.
It's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials, hundreds of studies, and there's some really compelling findings.
That's really bad. Why is it so bad?
You remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were talking about before? Well, when they write a fake review, they have to post it somewhere, and it's left behind for us.
Our computer algorithm is very accurate, much more accurate than humans can be, and it's not going to be accurate all the time.
My outbox for email is massive, and I never look at it. I write all the time, but I never look at my record, at my trace.
But here in the United States, we ramp up the drama a little bit, and we drop our pots into sawdust, which catches on fire, and you take a garbage pail, and you put it on top, and smoke starts pouring out.
I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze, but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke, and what's wonderful is the surprises that happen, like this crackle pattern, because it's really stressful on these pots. They go from 1,500 degrees to room temperature in the space of just a minute.
It was supposed to break, but that's okay.   That's part of the letting go, is sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't, because creativity also grows from the broken places.
There they are in the school fields, but it's good and evil, and passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl with thousands of other people watching this performance, but she was ready. She was ready to open up to what it sparked in her, and it led her, as she said, down this path to become an award-winning filmmaker.
It's from 1656, and it's called "Las Meninas," and it's the picture of a little princess and her ladies-in-waiting, and if you look over that little blonde princess's shoulder, you'll see a mirror, and reflected in it are her parents, the King and Queen of Spain, who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture.
Richard Serra: I was standing there looking at it, and I realized that Velázquez was looking at me, and I thought, "Oh. I'm the subject of the painting."
It gets further and further away from the day, and light and seasons temper it in some way, and it's not that I'm a romantic. I'm really a realist.
But the person who put it back together, instead of hiding the cracks, decided to emphasize them, using gold lacquer to repair it.
This bowl is more beautiful now, having been broken, than it was when it was first made, and we can look at those cracks, because they tell the story that we all live, of the cycle of creation and destruction, of control and letting go, of picking up the pieces and making something new.
That's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad, where can I check it?
But when you get home or want to go indoors at your work, it's got to be small enough and maneuverable enough to use inside.
And furthermore, if you want it to last a long time out in rural areas, it has to be repairable using the local tools, materials and knowledge in those contexts.
So what's exciting about this system is that it's really, really mechanically simple, and you could make it using technology that's been around for hundreds of years.
So what's exciting about this system is that it's really, really mechanically simple, and you could make it using technology that's been around for hundreds of years.
So I'm an academic at MIT, and I'm a mechanical engineer, so I can do things like look at the type of terrain you want to travel on, and figure out how much resistance it should impose, look at the parts we have available and mix and match them to figure out what sort of gear trains we can use, and then look at the power and force you can get out of your upper body
So as a wet-behind-the-ears student, excited, our team made a prototype, brought that prototype to Tanzania, Kenya and Vietnam in 2008, and found it was terrible because we didn't get enough input from users.
it was heavy, it was hard to move around, so again with that user feedback, we went back to the drawing board, came up with a better design, 20 pounds lighter, as narrow as a regular wheelchair, tested that in a field trial in Guatemala, and that advanced the product to the point where we have now that it's going into production.
It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact on our everyday life. Consider these statistics released by Activision. After one month of release of the game "Call Of Duty: Black Ops," it had been played for 68,000 years worldwide, right?
It's better than those that don't play.
And it's better in two different ways.
Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it in the context of another group of technology users, a group which is actually much revered by society, which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.
What is multimedia-tasking? It's the fact that most of us, most of our children, are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they're doing search on the web at the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends.
Now in a sense, when we think about the effect of video games on the brain, it's very similar to the effect of wine on the health.
None of you.  And you probably have had that feeling, right, picking up an education game and sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun, it's not really engaging. So what we need is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate that is irresistible, that you really want to play, but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize
"No. That body is broken. It can no longer serve me."
The vertebra at L1 was like you'd dropped a peanut, stepped on it, smashed it into thousands of pieces.
And I thought, "How could it? Because I've lost everything that I valued, everything that I'd worked towards.
The pilot light inside of me was still a light, just as it is in each and every one of us.
It's a very powerful word, jihad, if you look at it in that respect, and there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it.
It's a very powerful word, jihad, if you look at it in that respect, and there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it.
He didn't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it and debased it and corrupted it and turned it into something it was never meant to be, and then persuaded all of us that it always was a global jihad.

And there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in, you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography, cell phones, and just as in the outer world, there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise, the more profitable it can potentially be.
Because I'm an extension of my work, and if they love me, then they will love my work, and if they love my work, then they will love poetry, and if they love poetry, then I will have done my job, which is to transcend it to the world.
You think black entertainers have it hard finding work in this business? I'm a suspicious mulatto, which means I'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right.
It costs a lot of money, a lot of time, and sometimes, even when a drug hits the market, it acts in an unpredictable way and actually hurts people.
And the later it fails, the worse the consequences.
Essentially, we're dramatically speeding up that feedback between developing a molecule and learning about how it acts in the human body.
The pool is already working today, two months later, with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product can go to market at low cost where and when it is needed. This is unprecedented.
So this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice, and yet it can do things that you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing.
And basically it's all evolved to handle its food source, which is dung.
And most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort.
Ten percent of the species actually make a ball, and this ball they roll away from the dung source, usually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source, and they have a very particular behavior by which they are able to roll their balls.
Its head is down. It's walking backwards.
It's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction, and at the same time it's got to deal with the heat.
The first is how it deals with this obstacle that we've put in its way. See, look, it does a little dance, and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place.
So clearly this animal knows where it's going and it knows where it wants to go, and that's a very, very important thing, because if you think about it, you're at the dung pile, you've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else, and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line.
But it doesn't flinch. It knows exactly where it wants to go, and it heads off in that particular direction.
It does a little double dance, and then it heads back in exactly the same direction it went in the first place.
The thing is the sun is not always available to you, because at sunset it disappears below the horizon.
The beetle comes out from underneath the filter and it does a right-hand turn, because it comes back under the sky that it was originally orientated to and then reorientates itself back to the direction it was originally going in.
And in this experiment here, what we did was we forced them into a channel, and you can see he wasn't particularly forced into this particular channel, and we gradually displaced the beetle by 180 degrees until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction that it wanted to go in, in the first place.
It isn't climbing. It isn't dancing, because its body temperature is actually relatively low.
So the ball leaves a little thermal shadow, and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face, and all the time it's trying to cool itself down, we think, and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across.
It's from a genus called Pachysoma.
There's one more interesting aspect of this dung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating, and that's that it forages and provisions a nest.
And what's taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot, it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food, and then when it finds food, it heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is.
Now there's two ways it could be doing that, and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it's at the foraging site.
If it's using landmarks, it will find its home.
If it is using something called path integration, it will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot, and what it's doing here if it's using path integration is it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction.
It knows the bearing home, and it knows it should be in that direction.
It starts to search for its house in the right distance away from the food, but it is clearly completely lost.
So we know now that this animal uses path integration to find its way around, and the callous experimenter leads it top left and leaves it.  So what we're looking at here are a group of animals that use a compass, and they use the sun as a compass to find their way around, and they have some sort of system for measuring that distance, and we know that these species here actually
You know, like sometimes you run into people that you think know the city well, but they don't know it that well.
It was a 7.6 magnitude. It was fairly big.
And 60 seconds is the amount of time it took for it to travel 250 kilometers to Managua.
So the ground shook in Managua 60 seconds after it hit the epicenter.
So this one wasn't a debunk, it was actually something that they could prove.
And we went back to Google Maps, and we looked a little bit closer, and sure enough, there's the white lilo, there are the two trees, there's the umbrella. It's actually folded in this photo.
So we were able to call Rita, clear the video, make sure that it had been shot, and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried.
So we were able to call Rita, clear the video, make sure that it had been shot, and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried.
So this video, I'm not going to show you the whole thing, because it's quite gruesome, but you'll hear some of the sounds.
So we talked to some sources in Hama who we had been back and forth with on Twitter, and we asked them about this, and the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify.
It had black-and-white curbs.
The bridge looks like it's crossing the river east to west.
Truth is emotional, it's fluid, and above all, it's human.
If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it, that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward, then you won't see why we go.
Scott, as many of you will know, was beaten to it by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team, who used dogs and dogsleds. Scott's team were on foot, all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges, and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there, I'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized.
What does it do really well? It creates economies of scale, significant and long-term resource investment, the expertise of many different kinds of people and different kinds of minds, and for individuals, consumers, it's bringing the standards, rules and recourse that we really want as consumers, and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise, and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation.

It just celebrated its seventh anniversary, and after seven years, last year it delivered 530 million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects.
A driver was telling me that they went to rent a car to go up the coast of France and the owner gave it to them, and said, "You know what, here's where the cliffs are, and here's all the beaches, and this is my best beach, and this is where the best fish restaurant is."
So one of the reasons, if we come back to why did I call it Buzzcar? I wanted to remind all of us about the power of the hive, and its incredible facility to create this platform that individuals want to participate and innovate on.
So over the last decade, we've been reveling in the power of the Internet and how it's empowered individuals, and for me, what Peers, Inc. does is it takes it up a notch. We're now bringing the power of the company and the corporation and supercharging individuals.
Sure, it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion, but it's also involved in tons of other processes, like memory, language, attention, even anger, disgust and pain.
If it's an image, they may read it.
And sometimes war is inevitable, sometimes, but maybe [with] effort, we can avoid it.
And I'm just going to take a picture of it, and I'm just going to post it on Facebook with kind of "Israelis for peace" or something.
The most famous early battle was Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson over what the dollar would be and how it would be backed up, with Alexander Hamilton saying, "We need a central bank, the First Bank of the United States, or else the dollar will have no value.
Throughout it all, the dollar has been one of the most long-standing, stable, reasonable currencies, and we all use it every single day, no matter what the people screaming about tell us, no matter how scared we're supposed to be.
Giambattista della Porta, a Neapolitan scholar in the 16th century, examined and studied the natural world and saw how it could be manipulated.
Playing with the world, and our perception of it, really is the essence of visual effects.
It's called breakbone fever, because that's how you can feel.
So the next time you get dengue fever, if it's a different strain, you're more susceptible, you're likely to get worse symptoms, and you're more likely to get the more severe forms, hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome.
So it's not very effective, but it's probably the best thing we've got at the moment.
We are going to use it in and around humans.
It has to be safe.
But whereas a G.M. crop is trying to protect the plant, for example, and give it an advantage, what we're actually doing is taking the mosquito and giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have, rendering it unable to reproduce effectively.
But it is a gross distortion of reality.
It's like put out in the two oceans and it's pulling the whole country apart, pulling left and right into their own territories like the Bloods and the Crips.
It's wonderful to be here to talk about my journey, to talk about the wheelchair and the freedom it has bought me.
In fact, I now call the underwater wheelchair "Portal," because it's literally pushed me through into a new way of being, into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness.
And I sent this book out to a dozen publishers and it was rejected every single time, but I was also involved with the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, an amazing camp for kids with all sorts of critical illnesses, and it's those kids at the camp that read my stories, and I read to them, and I saw that they responded to my work.
Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal.
Maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients.
And the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great.
It's not the only reason preventing heart disease.
What nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels, so it lowers your blood pressure.
It also dilates the coronary arteries, so it stops angina.
So it's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises.
It arises in the skin.
Well, having found that and published that, I thought, well, what's it doing?
It's not the heart. What do you do?
We put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it, we injected things. We couldn't turn off the nitric oxide.
So vitamin D is good for you -- it stops rickets, it prevents calcium metabolism, important stuff.
If your leg is chopped off and you lose blood, your body will clamp down, increase the heart rate, do everything it can to keep your blood pressure up.
And what we've shown is that doing a sham irradiation -- this is the thick line here -- this is shining UV on the arm so it warms up but keeping it covered so the rays don't hit the skin.
And you can look -- So, if you live on the equator, the sun comes straight overhead, it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere.
If you live up here, in summer the sun is coming fairly directly down, but in winter it's coming through a huge amount of atmosphere, and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out, and the range of wavelengths that hit the Earth are different from summer to winter.
We're still working at this story, we're still developing it, we're still expanding it.
We think it's very important.
We think they're then stored in the skin, and we think the sunlight releases this where it has generally beneficial effects.
They dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV, but you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance -- it becomes the kids' own dance.
Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this: "Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything?
Where did you meet it?" "Um, in front of the supermarket."
Writing such an unjustifiable sentence and continuing in order to justify it, Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature.
Work doesn't make you happy, does it? Mostly it's tough.
It's a bit mischievous, actually.
"Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired."
Right? Why would work tire us if it's in our nature?
"Now you'll get it, you rascal!" was the response.  "You'll get it!" he said.
It can be a simple theme: Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.
It saves our souls and makes us live happily.
It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs.
It's boring. Um, who cares, and it sucks."
A virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its DNA into it.
And now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA, the virus DNA takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses.
So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses -- that is, until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts.
But if a textbook seems too much fun, it's somehow unscientific.
Our government didn't design the national lottery, it didn't fund the national lottery, it doesn't operate the national lottery.
It simply passed the National Lottery Act and this is what followed.
It specifies certain benefits that the state can uniquely bestow on the operators.
And it puts some obligations on those operators.
Let's call it national e-markets, NEMs for short.
So it's on a par with the water supply or the road network.
And government has certain benefits it can uniquely bestow on these markets.
In this case, you take a move block, snap it into a stack, and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors of the different characters in your game or your story, in this case controlling the big fish.
It uses the webcam.
But instead of just playing someone else's game, you get to create the games, and if you see someone else's game, you can just say "see inside," and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it.
He took the block and he put it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish.
But unfortunately, it wasn't really fully exploited commercially until after the Second World War.
It changed the face of this country, as you can see today and witness.
You put it in your search engine, and you create the drug to treat the threat.
And one day I was at work and I saw a talk by Stefan Sagmeister on TED, and it was called "The power of time off," and he spoke about how every seven years, he takes a year off from work so he could do his own creative projects, and I was instantly inspired, and I just said, "I have to do that. I have to take a year off.
I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it.
And then the second question was, "Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue?"
To the first question, 63 percent of people said yes, we like it.
Thirty-seven said no, we don't like it.
But to the second question, half of them that didn't like it, they wanted it to continue.  So we noticed change.
The paint on the walls did not feed children, nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant, but it gave hope and light, and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things, a different spirit, a different feel to our lives, and that if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics, we could build a better life for each other and for our country.
We established a green tax, and then everybody accepted it and all businessmen paid it regularly.
So you ask yourself, if education has become so much more expensive, has it become so much better?
So you take a chunk of reality you want to understand and you translate it into mathematics.
You encode it into equations.
The study went viral on the Internet and it attracted a lot of attention from the international media.
And it turns out to be structured as follows.
So you should take the exact numbers in our study with a grain of salt, yet it "gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance."
It would be really great if it has the power to help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas, which appears to be paralyzing our globalized world.
So what sustains desire, and why is it so difficult?
But what they know is they know how to resurrect it.
They know how to bring it back.
And just in summary, no matter how far I push this, I can't get it to break.
So even before a target appears that she's supposed to cross with the cursor that she's controlling with this joystick, Aurora is trying to find the target, no matter where it is.
It's a ceremony. People are enjoying it.
It's practiced, it's no anesthesia, it's a rusty old knife, and it was difficult.
It is going to extend its legs out.
They have two types of flight muscle: so-called power muscle, which is stretch-activated, which means that it activates itself and does not need to be controlled on a contraction-by-contraction basis by the nervous system.
It's specialized to generate the enormous power required for flight, and it fills the middle portion of the fly, so when a fly hits your windshield, it's basically the power muscle that you're looking at.
Watch it very closely, and you'll see why my six-year-old son now wants to be a neuroscientist.
It looks sort of like a fly. It has wings, it has eyes, it has antennae, its legs, complicated life history, it's a parasite, it has to fly around and find caterpillars to parasatize, but not only is its brain the size of a salt grain, which is comparable for a fruit fly, it is the size of a salt grain.
The amazing thing about this is that it's controlled by a really tiny set of neurons, about two dozen neurons that can produce a vast variety of different motor patterns, and the reason it can do this is that this little tiny ganglion in the crab is actually inundated by many, many neuromodulators.
You can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display.
So I really think that, as we learn more, it's going to turn out that the whole fly brain is just like a large version of this stomatogastric ganglion, and that's one of the reasons why it can do so much with so few neurons.
So what is Agile, and why can it help with something that seems so different, like families?
So instead of saying, "You guys go off into that bunker and come back with a cell phone or a social network," you say, "You go off and come up with one element, then bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt."
Tolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.
In fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden.
That story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that I learned: Happiness is not something we find, it's something we make.
It's a matter of choice.
And you can look far back into the past, but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is, it's quite easy to figure out where it came from.
It came from about 300 years ago, and it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet. ["The British Empire"] Imagine trying to run the show, trying to run the entire planet, without computers, without telephones, with data handwritten on pieces of paper, and traveling by ships.
It's still with us today.
It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine.
It's not broken. It's wonderfully constructed.
It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated.
It's just that we don't need it anymore. It's outdated.
It was three feet off the ground, and they said, "What is this?"
I found a village. It was called Kallikuppam in southern India.
It's about letting it happen.
you say, "There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle," and leave him alone. He'll figure it out.
you say, "There's a magic word. It's called the tangent of an angle," and leave him alone. He'll figure it out.
I've tried incredible, incredible questions -- "When did the world begin? How will it end?" — to nine-year-olds.
It will be called the School in the Cloud.
So it is a one-company town.
In fact, there was a poll that was done recently and the pollster compared Congress's approval ratings to a number of other unpleasant things, and it was found, in fact, that Congress's approval rating is worse than cockroaches, lice, Nickelback the band, root canals and Donald Trump.  But wait, the good news is it's at least better than meth labs and gonorrhea.  We got a problem, folks.
Well, maybe it's for you.
And it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies in the first few weeks, and the label considers this a failure.
It has just come through four months of rain, and it's now going into eight months of dry season.
It has just come through four months of rain, and it's now going into eight months of dry season.
We now have in the violent Horn of Africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture.
We are already doing so on about 15 million hectares on five continents, and people who understand far more about carbon than I do calculate that, for illustrative purposes, if we do what I am showing you here, we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years, and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands
So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa, could just be thrown off the back of the ship, attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line, it would just float around passively carried by the currents, and the only light visible to the animals in the deep would be the blue light of the optical lure, which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly, because it was designed to imitate
The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure is not because giant squid eat jellyfish, but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light when it's being chewed on by a predator and its only hope for escape may be to attract the attention of a larger predator that will attack its attacker and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.
It was absolutely breathtaking, and had this animal had its feeding tentacles intact and fully extended, it would have been as tall as a two-story house.
When I was a kid, I hid my heart under the bed, because my mother said, "If you're not careful, someday someone's going to break it."
Don't tell me that hurts less than a broken bone, that an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away, that there's no way for it to metastasize; it does.
To this day, he is a stick of TNT lit from both ends, could describe to you in detail the way the sky bends in the moment before it's about to fall, and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration, he remains a conversation piece between people who can't understand sometimes being drug-free has less to do with addiction and more to do with sanity.
But it always leaves behind that 10 percent or more that is most disadvantaged or unlucky.
But you want to make half a million dollars trying to cure kids of malaria, and you're considered a parasite yourself.  And we think of this as our system of ethics, but what we don't realize is that this system has a powerful side effect, which is: It gives a really stark, mutually exclusive choice between doing very well for yourself and your family or doing good for the world,
But I don't want my donation spent on advertising, I want it go to the needy."
It became this economic sanctuary, where they could do penance for their profit-making tendencies -- at five cents on the dollar.
What if the bake sale only netted 71 dollars for charity because it made no investment in its scale and the professional fundraising enterprise netted 71 million dollars because it did?
These drugs have so many side effects because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder is a bit like trying to change your engine oil by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block.
But can an organism like a fruit fly, which is -- it's a great model organism because it's got a small brain, it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors, it breeds quickly, and it's cheap.
That's right -- flies, like people, have dopamine, and it acts on their brains and on their synapses through the same dopamine receptor molecules that you and I have.
It's bigger.
Suddenly it wasn't here at all.
There was sort of a movie made about it recently.
But it should be be perfect enough, because nature doesn't do perfect either.
Now, re-wilding is moving faster in Korea than it is in America, and so the plan is, with these re-wilded areas all over Europe, they will introduce the aurochs to do its old job, its old ecological role, of clearing the somewhat barren, closed-canopy forest so that it has these biodiverse meadows in it.
Conductive ink has been used by artists, but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens.
It's a website where we, and anyone else who wants to join us, share experiments, publish information, encourage others to contribute whenever they can, and aggregate resources such as research papers and tutorials by other makers like ourselves.
But paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics.
It was incredibly successful.
In fact, it was so successful that there's no way that these days you could make a book like this.
Now, you don't really think that our airplane system depends on the Internet, and in some sense it doesn't.
It didn't think of itself as being on the Internet.
It thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet, but it was possible for somebody to smuggle a USB drive in there, or something like that, and software got in there that causes the centrifuges, in that case, to actually destroy themselves.
So, in other words, it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it.
So of course, the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy, who would send it back in time and get it there super early, so every message in the Internet started getting switched through this one node, and of course that clogged everything up.

One of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on that go through the Internet right now, and so in fact we're becoming dependent on it for more and more different things, like when you take off from LAX, you're really not thinking you're using the Internet.
And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet and saying it can do this, or it does do this, or it will do that, you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather, or something like that.
They have an informed opinion, but it's changing so quickly that even the experts don't know exactly what's going on.
Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now because it's different than it was an hour ago.
It's constantly changing. It's constantly reconfiguring.
So I think that, if people understand how much we're starting to depend on the Internet, and how vulnerable it is, we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist, and I think if enough people say, "Yeah, I would like to use it, I'd like to have such a system," then it will get built.
And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size.
So as a result, the energy usage is very low, and it has the most advanced battery pack, and that's what gives it the range that's competitive, so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range.

EM: It must, actually. If it doesn't, we're in deep trouble.
And the thing about solar power is that it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs, so once it's installed, it's just there.
It works for decades. It'll work for probably a century.
But the big innovation is still ahead, and you're working on it now. Tell us about this.
So now it's hovering at about 40 meters, and it's constantly adjusting the angle, the pitch and yaw of the main engine, and maintaining roll with cold gas thrusters.
Can we put it into our education system? Can someone learn from you?
Is it going to land where it's supposed to?
The bad news is, this drug doesn't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis, and it won't work for Danny, and we're still waiting for that next generation to help him.
Well, one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology, and a very important technology that we depend on for all of this is the human genome, the ability to be able to look at a chromosome, to unzip it, to pull out all the DNA, and to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code, the A's, C's, G's and T's that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things,
The normal cell, if you looked at it under the microscope, would have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell, which is nice and round and smooth in its boundaries and it looks kind of like that.
In an experiment done in cell culture and shown here in a cartoon, if you take that particular compound and you add it to that cell that has progeria, and you watch to see what happened, in just 72 hours, that cell becomes, for all purposes that we can determine, almost like a normal cell.
It was developed for cancer. It was AZT.
It didn't work very well for cancer, but became the first successful antiretroviral, and you can see from the table there are others as well.
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to a test a drug to see if it's effective and safe without having to put patients at risk, because that first time you're never quite sure?
You probably know, if you've been paying attention to some of the science literature that you can now take a skin cell and encourage it to become a liver cell or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us.
It was just extraordinary, and when I came back home I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz, and decided to set it to music, a piece for choir called "Cloudburst," which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment.
So what I've done is, I've adapted "Cloudburst" so that it embraces the latency and the performers sing into the latency instead of trying to be exactly together.
A conscious approach to design, I'm calling it bioinformed design, and I think it's possible.
A conscious approach to design, I'm calling it bioinformed design, and I think it's possible.
You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.
You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.
So if I put this inside this water here, you can see a silver reflective coating around it, and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that's protecting the water from touching the paddle, and it's dry.
So game theory is a branch of, originally, applied mathematics, used mostly in economics and political science, a little bit in biology, that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life and it predicts what people are likely to do and believe others will do in cases where everyone's actions affect everyone else.
It is a very useful concept, but behaviorally, it may not exactly explain what people do the first time they play these types of economic games or in situations in the outside world.
Game theoretically, that should actually make the mismatcher's behavior shift, because what happens is, the mismatcher will think, oh, this guy's going to go for the big reward, and so I'm going to go to the right, make sure he doesn't get it.
Okay, so we have a democracy, no doubt, but it's dependent upon the Lesters and dependent upon the people.
Grab that issue, sit it down in front of you, look straight in its eyes, and tell it there is no Christmas this year.
Grab that issue, sit it down in front of you, look straight in its eyes, and tell it there is no Christmas this year.
Franklin said, "A republic, madam, if you can keep it."
All of us have to act to get it back.
It was made of glass, and this building really helped me to do my job good.
You may know that birds don't understand the concept of glass. They don't see it, so they fly into the windows and get killed.
It's a rare picture because there are 10,000 species of birds and only 300 possess a penis.
I'm going to pass it around.
You can pass it around.
He sees an intruder in his territory, and it's coming all the time and he's there, so there is no end to it.
It's really maneuverable. You have a hand-held remote, so you can pretty easily control acceleration, braking, go in reverse if you like, also have braking.
It suggests that we care about reaching the end, a peak.
It suggests that we care about the fight, about the challenge.
It suggests that there's all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways.
The experimenter looked at it, took the sheet of paper, did not look at it, did not scan it, and simply put it on the pile of pages.
So you take a piece, you just put it on the side.
In the third condition, the experimenter got the sheet of paper, and put it directly into a shredder.
So maybe the first sheet you'd do good work, but then you see nobody is really testing it, so you would do more and more and more.
It turns out it was almost like the shredder.
No, it was somebody else's cake, as if you bought it in the store.
You worked for us, but I'll tell you what, we'll sell it to you.
And we had two types of people: We had the people who built it, and the people who did not build it, and just looked at it as external observers.
Or "I love this origami, and everybody else will love it as well?"
They thought everybody else would love it more as well.
Well in an objective way, the origami now was uglier, it was more difficult.
And this gives us a tangible model of the three-dimensional protein and how it folds and all of the intricacies of the geometry.
So you completely print this part, and it can transform into something else.
It was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house.
And it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud.
And when the game eventually happened about a year later, it was very different than the "Jeopardy" games I'd been used to.
Now when facts come in handy like that -- I love that story because it shows you the power of one fact, one remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time -- normally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life.
But in this case it happened in real life.
And it happens in real life all the time.
It's not always a tsunami, often it's a social situation.
And on the other hand, we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia where the machines have taken over and we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore, that knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud, and why would we ever bother learning anything new.
It is the result of high intention, sincere effort and intelligent execution.
It represents the wisest option among many alternatives."
Now the problem with this model is that it's unsustainable globally.
It's unaffordable globally.
So what does this personal health system look like, and what new technologies and roles is it going to entail?
It can plug into a smartphone. It can plug into a tablet.
Harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains.
To go back to that toilet, it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet, it wasn't as nice as this one from the World Toilet Organization.
It gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases.
It's a wonderful waste disposal device.
But I think that it's so good — it doesn't smell, we can put it in our house, we can lock it behind a door — and I think we've locked it out of conversation too.
But I think that it's so good — it doesn't smell, we can put it in our house, we can lock it behind a door — and I think we've locked it out of conversation too.
And I think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development, because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us.
They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it.
They tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it.
Another version of this, another village in India near where Priyanka lives is this village, called Lakara, and about a year ago, it had no toilets whatsoever.
All we really need to do is look at this issue as the urgent, shameful issue that it is.
It depends, of course, on what scale or what scope you want to think about, but this is an organ of surreal complexity, and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it, whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections.
You could, if you want, compare this to, on the one hand, a myocardial infarction, a heart attack, where you have dead tissue in the heart, versus an arrhythmia, where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it.
I'd been told that in an Arab town, one need only mention the name of a local and it will be recognized.
But most of all, I wished to tell him what Herman Melville wrote, that "truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast."
It's been around for about 7,000 years.
Once you choose the right station, whether it be jazz or opera, in our case whether it be movement or mood, we can put the dial there, and then we can use a second button to adjust the volume, to turn it up or turn it down.
It uses 20 percent of all your -- even though it only weighs two percent -- it uses 10 times more glucose than it should based on its weight.
Speech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic.
It's much less reflective -- very different from writing.
What texting is, despite the fact that it involves the brute mechanics of something that we call writing, is fingered speech. That's what texting is.
And it's a very interesting thing, but nevertheless easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline.
It's a way of using the language between actual people.
I can make the curved line end anywhere I wanted, but I decided I would end it at 0.2, just like the U.K. growth for the first four centuries.
Of course, when the motor vehicle was invented, and it became almost ubiquitous by 1929, that agricultural land could be used for human consumption or for export.
As we'll see in a moment, productivity is actually doing all right, but it has become decoupled from jobs, and the income of the typical worker is stagnating.
So maybe "history doesn't repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes."
Today, productivity is at an all-time high, and despite the Great Recession, it grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s, the roaring 1990s, and that was faster than the '70s or '80s.
It's growing faster than it did during the Second Industrial Revolution.
Technology is racing ahead, but it's leaving more and more people behind.
Today, we can take a routine job, codify it in a set of machine-readable instructions, and then replicate it a million times.
Neither is a human, because Kasparov organized a freestyle tournament where teams of humans and computers could work together, and the winning team had no grandmaster, and it had no supercomputer.
The Environmental Protection Agency even classified this group as a top-priority pollutant because it's been shown to cause cancer and birth defects by acting as a hormone disruptor.
I know some of you in the crowd are thinking, well, carbon dioxide is horrible, it's a greenhouse gas.
I felt the ABS kick in, and the car is still going, and it's not going to stop, and I know it's not going to stop, and the air bag deploys, the car is totaled, and fortunately, no one was hurt.
Sitting is so incredibly prevalent, we don't even question how much we're doing it, and because everyone else is doing it, it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay.
Well, uranium dioxide's a ceramic, and ceramic doesn't like releasing what's inside of it.
And it's an amazing technology because not only does it combat climate change, but it's an innovation.
The energy that I'm able to talk to you today, while it was converted to chemical energy in my food, originally came from a nuclear reaction, and so there's something poetic about, in my opinion, perfecting nuclear fission and using it as a future source of innovative energy.
But it is not impossible.
When we received the land, it was less than half a percent rainforest, as in all my region.
[Company sold to Facebook, June 18, 2012...] There are other companies that will place a camera like this — this has nothing to do with Facebook — they take your picture, they tie it to the social media, they figure out you really like to wear black dresses, so maybe the person in the store comes up and says, "Hey, we've got five black dresses that would just look great on you."
Remember? He did a horrible thing, condemned for all time to roll this rock up, it would roll back down, roll back up, roll back down.
And it went on for decades.
It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them.
So who came up with this idea? Who owns it?
That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over.
It's a real achievement to put that particular ability out, or to stifle it.
You know, but it doesn't listen to Radiohead, does it?
Right beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility waiting for the right conditions to come about, and with organic systems, if the conditions are right, life is inevitable. It happens all the time.
It's not fair to students, and it's putting America's global leadership at risk.
It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education, find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding, and have a chance to live out their dreams.
And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body, it would connect two little pieces of copper tape, and it would make a sound, and the next sound, and it would loop the same sounds over and over again.
And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it to the left arrow, I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up, now I have a left arrow and a right arrow, so I should be able to go forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards. Awesome.
I always add humans to any technical -- if you're drawing a technical diagram, put a human in it.
And I also put this little surprise. When you open the lid of the box, it says, "The world is a construction kit."
It starts with a plan.
Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot, but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it.
That's why we put the display up high, out of your line of sight, so it wouldn't be where you're looking and it wouldn't be where you're making eye contact with people.
It's important because it combines both the heart and the head.
it matters just as much to all of these people.
Just as he gets there, the effort becomes too much, the boulder escapes, rolls all the way down the hill, he has to trudge back down to push it up again, and the same thing happens again and again for all eternity.
Or what if instead of making art to display, I had to destroy it?
It was destroyed before it ever existed.
And thirdly, we need to remember that, from a strictly economic point of view, design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly -- mostly it's done by amateurs.
And it goes together without any bolts.
Or, when you're designing a piece, make sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round, or, if you do, it doesn't matter, because it's symmetrical.
Or, when you're designing a piece, make sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round, or, if you do, it doesn't matter, because it's symmetrical.
If we're talking about the 21st-century city, these are the guys who are going to be making it.
Now, with my last piece, I'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun, exciting, and that it can rock you.
Just play your life with all you have, and share it with the world.
And then, again, as climate changed as it always does, and new habitats opened up, we had the arrival of a steppe-adapted species called trogontherii in Central Asia pushing meridionalis out into Western Europe.
Well, the mammoth genome is almost at full completion, and we know that it's actually really big. It's mammoth.
I want people to understand that design is so much more than cute chairs, that it is first and foremost everything that is around us in our life.
It looks at the territory of the United States as if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds and that is really giving you a pictorial image of what's going on with the winds in the United States.
We were talking about the rapture? It's coming.
We were talking about dancing ponies, but I was really jealous of the Walker Arts Center for putting up this festival, because it's very, very wonderful.
And you know, the amount of work -- yeah, Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government and that's how he developed Tetris, and Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube that makes it look slightly bombed.
It was amazing to see. And it's a beautiful game.
Design is truly everywhere, and design is as important as anything, and I'm so glad that, because of its diversity and because of its centrality to our lives, many more people are coming to it as a profession, as a passion, and as, very simply, part of their own culture.
That whole range of issues that I'll refer to in shorthand as "gender violence issues," they've been seen as women's issues that some good men help out with, but I have a problem with that frame and I don't accept it.
This is also true, by the way, of the word "gender," because a lot of people hear the word "gender" and they think it means "women."
A lot of people, when they hear the word "sexual orientation" think it means gay, lesbian, bisexual.
And a lot of people, when they hear the word "gender," think it means women. In each case, the dominant group doesn't get paid attention to.
They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it.
My kind of journalism might not fit in other continents or other countries, but I can tell you, it works in my part of the continent of Africa, because usually, when people talk about corruption, they ask, "Where is the evidence?
Now, the signature whistle is a whistle that's specific to an individual dolphin, and it's like a name.  And this is the best-studied sound, because it's easy to measure, really, and you'd find this whistle when mothers and calves are reuniting, for example.
Here they come, and then they're going to pick up the rope and drag it around as a toy.
So we joined forces with Georgia Tech, with Thad Starner's wearable computing group, to build us an underwater wearable computer that we're calling CHAT. [CHAT: Cetacean Hearing And Telemetry] Now, instead of pushing a keyboard through the water, the diver's wearing the complete system, and it's acoustic only, so basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad on the forearm, the sounds go out through an underwater speaker, if a dolphin mimics the whistle
Which brings up a critical question: Why is this time different, if it really is?
The reason it's different is that, just in the past few years, our machines have started demonstrating skills they have never, ever had before: understanding, speaking, hearing, seeing, answering, writing, and they're still acquiring new skills.
They're actually both proof of how right Voltaire was when he talked about the benefits of work, and the fact that it saves us from not one but three great evils.
I was a Montessori kid for the first few years of my education, and what that education taught me is that the world is an interesting place and my job is to go explore it.
No one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before because it's expensive, it's set in the future, and it's got tons of visual effects, and it's shot on green screen.
So this is what happened on this movie, and that's how it got made, and we went to this very nice postproduction company in Montreal called Vision Globale, and they lent their 60 artists to work full time for six months to do this crazy film.
It's sexist. It's heterosexist.
It's competitive. It's goal-directed.
And it can't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults.
And it's based on pizza.
And because it's an internal desire, we actually have some sense of control over that.
Not everybody can play baseball. It's pretty exclusive.
So what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education?
It's going to come bring it over here and put it down.
So a person that's interacting with the robot understands where it's going to reach and isn't surprised by its motions.
Here Chris took the object out of its hand, and Baxter didn't go and try to put it down; it went back and realized it had to get another one.
It just moves it around, and the robot figures out that was an area search.
It just moves it around, and the robot figures out that was an area search.
One hour after she saw her first industrial robot, she had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory.
And it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand.
Notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top, which means that it can be located in the space.
Here, you see that it's stable, and even if I give it little nudges, it goes back -- to the nice, balanced position.
Here, you see that it's stable, and even if I give it little nudges, it goes back -- to the nice, balanced position.
It naturally doesn't spill, no matter what the quad does.
Suppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip and finish off at the exact same spot that it started.
We then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball so that it flies to where it was thrown from.
It can recognize what my various body parts are doing in real time.
Interaction doesn't have to be virtual. It can be physical.
It's trying to stay at a fixed point in space.
If I try to move it out of the way, it fights me, and moves back to where it wants to be.
If I try to move it out of the way, it fights me, and moves back to where it wants to be.
Here, the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid.
A sergeant comes up to me with a machine gun, puts it to my head, and says, "Tell me where your father is or I will kill you."
And we need it now, before there's a devastating attack or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world to rush to adopt these weapons before thinking through the consequences.
And to my surprise, it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day.
I didn't break a law, and I kept my abaya — it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house — and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off, but I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying, "No, I'm leaving today."
It strips it away of its strongest weapon: fear.
And it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law, or the religious laws.
The way they called it: a betrayal to the Saudi country and the Saudi people, and they even started a hashtag called #OsloTraitor on Twitter.
20 percent of the Council.  The same time, finally, that Council, after rejecting our petition four times for women driving, they finally accepted it last February.
So how can we be so collectively wrong by misreading or ignoring the science of the fact that when an instability has developed, and the system is ripe, any perturbation makes it essentially impossible to control?
We don't release the report. It's kept secret.
It can improve health and it can play a part in reducing, if not eliminating, poverty.
And he came out and, within a day, it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground, the wind-driven dust -- so he suggested making mounds to catch the dust before it went into the house area and affected the eyes of kids.
It was choking with smoke.
And we were able to grow this software footprint, and a few years later it became very useful software, and we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti where citizens could indicate where they are and what their needs were, and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis and the tsunami in Japan.
You have to make it yourself.
In North Korea, I made it myself.
Too human for some, like conservative Muslim theologians who maintain that the account of his wanting to kill himself shouldn't even be mentioned, despite the fact that it's in the earliest Islamic biographies.
It goes hand in hand with doubt, in a never-ending conversation with it, and sometimes in conscious defiance of it.
He'd call out terrorism for what it is, not only criminal but an obscene travesty of everything he believed in and struggled for.
They're hugely dedicated to the institutions that they work for, and the reason that they speak up, the reason they insist on seeing, is because they care so much about the institution and want to keep it healthy.
But freedom doesn't exist if you don't use it, and what whistleblowers do, and what people like Gayla Benefield do is they use the freedom that they have.
I sat in a diner, and I watched as trucks drove up and down the highway, carting away the earth out of gardens and replacing it with fresh, uncontaminated soil.
She had freedom, and she was ready to use it."
In fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem, the tip of a proverbial iceberg?
I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign, but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils.
And because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells, it's probably the safest place to store it.
Most of them actually want to do the right thing, but they have to know what that is, and it's got to work.
Right? You thought it was funny.
Generally, about 85 percent of the people liked it.
A hundred and nine voted it a 10, the highest. Ten voted it one.
It'll go on and produce a tadpole and then a frog.
But it's not related to any of those. It's a marsupial.
It raised its young in a pouch, like a koala or a kangaroo would do, and it has a long history, a long, fascinating history, that goes back 25 million years.
It makes me very sad because, while it's a fascinating animal, and it's amazing to think that we had the technology to film it before it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction, we didn't, unfortunately, at this same time, have a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species.
It makes me very sad because, while it's a fascinating animal, and it's amazing to think that we had the technology to film it before it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction, we didn't, unfortunately, at this same time, have a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species.
The guy who had found it and killed the mother had pickled the pup, and they pickled it in alcohol.
It is, shortly, going to think it's got the ugliest Tasmanian devil baby in the world, so maybe it'll need some help to keep it going.
They took some of this same pickled thylacine DNA and they spliced it into a mouse genome, but they put a tag on it so that anything that this thylacine DNA produced would appear blue-green in the mouse baby.
When the baby popped up, it was filled with blue-green tissues.
Does it have to stay in a laboratory, or could we put it back where it belongs?
Could we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in Tasmania, restore that ecosystem?
It became part of us, and we believed in it.
The good belongs to those who are democracies and are charged with a mission of spreading it around the globe, sometimes by force, against the evil of those who do not hold elections.
It won't last long because it cannot adapt.
So if election is the panacea for corruption, how come these countries can't fix it?
The significance of China's example is not that it provides an alternative, but the demonstration that alternatives exist.
It's not exactly right, but I think it comes close.
But what we found, of course, since it's already on a computer, we can deliver instant maps and analysis and graphing.
In the second three years, we had 14,000 people find the website, sign up and start using it to collect data: data for disaster response, Canadian pig farmers tracking pig disease and pig herds, people tracking drug supplies.
When the wind passes, rises to pass over the mountain, it can take on a wave-like path in the lee of the peak, with these clouds hovering at the crest of these invisible standing waves of air, these flying saucer-like forms, and some of the early black-and-white UFO photos are in fact lenticularis clouds. It's true.
And it reminds us of the aimless nature of cloudspotting, what an aimless activity it is.
It's pointless. It's a pointless activity, which is precisely why it's so important.
This next song is an original we wrote called "Timelapse," and it will probably live up to its name.
A plant, quite simply, needs light, it needs CO2, but even more importantly, it needs nutrients, which it draws from the soil.
It is extremely important, and once again, phosphorus is a key player.
As humans, where do we find it?
Basically, we get it out of mines.
It has led me to further my research and to use it as a model for my laboratory research.
It will go in search of phosphorus, but only within the one millimeter which surrounds it.
It will go in search of phosphorus, but only within the one millimeter which surrounds it.
It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus.
And over time, this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out even the tiniest trace of phosphorus, and to put it to use, to make it available to the plant.
It will proliferate between the root's cells, eventually penetrating a cell and starting to form a typical arbuscular structure, which will considerably increase the exchange interface between the plant and the mushroom.
The mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form and making it available for the plant to use.
So we sent an undercover investigator in to secretly film meetings with members of the ruling elite, and the resulting footage, well, it made some people very angry, and you can see that on YouTube, but it proved what we had long suspected, because it showed how the state's chief minister, despite his later denials, used his control over land and forest licenses to enrich himself and his family.
It found that over 70 percent of those cases had used anonymous shell companies, totaling almost 56 billion dollars.
Now many of these companies were in America or the United Kingdom, its overseas territories and Crown dependencies, and so it's not just an offshore problem, it's an on-shore one too.
But literally hundreds of civil society groups from around the world came together to fight for transparency, and now it's fast becoming the norm and the law.
My little boy reminded me that for all the technology and all the toys in the world, sometimes just a small block of wood, if you stack it up tall, actually is an incredibly inspiring thing.
And although a lot of that is about energy, it's also so much about carbon.
When a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen and soaks up carbon dioxide, and it dies and it falls to the forest floor, it gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground.
If it burns in a forest fire, it's going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well.
But if you take that wood and you put it into a building or into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy, it actually has an amazing capacity to store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration.
But to build a fire, you kind of start with small pieces of wood and you work your way up, and eventually you can add the log to the fire, and when you do add the log to the fire, of course, it burns, but it burns slowly.
These are big brains, highly social animals, and I thought, well, if we give them choice and control, if they can hit a symbol on this keyboard -- and by the way, it was interfaced by fiber optic cables from Hewlett-Packard with an Apple II computer.
They explored the keyboard. They played around with it.
They figured out how it worked.
At first they did what infants do, just bashed it with their fists, and then I asked, through Sue, if Panbanisha could try with one finger only.
Thirty years ago, we turned it on.
And the name of the protein I'd located was called mesothelin, and it's just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill type protein, unless, of course, you have pancreatic, ovarian or lung cancer, in which case it's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream.
But also, the key is that it's found in the earliest stages of the disease, when someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival.
You start with some water, pour in some nanotubes, add antibodies, mix it up, take some paper, dip it, dry it, and you can detect cancer.
One of the best parts of the sensor, though, is that it has close to 100 percent accuracy, and can detect the cancer in the earliest stages, when someone has close to 100 percent chance of survival.
Yeah, but watch. When it didn't find anything to eat --   I think that's an expression that can be understood in any language.
At the end of its breeding cycle, the Great Basin Spadefoot toad digs itself down about a meter under the hard-panned desert soil of the American West, where it can stay for many seasons until conditions are just right for it to emerge again.
It's the place where you become yourself.
And I began to think that really, movement was only as good as the sense of stillness that you could bring to it to put it into perspective.
And I began to think that really, movement was only as good as the sense of stillness that you could bring to it to put it into perspective.
It was really a presence of a kind of energy or quickening.
It's the place where you stand.
After fixing, breaking, redesigning, mending, bending and amending, my ideal bow began to take shape, and when it was finally done, it looked like this.
This shift is the most striking in the U.S. and in the U.K., but it's a global phenomenon.
And why stop at just playing the global political and economic system as it exists to your own maximum advantage?
For all that it is raising hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the emerging markets, it's also outsourcing a lot of jobs from the developed Western economies.
So I bought one of those little kits that you could get to make a radio transmitter, and I got an old book and I carved out the inside and I hid it inside there, and then I placed it next to my dad and snuck back to my bedroom and tuned in on the radio so I could eavesdrop.
It was in far western New South Wales.
And this one, it's a large poster, and you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it, and the poster talks to you when you touch it and asks you a series of questions, and it works out your perfect cake.
And this one, it's a large poster, and you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it, and the poster talks to you when you touch it and asks you a series of questions, and it works out your perfect cake.
But it doesn't tell you the cake there and then.
It uploads a picture, and the reason why it chose that cake for you, to our Facebook page and to Twitter.
This poster is wirelessly connected to my cell phone, and when you touch it, it connects to the app.
This poster is wirelessly connected to my cell phone, and when you touch it, it connects to the app.
And it has really good response time.
It's using Bluetooth 4, so it's pretty instantaneous.
Well, it's a curiously neglected subject, both in our scientific and our philosophical culture.
Well, it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple, logical reason, namely, it's a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we're conscious.
When I first got interested in this, I thought, well, it's a straightforward problem in biology.
It's a part of the spiritual world.
It belongs to the soul, and the soul is not a part of the physical world.
Either it doesn't exist at all, or it's something else, a computer program or some damn fool thing, but in any case it's not part of science.
It's an illusion, like sunsets.
Two: Well, maybe it exists, but it's really something else.
And four: Maybe consciousness exists, but it can't make any difference to the world.
I think it's rather easy to define if you're not trying to give a scientific definition.
It begins in the morning when you wake up from a dreamless sleep, and it goes on all day until you fall asleep or die or otherwise become unconscious.
Well, the first feature is, it's real and irreducible.
You can't get rid of it.
You cannot get rid of it by showing that it's an illusion in a way that you can with other standard illusions.
Okay, the next feature of consciousness, after this marvelous unified conscious field, is that it functions causally in our behavior.
Sorry to use philosophical terminology here, but when it's secreted at the axon end-plates of the motor neurons, a whole lot of wonderful things happen in the ion channels and the damned arm goes up.
Well, the first one I said was, consciousness doesn't exist, it's an illusion. Well, I've already answered that.
But the second one had an incredible influence, and may still be around, and that is, "Well, if consciousness exists, it's really something else.
Yeah, forget about the hardware. Any hardware will do provided it's rich enough and stable enough to carry the program."
It's got a content in addition to the syntax.
It's got a semantics.
It creates a reality of money, property, government, marriage, CERN conferences, cocktail parties and summer vacations, and all of those are creations of consciousness.
I said that behaviorism ought to be one of the great embarrassments of our intellectual culture, because it's refuted the moment you think about it.
So what's starting to happen, if you think about money, if you sort of boil money down to an essence, it is literally just an expression of value, an agreed value.
So if you think we're starting to question and disrupt and interrogate what money means, what our relationship with it is, what defines money, then the ultimate extension of that is, is there a reason for the government to be in charge of money anymore?
We only can create a vision of the future, how it might be, a vision which reveals disruptive ideas, which is inspiring, and this is the most important reason which breaks the chains of common thinking.
It will be more like a living organism than just a collection of very complex technology.
It will communicate directly with the passenger in its environment.
So nature is very clever. It puts all the information into these small building blocks, which we call DNA.
I was leaving a seminar when it started, humming to myself, fumbling with my bag just as I'd done a hundred times before, when suddenly I heard a voice calmly observe, "She is leaving the room."
It was neutral, impassive and even, after a while, strangely companionate and reassuring, although I did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion.
Otherwise, it was neither sinister nor disturbing, although even at that point it was clear that it had something to communicate to me about my emotions, particularly emotions which were remote and inaccessible.
But having been encouraged to see the voice not as an experience but as a symptom, my fear and resistance towards it intensified.
Well, you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students."
The voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it, and possibly one of the greatest revelations was when I realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly, and as such, it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care.
This type of society is not only possible, it's already on its way.
To paraphrase Chavez, once social change begins, it cannot be reversed.
The next moment, as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows, a young man with a propane lantern came on, hung it up on a tree, set up a curtain.
If I were to reduce this entire story into one image, what would it be?"
It's a movie. I did "The Tempest" on a stage three times in the theater since 1984, '86, and I love the play.
I did it always with a male Prospero.
So I went from theater, doing "The Tempest" on the stage in a very low-budget production many years ago, and I love the play, and I also think it's Shakespeare's last play, and it really lends itself, as you can see, to cinema.
But I'm just going to give you a little example about how one stages it in theater and then how one takes that same idea or story and moves it into cinema.
And as she was there on the edge of that stage, two stagehands all in black with watering cans ran along the top and started to pour water on the sand castle, and the sand castle started to drip and sink, but before it did, the audience saw the black-clad stagehands.
The medium was apparent. It was banal. We saw it.
The medium was apparent. It was banal. We saw it.
To my right is sheer shale. It's coming off.
We make a new car every year, and then we spend the rest of the season trying to understand what it is we've built to make it better, to make it faster.
We're always trying to make it faster.
On the race car in front of you here there are about 120 sensors when it goes into a race.
We have an approach which, if it's successful, there's no reason why it should stay within a hospital.
And meanwhile, we'll take our little three-month-old baby, keep taking it to the track, keeping it safe, and making it faster and better.
It's not a language for science, research, a language we're used to in universities, a language we use in the workplace, a language we rely on if we were to perform an advanced research project, and it definitely isn't a language we use at the airport.
Where can I use it, then? We could all ask this question!
They make it sacred.
That's why they use it in production, they pay a lot of money to develop it.
That's why they use it in production, they pay a lot of money to develop it.
They kept it close to them.
Because if you get any product from Turkey or elsewhere and it's not labeled in Turkish, then it isn't a local product.
You wouldn't believe it's a local product.
It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one.
We've made a system which is basically a live production machine, a real-time music production machine, and it enables me to, using nothing but my voice, create music in real time as I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me.
So once this thing really gets going, and it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it, it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice, but it is, so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple.
So once this thing really gets going, and it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it, it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice, but it is, so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple.
It is possible, and you can do it very simply using this machine. It's really fantastic. Check it out.
Here's my argument. Does it work? Is it any good?
It's just taken up habitation in our mind, and there's no magic bullet that's going to kill it.
It's just taken up habitation in our mind, and there's no magic bullet that's going to kill it.
There's no magic wand that's going to make it disappear.
It uses something called the dwarf sunflower, which grows to about 12 inches in height.
Here I'll quote one of my students who said, "Sex is so good, it's good even when it's bad."
It's called Sankofa.
But Derek, your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it, bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break.
But Derek, your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it, bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break.
In fact, the first time, Derek, you played that with an orchestra, you'd learned the version that you'd learned, and then the orchestra, in fact, did have a different version, so while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert, Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the orchestra.
It's a very popular museum now, and I created a big monument for the government.
It was meant to stay there for three years, but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.
It was meant to stay there for three years, but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it.
It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now.
Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it.
Now, there is a sound --  Ah, it worked!
We throw it away.
We've treated it as an enemy.
This is donated by a social scientist, and they said they didn't know what it was or indeed, how to use it, so --  Sorry.
This is donated by a social scientist, and they said they didn't know what it was or indeed, how to use it, so --  Sorry.
So I borrowed it. I don't think they noticed. OK.
We've said that sleep is complicated and it takes 32 years of our life.
In fact, it's been estimated to give us a threefold advantage.
It's not some sort of thing that we can take on board rather casually.
It's locked onto the same light-dark cycle as the rest of us.
It can actually ease the sleep transition.
So it actually harms some of the neural processing that's going on during memory consolidation and memory recall.
So it's a short-term acute measure, but for goodness sake, don't become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night.
Well, sleep loss seems to give rise to the release of the hormone ghrelin, Ghrelin is released. It gets to the brain.
The brain says, "I need carbohydrates," and what it does is seek out carbohydrates and particularly sugars.
The first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can, and also make it slightly cool. Very important.
The first critical thing is make it as dark as you possibly can, and also make it slightly cool. Very important.
And anyone who's been bitten by the numbers bug knows that it bites early and it bites deep.
I explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful.
It is in telling the story of the mathematics.
If you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file, that's 22 meg.
This number is 17 and a half thousand slides long, and we know it is prime as confidently as we know the number seven is prime.
People thought it might have been an interview I'd done on my show.
I've clearly got mass. Where does it come from?
We thought it might be there, and we went and found it.
That was a turning point for the marathon, where people started looking at it as a platform for peace and unity.
It gained credibility from both the Lebanese and the international community.
XL: When you zoom in into the hippocampus, of course you will see lots of cells, but we are able to find which cells are involved in a particular memory, because whenever a cell is active, like when it's forming a memory, it will also leave a footprint that will later allow us to know these cells are recently active.
It should act at the speed of the brain, in milliseconds.
Whenever a mouse is in fear, it will show this very typical behavior by staying at one corner of the box, trying to not move any part of its body, and this posture is called freezing.
So if a mouse remembers that something bad happened in this box, and when we put them back into the same box, it will basically show freezing because it doesn't want to be detected by any potential threats in this box.
XL: However, if you put the mouse in a completely different new box, like the next one, it will not be afraid of this box because there's no reason that it will be afraid of this new environment.
When we first put the mouse into this box, it's exploring, sniffing around, walking around, minding its own business, because actually by nature, mice are pretty curious animals.
It stayed here and tried not to move any part of its body.
Now I happen to completely agree with the optimism of this first quote, because on a scale of zero to Morgan Freeman's voice, it happens to be one of the most evocative accolades that I've heard come our way.
But as you'll see, it's not the only opinion that's out there.
So what would happen here if, while the animal is recalling the memory of the blue box, we gave it a couple of mild foot shocks?
And yes, it's an acrylic painting of a man, but I didn't paint it on canvas.
And yes, it's an acrylic painting of a man, but I didn't paint it on canvas.
I painted it directly on top of the man.
What I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether, and if I want to paint your portrait, I'm painting it on you, physically on you.
I was fascinated with the absence of light, and I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality and pin it down before it changed.
I was fascinated with the absence of light, and I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality and pin it down before it changed.
I couldn't have foreseen that when I wanted to paint a shadow, I would pull out this whole other dimension, that I would collapse it, that I would take a painting and make it my friend and then bring him back to a painting.
It was about space and light.
We got a pool. We filled it with milk.
We filled it with Sheila. And I began painting.
It's a stress hormone.
It also acts on your body, and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress.
It's a natural anti-inflammatory.
It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress.
And as soon as I found that word, I realized that I wanted to devote much of the rest of my life to it.
The other thing that whales do is that, as they're plunging up and down through the water column, they're kicking the phytoplankton back up towards the surface where it can continue to survive and reproduce.
It means taking down the fences, it means blocking the drainage ditches, it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea, but otherwise stepping back.
It lets nature decide, and nature, by and large, is pretty good at deciding.
And Gallery One is an interesting project because it started with this massive, $350 million expansion for the Cleveland Museum of Art, and we actually brought in this piece specifically to grow new capacity, new audiences, at the same time that the museum itself is growing.
And so what we're doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries, so you can still have a traditional gallery experience, but if you're interested, you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it's from, or manipulate the work itself.
So, for example, you can click on this individual lion head, and this is where it originated from, 1300 B.C.
So it's estimated that a third of the world watched 9/11 live, and a third of the world heard about it within 24 hours, making it really by nature of when it happened, this unprecedented moment of global awareness.
And I'll just play you part of a mockup of it, but you get a sense of what it's like to actually enter into that moment in time and be transported back in history.
Voice 2: It's something that we shared, and it's something that united us.
I could have family and friends read me material, and I could then read it back as many times as I needed.
In 1987, in the month our eldest son Gerard was born, I got my first blind computer, and it's actually here.
See it up there?
And you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen.
Don't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time.  I think there's more memory in my watch.
It was invented by Russell Smith, a passionate inventor in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people.
It had a speech synthesizer.
But it goes further.
It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics.
And it's got a comments section here where we can submit comments to the website.
This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software, and it will go through and it will scan the system, have a look at what its popping up here.
This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software, and it will go through and it will scan the system, have a look at what its popping up here.
It creates some very serious alerts.
But attention is what steers your perceptions, it's what controls your reality. It's the gateway to the mind.
Now, instead of doing it like misdirection and throwing it off to the side, instead, what I choose to focus on is Frank, to be able to play with the Frank inside your head, your security guard, and get you, instead of focusing on your external senses, just to go internal for a second.
Hold your hand out flat. Open it up.
Put your hand up a little bit higher, but watch it close.
Looks a lot like the watch I was wearing, doesn't it?
If we watch this kind of close, it looks like it goes away.
It's not back on your shoulder.
It falls out of the air, lands right back in the hand.
Did you see it go?
If I do it slowly it goes straight away, it lands by your pocket.
Is it in this pocket, sir?
So we'd love to give you this lovely watch as a gift.  Hopefully it matches his taste.
Like I said, it shapes your reality.
Now this one's the tomato tickler.  Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the flower, the anther, and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.
So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it, and they do this by shaking their flight muscles at a frequency similar to the musical note C.
We've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies for human medicine, but we didn't know how good it was for the bees.
I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it, and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus, but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu, and I know how difficult it is for me to get to the grocery store to get good nutrition.
It has mathematical structure, and we can use that mathematical structure to go and explore things like the world of ideas to see what's being said, to see what's not being said, and to be a little bit more human and, hopefully, a little smarter.
I emphasize leather because it is so widely used.
It is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history.
It mainly uses one cell type, and it is largely two-dimensional.
It is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators.
It's natural connective tissue.
It's the extracellular matrix, but in leather, it's the main building block.
It is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow or an alligator.
This piece of leather is a mere seven tissue layers thick, and as you can see, it is nearly transparent.
He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.
In another study, we showed a simulated accident where a car went through an intersection with a stop sign, and if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign, many witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign at the intersection, not a stop sign.
And I went through nearly five years of dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation, but finally, finally, it was over and I could really get back to my work.
Does it affect your later thoughts, your later behaviors?
Science, we generally are told, is a very well-ordered mechanism for understanding the world, for gaining facts, for gaining data, that it's rule-based, that scientists use this thing called the scientific method and we've been doing this for 14 generations or so now, and the scientific method is a set of rules for getting hard, cold facts out of the data.
You can find all sorts of information there. It's wide open.
There it is, the visual system.
We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confront a very complex world, and it's a world where we've had to develop new mental habits, new habits of mind.
They wanted to break it up into little bits that they could use.
Now you see again, this person has rejected going beyond the concrete world and analyzing it through everyday experience, and it was important to that person what color bears were -- that is, they had to hunt bears.
And you were supposed to think, well, the state legislature was rural-controlled, and they hated the big city, so rather than putting the capital in a big city, they put it in a county seat.
It's the stigma. So you hold it in and you hide it, and you hold it in and you hide it, and even though it's keeping you in bed every day and it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it, you hide it, because the stigma in our society around depression is very real.
I wish I did, but I don't -- but I think, I think it has to start here.
It has to start with me, it has to start with you, it has to start with the people who are suffering, the ones who are hidden in the shadows.
And know that you're sick, you're not weak, and it's an issue, not an identity, because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others, you can see depression for what it really is, and that's just a part of life, just a part of life, and as much as I hate, as much as I hate some of the places, some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to,
And the reason the story obsessed me is that I thought I understood it, and then I went back over it and I realized that I didn't understand it at all.
And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it, and they put a projectile, either a rock or a lead ball, inside the pouch, and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go, and the effect is to send the projectile forward towards its target.
When David rolls it around like this, he's turning the sling around probably at six or seven revolutions per second, and that means that when the rock is released, it's going forward really fast, probably 35 meters per second.
The pituitary tumor, as it grows, often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain, with the result that people with acromegaly have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted.
So even as we share death as a universal experience, it's not experienced the same way the world over.
It ritualizes the impact of death on families and communities.
It's a moment when people think about who they are, their place in society, and their role in the life cycle in accordance with Torajan cosmology.
What would it be like to look on the expired human form with love because it's so intimately a part of who we all are?
And most importantly, true love will find you when you least expect it."
I'm going to shove it into my bag, I'm going to have this email template, and I'm going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically, these dates really are terrible.
Now as you may know, sound travels in waves, so if you have a speaker, a speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal, transform it into a vibration, which is then transported through the air, is captured by our ear, and transformed into an audio signal again.
So we had this speaker set up, and we had the camera facing it, and lots of lights pointing at the speaker, and I would set up the speaker, put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker, and we would do this over and over again, and it was until midday that I realized that I had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker.
So if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field, it would change its appearance.
It's got nothing in it.
And now I'm going to fill it with oxygen and whiskey.
So the images that you saw at the beginning, they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle, and you have to imagine it was flipped around 180 degrees.
Will they have learned that reading is a chore, a form of piecework to be done for pay, that's the worry, or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake?
Democracy does not require perfect equality, but what it does require is that citizens share in a common life.
If business pollutes, it makes more money than if it tried to reduce that pollution.
It involves the design of cities and the design of city streets.
So if it worked better for traffic, if it was better for mobility, if it was safer, better for business, we would keep it, and if it didn't work, no harm, no foul, we could put it back the way that it was, because these were temporary materials.
This is how it looked in 2013 after we built out 350 miles of on-street bike lanes.
It's diverse -- young, old, black, white, women, kids, all getting on a bike.
You make it with your enemies."
We who had worked in behavior knew that punishment was something that was discussed but also that it was highly overvalued.
I put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by China that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow, because they believe increasingly that it is the system in living standards in the shortest period of time.
It's the model that put food on the table.
It's the refrigerators.
It put a man on the moon.
Ultimately, it's about transforming the world and making it a better place.
What happens when a city decides it's going to set other priorities?
So if they're not spending that money on driving -- and by the way, 85 percent of the money we spend on driving leaves the local economy -- if they're not spending that money on driving, what are they spending it on?
Because if your city is designed around cars, it's really good at smashing them into each other.
If you love nature, the best thing you can do is stay the heck away from it, move to a city, and the denser the better, and the denser cities like Manhattan are the cities that perform the best.
So a year goes by before the cancer, as cancers do, reappears, and with it comes another death sentence, this time nine months.
It's part of the human condition, and yet our system and our thinking isn't built to accommodate it.
It's part of our DNA as humans, and maybe it's time our healthcare system -- doctors, patients, insurance companies, us, started accounting for the power of that hope.
In fact, we didn't develop the app to make it available, just as a proof of concept.
Now, that movie is set in 2054, about 40 years from now, and as exciting as that technology looks, it already vastly underestimates the amount of information that organizations can gather about you, and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not even detect.
Right now, many of us do not even know that the fight is going on, but it is, whether you like it or not.
As a child, I would hate being made to wear the Indian kurta pajama, because I didn't think it was very cool.
It felt a bit girly to me, like a dress, and it had this baggy trouser part you had to tie really tight to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down.
My dad never wore it, so I didn't see why I had to.
Also, it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable, that people assume I represent something genuinely Indian when I wear it, because that's not how I feel.
HP:  YR: Actually, the only way I feel comfortable wearing it is by pretending they are the robes of a kung fu warrior like Li Mu Bai from that film, "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."
Now you put water into a cup. It becomes the cup.
You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.
Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
Put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
Now, water can flow or it can crash.
It doesn't always go as you plan it, even with a talented translator.
It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.
So we've gone from sustainability being a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do.
But then the people that the Romans would have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors, were actually part of the Industrial Revolution, and in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate, and you saw that get quicker and quicker, and it's been impacting everyone.
And if I lay sub-Saharan growth on top of the Indian growth story, it's remarkably similar.
It was something very similar to the phase transition that occurs when water turns into ice below zero degrees.
And this substance may seem invisible to us, but it has a physical reality.
It surrounds us all the time, just like the air we breathe in this room.
And this intrinsic energy is what we call the mass of a particle, and by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC has conclusively proved that this substance is real, because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of.
It has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation.
It would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach.
And the reason is simple: because wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall.
It's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness, the victories and the disappointments, but it's because how because of these, and sometimes, more importantly, in spite of these, we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves.
Without it, we would have no music.
Why not buy his book? Tweet it. Share it.
Travel can be liberating, but when it is incessant, we become permanent exiles without repose.
For some reason, technology seems to perpetuate the illusion for those who have it that everyone does, and then, like an ironic slap in the face, it makes it true.
Time-warping technology challenges our deepest core, because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget, even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable.
The digital world cannibalizes time, and in doing so, I want to suggest that what it threatens is the completeness of ourselves.
It threatens the flow of love.
pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes, their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka.
In the next decade, the zone's human residents will be gone, and it will revert to a wild, radioactive place, full only of animals and occasionally daring, flummoxed scientists.
And it so happens that this is a product that, because of its nature, a business model to address this market requires you to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed.
It occurred throughout the central nervous system, including in the brain stem, where we observed up to 300-percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain.
And it's a pretty big building.
Right? It's pretty big.
Inside NSA, the unit is called TAO, Tailored Access Operations, and inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent, it's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.
Mathematics is the science of patterns, and we study it to learn how to think logically, critically and creatively, but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated, and when our students ask, "Why are we learning this?"
Well, on the one hand, it's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it, right?
On the other hand, because it's a rectangle, the area is equal to its height times its base, and the height is clearly eight, and the base is five plus eight, which is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right?
On the third day, it was gone.
I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal, and as it went off, I was just about to step out into the street, when all of a sudden, my right hand was just gripped by this guy, and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street, speaking to me in Mandarin.
In the 1970s, when it appeared that the price of energy would never retreat, our economy was soaring, and then in the early 1980s, it cratered quickly.
It was taking place inside the homes, mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids.
It was taking place in churches.
And as I'm sitting in the lobby waiting to talk to the reporter, I notice there's a magazine copy of the current issue right there on the table, and I pick it up, and I look at the headline "America's Fattest Cities: Do You Live in One?"
It's the only game in the world that I know of that allows you, the player, the opportunity to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less.
If you have a free thumb, wave it around, make sure it gets connected.
If you have a free thumb, wave it around, make sure it gets connected.
If you have a free thumb, wave it around to make sure.
Now you know how to play it. You can teach other people.
Now whatever your mission is, once you've programmed it, you simply upload it to the autopilot system, bring your drone to the field, and launch it simply by tossing it in the air.
Usually it does, and when it does, it even lands automatically.
It carries a variety of sensors, and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel.
I bring up this example to begin, because it emphasizes how little we know about nature.
How do we do that if we don't know the geography of biodiversity in the region, if it's so unknown to science?
We were looking forward to rebuilding it, but eight months after we moved in, I suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect.
It's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network.
It's a network for a transportation of matter.
We call it Matternet.
If it is a new paradigm, though, there must be other uses for it.
It can be used perhaps in other places in the world.
These are places that do have road infrastructure, but it's very inefficient.
It's not something we can turn off.
If you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay?
It allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge.
It allows us to reach back into our long-term memory and pull some of that in as we need it, mixes it, processes it in light of whatever our current goal is.
It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie, or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room.
Now working memory capacity has a fairly long history, and it's associated with a lot of positive effects.
Now the problem that we have is that life comes at us, and it comes at us very quickly, and what we need to do is to take that amorphous flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it with a working memory that's about the size of a pea.
It allows us to problem-solve, critical think.
We can be in the middle of a meeting, listen to somebody's presentation, evaluate it, decide whether or not we like it, ask follow-up questions.
We can be in the middle of a meeting, listen to somebody's presentation, evaluate it, decide whether or not we like it, ask follow-up questions.
Now, a central issue with working memory is that it's limited.
It's very positive.
If we're not processing life, we're not living it.
It must be really extraordinary, an exception to the rule.
Theirs may be bigger, but ours is better, and it could be better, for example, in that it seems larger than it should be, with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies.
So the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes.
Although it weighs only two percent of the body, it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy that your body requires to run per day.
So the human brain is larger than it should be, it uses much more energy than it should, so it's special.
I've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number, and I could never find it.
It works like this: You take a brain, or parts of that brain, and you dissolve it in detergent, which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact, so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei that looks like this, like a clear soup.
Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup, you can agitate it and make those nuclei be distributed homogeneously in the liquid, so that now by looking under the microscope at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution, you can count nuclei, and therefore tell how many cells that brain had.
Take rodents and primates, for instance: In larger rodent brains, the average size of the neuron increases, so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons.
Because we found that the relationship between the size of the brain and its number of neurons could be described mathematically, we could calculate what a human brain would look like if it was made like a rodent brain.
It is just a large primate brain.
So the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons, and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal, the relative cost of our brain is large, but just because we're primates, not because we're special.
We calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods, and on the other hand, how much energy a body of a certain size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs, and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day.
I now look at my kitchen, and I bow to it, and I thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans.
And how does it work?
It's a gift. You haven't earned it.
It's a gift. You haven't earned it.
You haven't brought it about in any way.
What you are really grateful for is the opportunity, not the thing that is given to you, because if that thing were somewhere else and you didn't have the opportunity to enjoy it, to do something with it, you wouldn't be grateful for it.
We can avail ourselves of this opportunity, or we can miss it, and if we avail ourselves of the opportunity, it is the key to happiness.
Actually, when you look at it and experience it, you find that most of the time, what is given to us is the opportunity to enjoy, and we only miss it because we are rushing through life and we are not stopping to see the opportunity.
Everywhere you find it, a grateful airline, a restaurant gratefulness, a café gratefulness, a wine that is gratefulness.
It can change our world in immensely important ways, because if you're grateful, you're not fearful, and if you're not fearful, you're not violent.
We have a network for grateful living, and it has mushroomed.
We couldn't understand why it mushroomed.
People are becoming aware that a grateful world is a happy world, and we all have the opportunity by the simple stop, look, go, to transform the world, to make it a happy place.
Well, there's a multitude of factors at play, but I think one of the key factors is that the tools that we currently have available to test whether a drug is going to work, whether it has efficacy, or whether it's going to be safe before we get it into human clinical trials, are failing us. They're not predicting what's going to happen in humans.
It sticks, it wiggles its way through between the cell layers, through the pore, comes out on the other side of the membrane, and right there, it's going to engulf the bacteria labeled in green.
Now I want to share this picture with you, not just because it's so beautiful, but because it tells us an enormous amount of information about what the cells are doing within the chips.
Those of you like me who have asthma, when you take your inhaler, we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs, how it enters the body, how it might affect, say, your heart.
Does it change the beating of your heart?
Is it metabolized in the liver? Is it excreted in your kidneys?
It does something else that's very important.
It creates an easy user interface.
So a cell biologist like me can come in, take a chip, put it in a cartridge like the prototype you see there, put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a C.D., and away you go.
And second, I don't care about the word, I care about how you use it.
It's something that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world, but something that we're all participating in.
We have been so used to inequality, sometimes, that it's before our noses and we do not see it.
We have been so used to inequality, sometimes, that it's before our noses and we do not see it.
Then the city grows around it.
And I discovered another fact, which to me was more astonishing almost for the fact that I hadn't known it before at the age of 42, 43.
We are more dependent on it now than ever.
And yet, for such an enormous industry -- there are a 100,000 working vessels on the sea — it's become pretty much invisible.
Because the biggest dramatic change in shipping over the last 60 years, when most of the general public stopped noticing it, was something called an open registry, or a flag of convenience.
But a supertanker can also be heard coming across a whole ocean, and because the noise that propellers make underwater is sometimes at the same frequency that whales use, then it can damage their acoustic habitat, and they need this for breeding, for finding feeding grounds, for finding mates.
It has opened up opportunities to do more projects in Gando.
It brings sand and gravel to the river we need to use to build.
We take the sand, we mix it with clay, and we keep building.
Well, those of you who have ever seen or touched snow, you know that it's really light, because it's just a bunch of tiny ice crystals clumped together, and it's mostly air.
If you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball, it gets really small, hard and dense.
Now each year, as new snow lands on the glacier, it melts in the summer sun, and it forms little rivers of water on the flow along the ice, and they start to melt and bore their way down through the glacier, forming big networks of caves, sometimes going all the way down to the underlying bedrock.
So when you're done surveying, you take all this data and you punch it into a computer and you find someone that can draw really well, and you have them draft up a map that looks something like this, and it'll show you both a bird's-eye view of the passage as well as a profile view of the passage, kind of like an ant farm view.
We named this cave Snow Dragon Cave because it was like a big dragon sleeping under the snow.
It's been frozen in the ice for over 100 years, and it's just now starting to sprout.
It goes to bite me a second time.
My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out.
It was sort of a hollow in the ground.
Would it open up beneath my bed and swallow me as I slept?
It has been demonstrated in over 400 empirical studies.
But our desire to believe this story is so deeply embedded that we are reinventing it again for the scientific age, for example, with the idea of cryonics.
But even though, in its current form, in its traditional form, the idea of the soul is still hugely popular, reinventing it for the digital age, for example with the idea that you can leave your body behind by uploading your mind, your essence, the real you, onto a computer, and so live on as an avatar in the ether.
Now, overcoming this bias is not easy because the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us, yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational, and when we bring out into the open the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us, then we can at least start to try to minimize the influence it has on our lives.
Now, I find it helps to see life as being like a book: Just as a book is bounded by its covers, by beginning and end, so our lives are bounded by birth and death, and even though a book is limited by beginning and end, it can encompass distant landscapes, exotic figures, fantastic adventures.
And you needn't worry how long the book is, or whether it's a comic strip or an epic.
The only thing that matters is that you make it a good story.
So that question is really powerful, and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment, when you connect it to the stories that some Detroiters had, and actually a lot of African-Americans' families have had that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit.
So that question is really powerful, and it was certainly powerful to us in the moment, when you connect it to the stories that some Detroiters had, and actually a lot of African-Americans' families have had that are living in Midwestern cities like Detroit.
It can provide fresh foods, and it can put Detroiters back to work too."
Einstein said that "I never think about the future — it comes soon enough."
It's a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automatically when we need it without having to look for it.
It's a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automatically when we need it without having to look for it.
By the time it lands, they will already know if anything needs to be serviced.
The list goes on, and it will grow fast, because industrial data are now growing exponentially.
It makes products more affordable.
It creates new demand, new jobs.
And every time I hear this, I can't help thinking that even back in the Stone Age, there must have been a group of cavemen sitting around a fire one day looking very grumpy, and looking disapprovingly at another group of cavemen rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill, and saying to each other, "Yeah, this wheel thing, cool toy, sure, but compared to fire, it will have no impact.
So think about the future — it will be here soon enough.
How do you put it in their hands so that it is useful?
How do you put it in their hands so that it is useful?
Despite the advanced technology, it's not reaching the people who need it most.
So at D-Rev, we've done some other projects, and we looked at three things that we really believe gets technologies to customers, to users, to people who need it.
It needs to perform on par or better than the best products on the market.
Everything that goes into ensuring that this product gets to the end user, and it goes in as part of the system, and it's used.
We made it thinner.
We really, truly believe that if a product is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed, it needs to be market-driven, and market-driven means that products are sold.
It also has to be designed to be very affordable.
We'll double the impact in 2015, and we'll double it each of the following years after that.
And here we've been on this journey, and the truth is, it's been thrilling.
And it was deep. It was deep in my soul.
The water's 85 degrees, and yet you're losing weight and using calories, and as you come over toward the side of the boat, not allowed to touch it, not allowed to get out, but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition and asks me what I'm doing, am I all right, I am seeing the Taj Mahal over here.
But I thought I needed to lose weight, and when I gained it back, of course I blamed myself.
It keeps the temperature in your house the same as the weather changes outside.
Your brain works exactly the same way, responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal.
We would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not, but it can't.
You can take control of your health by taking control of your lifestyle, even If you can't lose weight and keep it off.
What if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it?
I'm not even sure it was taken at the same moment as the bird's-eye view.
Can I add a slider on top of Google Maps and just change the year, seeing how it was 100 years before, 1,000 years before?
If I take a log book, I can consider, it's not just a log book of a Venetian captain going to a particular journey.
If I have a painting of a facade, I can consider it's not just that particular building, but probably it also shares the same grammar of buildings where we lost any information.
Now, capitalism has done a lot of good things and I've talked about a lot of good things that have happened, but equally, it has not been able to meet up with some of the challenges that we've seen The model that at least I was brought up in and a lot of us doing business were brought up in was one which talked about what I call the three G's of growth:
It is going to be to redefine the new business models which understand that the only license to operate is to combine these things.
The same thing happened when I wrote my book. I started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter, I thought it was fabulous. It was chock-full of data and figures, I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai tribes, and their sociological patterns.

They need to look at this, anticipate the barriers, and recognize them, put them out in the open, have the dialogue about it, but that it's really for women who are that. Doing that. Pursuing the corporate world.
We have to get rid of the word bossy and bring back --  I think I would say in a louder voice, we need to get rid of the word "bossy" and bring back the word "feminist," because we need it.
Leonardo himself had preached against the use of gold, so it was absolutely anathema at that moment.
It's such an extraordinarily artificial color.
It reminded me, in an odd kind of way, of my niece's fifth birthday party.
And it's based, actually, on a more elevated piece of porcelain.
So, if you want to find the right motion for a character, don't think about it -- go use your body to find it.
Stand in front of a mirror, act it out in front of a camera -- whatever you need -- and then put it back in your character.
And here when you see the robot interacting with me on a desktop -- and I'm actually redesigning the robot, so, unbeknownst to itself, it's kind of digging its own grave by helping me.
I wanted it to be less of a mechanical structure giving me light, and more of a helpful, kind of quiet apprentice that's always there when you need it and doesn't really interfere.
They thought it was more intelligent, more committed, a better member of the team, contributed to the success of the team more.
And so I tried to do the same things, this time with music, where the robot doesn't really know what it's about to play, it just sort of moves its body and uses opportunities to play, and does what my jazz teacher when I was 17 taught me.
And I thought, we already have a robot musician on stage, why not make it be a full-fledged musician?
The head doesn’t actually touch the marimba, it just expresses what the music is like.
And notice one thing -- how the robot is really showing us the beat it's picking up from the human, while also giving the human a sense that the robot knows what it's doing.
And also how it changes the way it moves as soon as it starts its own solo.
Now it's looking at me, showing that it's listening.
Just to introduce the last robot that we've worked on, it came out of something surprising that we found: Some point people didn't care about the robot being intelligent, able to improvise and listen, and do all these embodied intelligence things that I spent years developing.
But running across it are three red lines -- these are topics you are not supposed to challenge in word or deed.
And it is the product of a complex historical process, one which has gained ground with the rise of Islamic conservatism since the late 1970s.
And whenever a company reorganizes, restructures, reengineers, goes through a cultural transformation program, it chooses these two pillars.
It can only add new boxes, new bones in the skeleton.
Really? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution, and it still can't tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers on a Tuesday night open mic?
And I did. I went back every single week, and sure enough, week after week, it didn't get any better. The same thing happened every week.  I couldn't shake it.
It starts with an M.
I call it teen-lish.
It's got two sounds: a grunt and a silence.
And all I had to do was go and bless it, "Good answer."
It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs, the business aspect.
Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever you can think of.
I was greatly influenced by art, and I wanted to incorporate it in everything I did, even my business.
These actions can pollute the air, making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it.
And for all those years, I've had an absolutely passionate and sometimes not popular belief that this violence is not inevitable, that it is learned, and if it's learned, it can be un-learned, and it can be prevented.
He called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.
I am a data nerd, and the reason for that is I want to make sure that if we spend a dollar, that the program works, and if it doesn't work, we should change the plan.
It is about economic empowerment for women, it is about healing kids who are hurt, and it is about prevention with a capital P.
Today, it's sitting in its final launch configuration ready to blast off in a few short weeks.
It's particularly a cultural crisis, a crisis of the institutions unable to reimagine the stupid ways which we have been growing, unable to challenge the oil-hungry, selfish urbanization that have perpetuated cities based on consumption, from southern California to New York to Dubai.
For me as an architect, it has become a fundamental narrative, because it begins to teach me that this micro-community not only designed another category of public space but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols that were necessary to be inscribed in that space for its long-term sustainability.
You have to imagine the other hand. It's not there yet.
It has a rounded body, two arms, and a very tall, head-like antenna, and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself.
So when a viewer passes by, it sort of tilts from side to side, and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer.
But the idea is that once it's got the person's attention, it's no longer interested, and it looks for the next person whose attention to get.
And so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention, but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help.
Now, one thing all those rhythms have in common is math, and I call it a-rhythm-etic.
It is hard to say what shape this intensification will take, because it largely depends on social and technical innovations, which are by definition difficult to predict.
It's brown to start with.
Therefore, it must be good for the environment.
It's biodegradable. It's reusable.
In some cases, it's recyclable.
So the thing about environmental folklore is it tends to be based on our experiences, the things we've heard from other people.
It doesn't tend to be based on any scientific framework.
Now biodegradability is a material property; it is not a definition of environmental benefits.
And I blame it on the refrigerator, well, especially in Western cultures, because it makes it easier.
So imagine if you designed kettles, you actually found a way to solve these system failures, because this is a huge amount of pressure on the system, just because the product hasn't thought about the problem that it's going to have when it exists in the world.
If you just had paper or plastic -- obviously reusable is far more beneficial -- then the paper is worse, and the paper is worse because it weighs four to 10 times more than the plastic, and when we actually compare, from a life cycle perspective, a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper, the paper is far better, but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag to carry your groceries home is not done with a kilo of each material.
And he said, "Well, recently I pitched a sustainability project to a client, and turned and he said to me, 'I know it's going to cost less, I know it's going to sell more, but we're not pioneers, because pioneers have arrows in their backs.'" I think we've got a roomful of pioneers, and I hope there are far more pioneers out there, because we need to solve these problems.
It means limiting future risk by minimizing harm to people and planet, and it means providing capital to users who deploy it towards productive and sustainable outcomes.
Now a fair question might be, what if all this sustainability risk stuff is exaggerated, overstated, it's not urgent, something for virtuous consumers or lifestyle choice?
As a speech scientist, I'm fascinated by how the voice is produced, and I have an idea for how it can be engineered.
Now before I get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it, I need to give you a real quick speech science lesson. Okay?
Why don't we take the source from the person we want the voice to sound like, because it's preserved, and borrow the filter from someone about the same age and size, because they can articulate speech, and then mix them?
They see around corners, shaping their future, not just reacting to it.
Now, since Darwin's day there's been what Cacilda and I have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution, and you're all familiar with it, even if you haven't read this stuff.
We don't share it with the other three apes, the gorilla, the orangutan and the gibbon, who are more typical of mammals, having sex only about a dozen times per birth.
It goes into anthropology as well.
Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system, and it is a deeply democratic activity.
It's about critical thinking.
It's about questioning existing ways of doing things.
It's the idea that if you see a problem, you work to fix it, and not just complain about it.
In fact, a few years back, I developed an app for the iPad which does exactly this. It's called Avaz, and the way it works is that kids select different pictures.
So Avaz is essentially converting pictures, it's a translator, it converts pictures into speech.
What it doesn't help them do is to learn word patterns.
It's what comes after thought but before language.
Then we make it "can't pay," and we can make it "couldn't pay" by making it the past tense.
They found that when you learn a language as a child, as a two-year-old, you learn it with a certain part of your brain, and when you learn a language as an adult -- for example, if I wanted to learn Japanese right now — a completely different part of my brain is used.
I think it's the most beautiful of human creations.
It entertains, it educates, it enlightens, but what I like the most about language is that it empowers.
It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster.
It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster.
The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas -- in fact, it's plasma.
If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up.
What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate.
They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate.
Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower.
And we need a way to simplify it.
But what if a country can't afford to pay more because it's maybe too expensive?
How is it managed?
It's important for you to know if the government of your country is able to manage a crisis, if the government is finally able to implement the reforms that it's promised.
And this is why we are testing our model right now, and why we are trying to find out if it can bring together a group of able and willing actors to bring INCRA to life.
They'd sent them an invoice for a sale, but the Egyptians never bought it.
Of course, he's also acknowledged that once the software has been sold to governments, he has no way of knowing how it can be used.
As I said, it's a $5 billion industry.
The video they've produced is very sexy, and so I'm going to play you a clip just so you can get a feel both for the capabilities of the software but also how it's marketed to their government clients.
Last year we learned, for example, that it's been used to target Moroccan journalists by the Moroccan government.
Many, many countries it's been found in.
Because strawberry DNA is really fascinating, because it's so beautiful.
I am still completely committed to the cause of male-female equality, but let's think about what that equality really means, and how best to achieve it.
If breadwinning and caregiving are really equal, then why shouldn't a government invest as much in an infrastructure of care as the foundation of a healthy society as it invests in physical infrastructure as the backbone of a successful economy?
It's certainly not complete.
It is happening.
It will happen.
All the places with lots of electricity, it isn't.
And it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus, not to mention it's a pretty good size.
The biggest penis-to-body-size ratio in the animal kingdom actually belongs to the meager beach barnacle, and this video is actually showing you what the human penis would look like if it were the same size as that of a barnacle.
It's very common in many phyla, from invertebrates to avian species, mammals, and, of course, even in primates.
It looks and feels like it sounds: Wormwood Scrubs. Built at the end of the Victorian Era by the inmates themselves, it is where England's most dangerous prisoners are kept.
So if you rear a mouse in a standard cage, a shoebox, essentially, with cotton wool, alone and without much stimulation, not only does it not thrive, but it will often develop strange, repetitive behaviors.
It became the first program of its kind -- but it's really of the Dutch kind -- in North America.
It really says it all.
Reason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony if the reasoner wants peace and harmony, but it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife.
But all on its own, it's a feeble instrument for making moral progress.
For one thing, it's innately biased toward blood relations, babies and warm, fuzzy animals.
For a punishment to achieve its objective, it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime, and into this calculation ought to be factored the certainty of punishment and the loss of the good that the commission of the crime will produce.
Erasmus: The advantages derived from peace diffuse themselves far and wide, and reach great numbers, while in war, if anything turns out happily, the advantage redounds only to a few, and those unworthy of reaping it.
It was a movement spearheaded by the Quakers, and it only became popular when Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel "Uncle Tom's Cabin" became a bestseller.
John Locke: Freedom of men under government is to have a standing rule to live by common to everyone of that society and made by the legislative power erected in it, a liberty to follow my own will in all things where that rule prescribes not, not to be subject to the inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man, as freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint
RNG: And if, our friends, you detect a flaw in this argument, just remember you'll be depending on reason to point it out.
As the Iranian government found out when, through a series of front companies, it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan, on Fifth Avenue, despite American sanctions.
The U.K. government is already on board; it supports these public registries.
And then about 30 seconds before launch, the vehicle is completely alive -- it is ready to go -- the APUs are running, the computers are all self-contained, it's ready to leave the planet.
And having the goal in mind, thinking about where it might lead, directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible, to be able to launch and go help build a space station where you are on board a million-pound creation that's going around the world at five miles a second, eight kilometers a second, around the world 16 times a day,
It's roaring silently with color and texture as it pours by mesmerizingly next to you.
And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters here in B.C., there's about 720, 730 different types of spiders and there's one -- one -- that is venomous, and its venom isn't even fatal, it's just kind of like a nasty sting.
And that spider -- not only that, but that spider has beautiful markings on it, it's like "I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation symbol on my back, it's the black widow."
So, if you're even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider -- and it lives close the ground, you're walking along, you are never going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you.
And its a black widow because the female spider eats the male; it doesn't care about you.
Well, next time you see a spiderweb, have a good look, make sure it's not a black widow spider, and then walk into it.
And in fact, you can fly this meteorite and steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle anywhere on the Earth.
CH: And you roll to a stop as if someone threw your spaceship at the ground and it tumbles end over end, but you're ready for it you're in a custom-built seat, you know how the shock absorber works.
I know this song, and it's really a tribute to the genius of David Bowie himself, but it's also, I think, a reflection of the fact that we are not machines exploring the universe, we are people, and we're taking and that ability to understand and the ability to take our own self-perception into a new place.
RL: So there are, when our legitimate foreign intelligence targets of the type that I described before, use the global telecommunications system as their communications methodology, and they do, because it's a great system, it's the most complex system ever devised by man, and it is a wonder, and lots of folks in the room there are responsible for the creation and enhancement of that, and it's just a wonderful thing.
But it's also used by people who are working against us and our allies.
CA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that when it comes to the Internet at large, any strategy is fair game if it improves America's safety.
They think of it as a momentous invention of humanity, kind of on a par with the Gutenberg press, for example.
It's the bringer of knowledge to all.
It's the connector of all.
And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms.
RL: I do understand that, and I actually share the view of the utility of the Internet, and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet.
It is a global telecommunications system.
The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body, but it also does other things.
It castrates them, it changes their color from transparent to bright red, it makes them live longer, and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found, it makes them swim in groups.
Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce, so to get there, it manipulates its shrimp hosts into forming these conspicuous colored swarms that are easier for a flamingo to spot and to devour, and that is the secret of the Artemia swarm.
The worm grew to adult size within it, but it needs to get into water in order to mate, and it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket's brain, causing it to behave erratically.
The worm grew to adult size within it, but it needs to get into water in order to mate, and it does that by releasing proteins that addle the cricket's brain, causing it to behave erratically.
When the cricket nears a body of water, such as this swimming pool, it jumps in and drowns, and the worm wriggles out of its suicidal corpse.
This caterpillar was attacked by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it.
Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind and controlled it into defending their siblings which are metamorphosing into adults within those cocoons.
It is a critical and common part of the world around us, and scientists have now found hundreds of examples of such manipulators, and more excitingly, they're starting to understand exactly how these creatures control their hosts.
It doesn't kill the roach, nor does it sedate it.
The roach could walk away or fly or run if it chose to, but it doesn't choose to, because the venom nixes its motivation to walk, and only that.
It's more of an extension of the wasp, just like the cricket was an extension of the Gordian worm.
Toxo infects mammals, a wide variety of mammals, but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat.
If the infected rat smells the delightful odor of cat piss, it runs towards the source of the smell rather than the more sensible direction of away.
It has no consciousness.
It doesn't even have a body.
But it's manipulating a mammal?
It was like oxygen, around us and necessary for life.
My dad said it was called the Pantheon, a temple for all of the gods.
It didn't look all that special from the outside, as I said, but when we walked inside, I was immediately struck by three things: First of all, it was pleasantly cool despite the oppressive heat outside.
Dad explained that this wasn't a big open hole, but it was called the oculus, an eye to the heavens.
It was modern, high-tech, impressive, a huge 142-foot clear span which, not coincidentally, was exactly its height.
It was really beautiful and unlike anything I'd ever seen before, so I asked my dad, "When was this built?"
And incidentally, it is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome that's ever been built.
It survived gravity, barbarians, looters, developers and the ravages of time to become what I believe is the longest continuously occupied building in history.
It's more like the invention of concrete: important, absolutely necessary to build the Pantheon, and enduring, but entirely insufficient by itself.
We need to help them to find their own role models, and give them the confidence to believe in themselves and to believe that anything is possible, and just as my grandpa did when he took me shopping for surplus, and just as my parents did when they took me to science museums, we need to encourage them to find their own path, even if it's very different from our own.
This time it's sending the same message and link.
We could call it cluefulness.
Now it's been 14 billion years since that Big Bang, and so it's got faint and cold.
But if you wait, that ringing fades and fades and fades until you don't notice it anymore.
This little space became a small phenomenon, and because it had such a profound impact on New Yorkers, it made an enormous impression on me.
I studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather, so I knew that places like Paley Park didn't happen by accident.
But what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it?
And this sandy wasteland had lain barren for 10 years, and we were told, unless we found a developer in six months, it would go bankrupt.
So you see, no matter how popular and successful a public space may be, it can never be taken for granted.
It can hover, fly backwards, even upside down.
The old arrangement might not have been particularly ethical, but it was reciprocal.
One was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe in one skit and then swallowed it.
We have to get rid of it.
It blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it.
It blocks out most of the light so we can see that dim corona around it.
We build a big screen, we fly it in space, we put it up in front of the star, we block out most of the light, we fly a space telescope in that shadow that's created, and boom, we get to see planets.
But few consumers are concerned to know where a particular typeface came from or when or who designed it, if, indeed, there was any human agency involved in its creation, if it didn't just sort of materialize out of the software ether.
I can't stand it. Nor can Chris.
It kind of determined the proportions of the design.
It does hide its methods.
The distinction between a constraint and a compromise is obviously very subtle, but it's very central to my attitude to work.
This is from the mid-'70s early trials of Bell Centennial typeface I designed for the U.S. phone books, and it was my first experience of digital type, and quite a baptism.
We call it Charter, on the right.
The technology did suggest something to me, but it did not force my hand, and I think this happens very often.
It was only a stopgap.
We see it even in the life of the indomitable Arctic explorer Ben Saunders, who tells me that his triumphs are not merely the result of a grand achievement, but of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins.
The reason the near win has a propulsion is because it changes our view of the landscape and puts our goals, which we tend to put at a distance, into more proximate vicinity to where we stand.
If I ask you to envision what a great day looks like next week, you might describe it in more general terms.
It gets us to focus on what, right now, we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights.
It galvanized a whole generation of human beings to realize that we're on Spaceship Earth, fragile and finite as it is, and that we need to take care of it.
But while this picture is beautiful, it's static, and the Earth is constantly changing.
We call this satellite "Dove," and we call it "Dove" because satellites are typically named after birds, but normally birds of prey: like Eagle, Hawk, Swoop, Kill, I don't know, Kestrel, these sort of things.
And I did, in the end, find that inspiration, but I found it in the most unlikely and unexpected place.
I found it in lessons that I had learned earlier in life about how creativity can survive its own failure.
The only thing that it is capable of feeling is the absolute value of this emotional equation, the exact distance that you have been flung from yourself.
And if we move it in a way that doesn't really make sense with the underlying molecular simulation, we get this physical feedback where we can actually feel these physical handles pulling back against us.
It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils, to increase surface area compared to volume to let heat out, and because the leg is like a pendulum, the longer and thinner it is at the extremity, the more energy-efficient it is to swing.
It's endlessly complex, but somehow familiar, but the patterns kind of repeat, but they never repeat exactly.
EDI: A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it deceived a human into believing it was human.
It's been sampled 547 times.
It was made in 1984 by these two legends of hip-hop, Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh, and the Ray-Ban and Jheri curl look is so strong.
I had to make that joke in this room, because you would be the only people that I'd ever have a chance of getting it.
Imagine any other singer from that era over it singing the same old lyrics.
All that matters to the ant is the rate at which it meets other ants.
This makes sense for the ant colony, because the more food there is out there, the more quickly the foragers find it, the faster they come back, and the more foragers they send out.
And what we're looking for is whether there might be small differences among colonies in how many interactions each ant needs before it's willing to go out and forage, because a colony like that would forage less.
Each symbol is a colony, and the size of the symbol is how many offspring it had, because we were able to use genetic variation to match up parent and offspring colonies, that is, to figure out which colonies were founded by a daughter queen produced by which parent colony.
But as soon as the threat is passed, the entrance is open again, and maybe there are situations in computer security where operating costs are low enough that we could just block access temporarily in response to an immediate threat, and then open it again, instead of trying to build a permanent firewall or fortress.
So when one ant meets another, or when it meets a chemical deposited on the ground by another, then it changes direction to follow in the direction of the interaction, and that's how you get the trail of ants sharing your picnic.
It means I can fall asleep at night and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger.
And it goes on, but as soon as I read this poem, I fell for it hard, so hard, I suspected we must have met somewhere before.
Half a globe away, a teenager made an Instagram video of it and sent it to me, a stranger.
When I got this mix tape, I put it in my cassette player, I took it to the campus library, her library, I found 14 books on the shelves.
It also doesn't need a lot of land, something that's in short supply, compared to other protein sources.
It also has a very low carbon footprint.
It's already a big part of our diet, but it can be a bigger part of our diet, which is a good thing, because we know that it's healthy for us.
Are you sure that's what it was?
It propelled me to go on and to co-lead a team that discovered the first cancer susceptibility gene, and in the intervening decades since then, there has been literally a seismic shift in our understanding of what goes on, what genetic variations are sitting behind various diseases.
I used to think I would know myself to be mature when I could simply be gay without emphasis, but the self-loathing of that period left a void, and celebration needs to fill and overflow it, and even if I repay my private debt of melancholy, there's still an outer world of homophobia that it will take decades to address.
There's always somebody who wants to confiscate our humanity, and there are always stories that restore it.
So whenever they'd launch a big ship, they would invite some dignitary up from London on the train to make a speech, break a bottle of champagne over the bows, launch it down the slipway into the river and out to sea.
So the procession is moving at a stately pace down my street, and as it approaches my house, I start to wave my flag vigorously, and there is the Queen Mother.
It's my right.
So if you look in the dictionaries and if you think about it, one very natural definition of religion is that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings.
I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it, but here's my story, and true or not, it's a story that I think gives you a good sense of how the list might have come about, and therefore helps you to think about what use the list might be.
It consists of the things that other people had instead of Christianity.
It was actually adverted to earlier, but a very specific thing happened in the history of the kind of Christianity that we see around us mostly in the United States today, and it happened in the late 19th century, and that specific thing that happened in the late 19th century was a kind of deal that was cut between science, this new way of organizing intellectual authority, and religion.
So how does it do so?
First of all, you are right, change does slow down as we age, but second, you're wrong, because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think.
It transforms our preferences.
It reshapes our values.
It alters our personalities.
It's furnished at least three science fiction titles, I think because it says poems can brings us news from the future or the past or across the world, because their patterns can seem to tell you what's in somebody's heart.
It says poems can bring people together temporarily, which I think is true, and it sticks in my head not just because it rhymes but for how it rhymes, cleanly and simply on the two and four, "say" and "way," with anticipatory hints on the one and three, "answer" and "quarters," as if the poem itself were coming together.
It's a poem about loneliness -- the "I" in the poem feels no connection will last — and it might look like a plea for help 'til you get to the word "help," where this "I" facing you, taking your hand, is more like a teacher or a genie, or at least that's what he wants to believe.
It might not make any sense to you if you haven't seen it before.
It might not make any sense to you if you haven't seen it before.
It's about the Garden of Eden and the Fall and the Biblical story of the Fall, in which sex as we know it and death and guilt come into the world at the same time.
It's also about how appearances deceive, how our culture can sweep us along into doing and saying things we didn't intend or don't like, and Armantrout's style is trying to help us stop or slow down.
"This living hand, now warm and capable Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold And in the icy silence of the tomb, So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights That thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood So in my veins red life might stream again, And thou be conscience-calm’d -- see here it is -- I hold it towards you."
"This living hand, now warm and capable Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold And in the icy silence of the tomb, So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights That thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood So in my veins red life might stream again, And thou be conscience-calm’d -- see here it is -- I hold it towards you."
It has spines, gluey pads and claws, but if you take off those feet, they can still go over rough terrain, like the bottom video that you see, without hardly slowing down. Extraordinary.
My engineering colleague at Berkeley designed with his students a novel manufacturing technique where you essentially origami the exoskeleton, you laser cut it, laminate it, and you fold it up into a robot.
So a mouse is escaping a predator, its path is blocked, it'll try to invent a new solution.
That's when the dinosaurs went extinct, that's when 75 percent of the animal and plant species went extinct, and that's when mammals overtook their ecological niche, and to anthropomorphize, biological evolution said, "Hmm, this neocortex is pretty good stuff," and it began to grow it.
If you took the human neocortex and stretched it out, it's about the size of a table napkin, and it's still a thin structure.
Ordinarily you wouldn't think so, but we're expecting an E, it's good enough, and yeah, I've seen an E, and then apple says, "Yeah, I've seen an Apple."
They just made it up.
Less than one percent were in the room when it passed the House.
I didn't really know what it did, but I copy-pasted it and used it anyway to get into a password-protected site like that.
I didn't really know what it did, but I copy-pasted it and used it anyway to get into a password-protected site like that.
But there are other hackers, hackers who just like to break things, and it is precisely those hackers that can find the weaker elements in our world and make us fix it.
Perhaps they thought universal access was a feature, not a bug, until two months ago when a group of hackers used it to get into people's files.
This got their attention, all right, and they fixed the bug, but because he hadn't reported it properly, he was denied the bounty usually paid out for such discoveries.
It turns out, the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it, and it will react with cyberattacks and elaborate pranks and with a series of organized protests all around the world, from my hometown of Tel Aviv to Adelaide, Australia.
It turns out, the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it, and it will react with cyberattacks and elaborate pranks and with a series of organized protests all around the world, from my hometown of Tel Aviv to Adelaide, Australia.
And if the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it, just watch what happens This took place in Egypt in January 2011, and as President Hosni Mubarak attempted a desperate move to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo, he sent his personal troops down to Egypt's Internet service providers and had them physically kill the switch on the country's connection to the world overnight.
And so the establishment has long had a love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers, because the same people who demonize hacking also utilize it at large.
I think most people, when they say a word isn't real, what they mean is, it doesn't appear in a standard dictionary.
It's not. It is rich and vibrant and filled with the creativity of the speakers who speak it.
I hope you can enjoy being part of the creativity that is continually remaking our language and keeping it robust.
It gets in because we use it and we keep using it, and dictionary editors are paying attention to us.
It gets in because we use it and we keep using it, and dictionary editors are paying attention to us.
If a community of speakers is using a word and knows what it means, it's real.
A higher salary makes the banking job better than it was before, but it might not be enough to make being a banker better than being an artist.
But if an improvement in one of the jobs doesn't make it better than the other, then the two original jobs could not have been equally good.
This response in hard choices is a rational response, but it's not dictated by reasons given to us.
Rather, it's supported by reasons created by us.
Even as a child I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it; I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it.
I'll always be a traveler -- my livelihood depends on it -- but one of the beauties of travel is that it allows you to bring stillness into the motion and the commotion of the world.
And I think many of us have the sensation, I certainly do, that we're standing about two inches away from a huge screen, and it's noisy and it's crowded and it's changing with every second, and that screen is our lives.
So don’t call it good unless your hair is known for donating to charity As much as has been raped away from our people How can you expect me to treat their imprint on your language As anything less than equal Let there be no confusion Let there be no hesitation This is not a promotion of ignorance This is a linguistic celebration That’s why I put "tri-lingual" on my last job application
How long is it? Does it have a digit?
Does it have a symbol?
So some people had a pretty easy policy, we call it Basic8, and here the only rule was that your password had to have at least eight characters.
So to give you an idea of how bad guys go about cracking passwords, they will steal a password file that will have all of the passwords in kind of a scrambled form, called a hash, and so what they'll do is they'll make a guess as to what a password is, run it through a hashing function, and see whether it matches the passwords they have on their stolen password list.

He says, in fact, you've already remembered it.
It's called "Security Blanket."
It's the only one that can start a war or say "I love you."
I've been thinking a lot about the world recently and how it's changed over the last 20, 30, 40 years.
Twenty or 30 years ago, if a bank in North America lent too much money to some people who couldn't afford to pay it back and the bank went bust, that was bad for the lender and bad for the borrower, but we didn't imagine it would bring the global economic system to its knees for nearly a decade.
If you look at the downside of globalization, it really does seem to be sometimes overwhelming.
The third reason is hardly worth mentioning because it's so silly, but there's a belief amongst governments that the domestic agenda and the international agenda are incompatible and always will be.
So governments care desperately about the image of their country, because it makes a direct difference to how much money they can make, and that's what they've promised their populations So a couple of years ago, I thought I would take some time out and speak to that gigantic database and ask it, why do some people prefer one country And the answer that the database gave me completely staggered me.

And then you can break down each country in terms of the actual datasets that build into it.
What's it there for?
I think they can change your life, and I think we can use it to change the way that our politicians and our companies behave, and in doing so, we can change the world.
I used to think that I wanted to live in a rich country, and then I started thinking I wanted to live in a happy country, but I began to realize, it's not enough.
He told me that our democracy is a people's democracy, and it can be as great as the people can be, but it is also as fallible as people are.
The Germans were embedded in this mountain hillside, rocky hillside, in impregnable caves, and three allied battalions had been pounding away at it for six months, and they were stalemated.
They are my heroes and my father is my hero, who understood democracy and guided me through it.
When the bus reached the outskirts of her hometown, it was stopped at a checkpoint manned by men from the Armed Islamic Group.
I think I found it in two places.
Now choice, because it's linked to risk, and it was already the famous Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard who pointed out that anxiety is linked to the possibility of possibility.
Or even when ecological crisis already happens, like a catastrophe in Fukushima, often we have people living in the same environment with the same amount of information, and half of them will be anxious about radiation and half of them will ignore it.
Sometimes they don't embrace it, again identifying with the idea of choice, but they have nothing to choose from.
It really prevented us to think about social change.
And the way the surgeon uses this device is that he takes it and he presses it into the abdomen until it punctures through.
But this problem should seem pretty familiar to all of you because I'm pretty sure you've seen it somewhere else.
You knew that at any second that straw was going to plunge through, and you didn't know if it was going to go out the other side and straight into your hand, or if you were going to get juice everywhere, but you were terrified. Right?
You're going to see the sharp bladed tip, and right when it punctures that rubber membrane it's going to disappear into this white blunt sheath.
And because this device is designed to address the physics of puncture and not the specifics of cranial drilling or laparoscopic surgery, or another procedure, it's applicable across these different medical disciplines and across different length scales.
It kept me up at night.
But I think it should fascinate you too, because I said puncture is everywhere.
So if you come across a problem that grabs you, let it keep you up at night.
I would take camera LED lights and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist and I would videotape my belly button, get a different perspective, and see what it does.
The white of the eye and the eyelid will trick the sensor into thinking it's daytime, and it will shut off the light.
It is one of 700 known slime molds belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba.
In its natural habitat, you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands, eating rotting vegetation, but you might equally find it in research laboratories, classrooms, and even artists' studios.
The only instructions I was given, that it likes it dark and damp and its favorite food is porridge oats.
So I was keen to get my new collaborator home to see what it could do.
So I took it home and I watched.
I fed it a varied diet.
I observed as it networked.
It formed a connection between food sources.
I watched it leave a trail behind it, indicating where it had been.
And I noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish, it would escape and find a better home.
When it meets itself, it knows it's already there, it recognizes it's there, and instead retreats back and grows in other directions.
It somehow knew that it was about the time for the cold air that it didn't like.
It fans out in a branching pattern.
As it goes, each food node it finds, it forms a network, a connection to, and keeps foraging.
After 26 hours, it established quite a firm network between the different oats.
Now there's nothing remarkable in this until you learn that the center oat that it started from represents the city of Tokyo, and the surrounding oats are suburban railway stations.
As such, it has been mathematically modeled, algorithmically analyzed.
It's been sonified, replicated, simulated.
It doesn't have a central nervous system.
It doesn't have a brain, yet it can perform behaviors that we associate with brain function.
It can learn, it can remember, it can solve problems, it can make decisions.
And it is this continuous, synchronous oscillation within the cell that allows it to form quite a complex understanding of its environment, but without any large-scale control center.
So people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do, and they design their own petri dish experiment, an environment for the slime mold to navigate so they can test its properties.
It's biologically fascinating, it's computationally interesting, but it's also a symbol, a way of engaging with ideas of community, collective behavior, cooperation.
It's a coproducer of photographs, prints, animations, participatory events.
I can predict certain behaviors by understanding how it operates, but I can't control it.
I can predict certain behaviors by understanding how it operates, but I can't control it.
And after all, it has its own internal aesthetics.
We only offer two programs: business administration and computer science, the two programs that are most in demand worldwide, the two programs that are likeliest they are placed in a small classroom of 20 to 30 students to ensure that those who need personalized attention get it.
There's a problem with this drawing, though, and it's mainly in what it doesn't show.
Proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle, making it separate from the rest of the membrane, and now clathrin is basically done with its job, and so proteins are coming in now — we've covered them yellow and orange — that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage.
It can change the way that we communicate with one another, how we explore our data and how we teach our students.
It's not the worst thing in the world.
It's more than making nice sounds, and it's more than making nice songs.
It's more than feeling known, or understood.
It's more than making you feel the things that I feel.
It is feeling your flaws gut-wrench guillotine your tongue.
It is what you hear when there aren't enough body bags left.
It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege. It is pain.
So we cannot assume that part of the web, part of the deal with the web, is when I use the web, it's just a transparent, neutral medium.
It allows us to talk. Anybody can talk to anybody. It doesn't matter who we are.
It changes the life of the person who receives it, and it changes the life of the person who expresses it.
It changes the life of the person who receives it, and it changes the life of the person who expresses it.
The second site of intervention is also an urban void along the river banks, and it used to be an illegal parking, and we proposed to transform it into the first playground in the medina.
The playground is constructed using recycled tires and also is coupled with a constructed wetland that not only cleans the water of the river but also retains it when floods occur.
And I said, "Well, why? Tell me a little bit about it."
But if an event is potentially devastating, it's worth paying a substantial premium to safeguard against it, even if it's unlikely, just as we take out fire insurance on our house.
When a new particle accelerator came online, some people anxiously asked, could it destroy the Earth or, even worse, rip apart the fabric of space?
It was on news channels across the world.
Everyone was discussing it.
It had over a million views, a thousand comments and shares, and I found myself witnessing a very similar thing.
You see, as a writer, I approached this issue as an Indian, I felt embarrassment and disbelief, and as an activist, I looked at it as a defender of rights, but as a citizen journalist, I suddenly felt very vulnerable.
It's a feeling.
It constantly changes on timescales of seconds to billions of years.
Over the mission lifetime of this telescope, it will detect 40 billion stars and galaxies, and that will be for the first time we'll have detected more objects in our universe than people on the Earth.
But just the idea that the more distant a galaxy, the faster it was receding, was enough to give rise to modern cosmology.
Well, what is dark energy and why does it exist?
Ram Dass says that dependency hurts, but if you accept it, there is less suffering.
Now, it's next door, or in my house.
Why is there a world, why are we in it, and why is there something rather than nothing at all?
He either was or pretended to be an Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook, and he said it's obvious why the world exists: because God created it.
There is no mystery of existence for them. God made it.
If we let our desires melt away, we'll see the world for what it truly is, a vacuity, nothingness, and we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana which has been defined as having just enough life to enjoy being dead.  So that's the Buddhist thinking.
The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout that they can form the abyss, that it's pregnant with being.
It's stupidly constructed, it's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants and mass ratios and superfluous families of elementary particles, and what the hell is dark energy?
It's not an elegant universe.  And then there's the best of all possible worlds in an ethical sense. You should get solemn now, because a world in which sentient beings don't suffer needlessly, in which there aren't things like childhood cancer or the Holocaust.
Nothingness is special. It's the simplest.
It might be instead 100 percent malevolent but only 80 percent effective, which pretty much describes the world we see around us, I think.  So I would like to propose that the resolution to the mystery of existence is that the reality we exist in is one of these generic realities.
While working at Toyota, all I knew was how to make cars until I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki, who came to our factory to make a forest in it in order to make it carbon-neutral.
I've cared for people who live and work in conditions that can be hard, if not harsh, and that work has led me to believe that we need a fundamentally different way of looking at healthcare. We simply need a healthcare system that moves beyond just looking at the symptoms that bring people into clinics, but instead actually is able to look and improve health where it begins.
So what does this different approach to healthcare look like, an approach that can improve health where it begins?
The results are normal, so here's some pain medication, and follow up with a primary care doctor, but if the pain persists or if it worsens, then come on back."
I received that chart in hand, reviewed it, and I turned the handle on the door and I entered the room.
It's going to lower your risk of death from heart disease."
And what can we do together to improve my health where it begins?
We can improve health where it begins.
It's called prosopagnosia, and it results from damage to a particular part of the brain.
So this picture's nice, if I do say so myself, but it shows only anatomy.
Now this image looks just awful by today's standards, but at the time I thought it was beautiful.
What it shows is that region right there, that little blob, it's about the size of an olive and it's on the bottom surface of my brain about an inch straight in from right there.
Is it really specialized just for face recognition?
Maybe it responds not only to faces but to any body part.
Maybe it responds to anything human or anything alive or anything round.
We want to see the whole thing, so let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing.
In fact, a few years ago, there was a scientist in my lab who became quite convinced that he'd found a brain region for detecting food, and it responded really strongly in the scanner when people looked at images like this.
Many people justify the high cost of neuroscience research by pointing out that it may help us someday to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism.
Did it almost double, did it remain more or less the same, or did it halve?
Give it to them and measure what the media know."
Okay, this was good evolutionarily, but now when it comes to the worldview, it is the exact reason why it's upside down.
The trends that are increasing are instead falling, and the other way around, and in this case, the chimps use our intuition against us, and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength.
Well, we turn it into a knowledge certificate, a global knowledge certificate, which you can use, if you're a large organization, a school, a university, or maybe a news agency, to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable.
Do you see the big hump? Did you see how it moved?
And so, on the last day of camp, I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe from the grocery store and I hid it in the ivy, and then at lunchtime, I was like, "Riley, why don't you go over there and see what you've done."
I'm going to call it wonder.
It's called "Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem."
And it's about a kid who gets a blue whale as a pet but it's a punishment and it ruins his life.
So it's delivered overnight by FedUp.
Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle, it was a safe and easy way to get around.
Over the next 20 years, perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so.
We have to invest strongly in energy, we have to use it much more efficiently, and we have to make it clean.
We can recognize the problem, but we can also understand how to tackle it.
They dated it from 2000 B.C., so it's 4,000 years old.
They dated it from 2000 B.C., so it's 4,000 years old.
If you have a cell phone, and that cell phone has GPS, but even if it doesn't have GPS, it can record your information.
It plays itself. It collects more data.
It collects more data. It increases the accuracy of its prediction.
And then Arthur Samuel goes back to the computer and he plays it, and he loses, and he plays it, and he loses, and he plays it, and he loses, and Arthur Samuel has created a machine that surpasses his ability in a task that he taught it.
Researchers recently have looked at the question of biopsies, cancerous biopsies, and they've asked the computer to identify by looking at the data and survival rates to determine whether cells are actually cancerous or not, and sure enough, when you throw the data at it, through a machine-learning algorithm, the machine was able to identify the 12 telltale signs that best predict that this biopsy of the breast cancer cells are indeed cancerous.
Humanity can finally learn from the information that it can collect, as part of our timeless quest to understand the world and our place in it, and that's why big data is a big deal.
If you are like most people, death might be Some of us will see it coming.
Whether they call it sin or they simply say they have a regret, their guilt is universal.
And it is a big problem: There are 2.5 billion people in the world who don't have access to adequate sanitation.
And if you're living in fecal material and it's surrounding you, you're going to get sick.
It's going to get into your drinking water, into your food, into your immediate surroundings.
Because essentially, what you're doing is you're using clean water and you're using it to flush your toilet, convey it to a wastewater treatment plant which then discharges to a river, and that river, again, is a drinking water source.
With an architect's help, residents literally raised it from the ground up.
In other words, this skill set has to do with understanding where the organization is going, what its strategy is, what financial targets it has in place, and understanding your role in moving the organization forward.
So I asked, "Well, what about people who understand your business, where it's going, and their role in taking it there?
So I asked, "Well, what about people who understand your business, where it's going, and their role in taking it there?
What it means is that this is advice that's absolutely essential for breaking through from career start to middle management, but it's not the advice that gets women to break through from the middle, where we're 50 percent, to senior and executive positions.
And if you think about what I've just shared, that you have situations where at least 50 percent of your middle managers haven't received clear messaging that they have to become focused on the business, where it's headed, and their role in taking it there, it's not surprising that that percentage of executives who are confident about alignment is so low, which is why there are other people who have a role to play in this.
Why? Because if they aren't seeing that, it could be a red flag that their organization isn't as aligned as it could potentially be.
It's a very desolate place.
Human shame is a very powerful motivator, as is the desire to avoid it, and that's the reason why people, when they're in a state of being watched, make decisions not that are the byproduct of their own agency but that are about the expectations that others have of them or the mandates of societal orthodoxy.
Equally critical is that the measure of how free a society is is not how it treats its good, obedient, compliant citizens, but how it treats its dissidents and those who resist orthodoxy.
It renders off-limits all kinds of behavioral choices without our even knowing that it's happened.
We can try and render the chains of mass surveillance invisible or undetectable, but the constraints that it imposes on us do not become any less potent.
Her school actually ranks among the best public schools in the country, and it was going to be demolished by the Rio de Janeiro state government to build, I kid you not, a parking lot for the World Cup right before the event happened.
His parents think sometimes it's a precious commodity, so they'll keep it in a cupboard.
They'll keep it away from him so he doesn't waste it.
A hundred and eighteen years later, the solution is exactly the same: It's about ensuring that they have access to this bar of soap, and that they're using it, because that's the number one way to actually stop cholera from spreading.
As you might know, proteins are large biological molecules that perform different functions within our body, like catalyzing metabolic reactions or responding to stimuli or replicating DNA, but before a protein is expressed or produced, relevant parts of its genetic code present in the DNA are copied into the messenger RNA, so this messenger RNA has instructions on how to build a specific protein, and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins,
It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes.
Several scientific studies have shown that abnormal microRNA expression levels varies and creates a unique, specific pattern for each type of cancer, even at the early stages, reflecting the progression of the disease, and whether it's responding to medication or in remission, making microRNAs a perfect, highly sensitive biomarker.
Imagine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test, a lab technician extracts a total RNA, which is quite simple today, and puts it in a standard 96-well plate like this one.
A smartphone is a connected computer and it's also a camera, good enough for our purpose.
The smartphone is taking pictures, and when the reaction is over, it will send the pictures to our online database for processing and interpretation.
It not only costs us billions of dollars, but it also costs us the people we love.
It will give us the chance of detecting it early, understanding it better, and finding a cure.
But it also taps into a lot of our deepest fears, and about 30 years ago, the culture critic Neil Postman wrote a book called "Amusing Ourselves to Death," which lays this out really brilliantly.
And what I admire and appreciate about this project, aside from the fact, including the fact is that it's a fantastic example of courage in the face of a sea of irrelevance.
And the diagnosis was factually correct, but it didn't tell the whole story.
Because after all, if I can spot a problem in an argument, it doesn't much matter whether it's expressed in words or in numbers.
It had shattered into pieces.
I think I'd like to stay in it forever."  Well, you just can.
The prizes are based on just one criteria. It's very simple.
She came to the Ig Nobel ceremony with the first prototype of the bra and she demonstrated:   ["Paul Krugman, Nobel laureate  in economics"] ["Wolfgang Ketterle, Nobel laureate  in physics"] I myself own an emergency bra.  It's my favorite bra, but I would be happy to share it with any of you, should the need arise.

Of course, just like any neighbor, after a while, if they get tired, the goliath grouper barks at us, and this bark is so powerful that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all within a split second.
It gives us an insight into some of the animals that we were sitting right next to for 31 days and never normally would have paid attention to, such as hermit crabs.
We sometimes had to put the camera upside down, cordon it back to the lab, and actually man the trigger from the lab itself.
And no one really knew how significant these protests were, because, for whatever reason, the world media largely ignored it.
It's quite heavy, lots of spinning, sharp things.
It's literally a dog leash. It's very convenient.
And the neat thing about it is, to fly it, there's no joysticks, nothing like this.
What's more, it tells you immediately that I am the one responsible for this device.
You don't have to look for someone controlling it.
And in fact, I thought, well, if you have to have cancer, it's pretty convenient to be working at a place that treats it.
Don't let it claim you.
Don't let it claim you.
Don't let it claim you, because if you do, I believe you will become trapped, you will not grow, you will not evolve.
Claim your experience. Don't let it claim you.
What if there were no survivors, meaning, what if people decided to just claim their trauma as an experience instead of taking it on as an identity?
The government had a military strategy, it had a political strategy, but it said, "We don't really have a communications strategy, and it probably would be a good thing to have," so we decided to immediately jump into this, because it is an opportunity to affect the outcome of the conflict with the things that we do, with the tools that we have.
We didn't understand in Colombia, if you live in the cities, you're very far away from where the war is actually happening, so you don't really understand it, and we asked the government to give us access to as many demobilized guerrillas as possible.
The problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla.
It was not working with the commanders, the people that are more difficult to replace, because you can easily recruit but you can't get the older commanders.
As a building, it could pay for expensive, well-located land, and as a house, it could expand.
It's a collection of floors, one on top of each other, with a core in the center with elevators, stairs, pipes, wires, everything, and then a glass skin on the outside that, due to direct sun radiation, creates a huge greenhouse effect inside.
It is actually —  It is actually not even with the families trying to find the right answer.
It's poor and it's scarce.
What if, in between the city and the sea we have a forest, a forest that doesn't try to resist the energy of nature, but dissipates it by introducing friction?
It is life itself.
Now, with marijuana, that obviously means legally regulating and taxing it like alcohol.
Maybe, but it's not going to be young people, because it's not going to be legalized for them, and quite frankly, they already have the best access to marijuana.
But the second challenge is tougher, because it's about us.
VM: I think you break it with your body, more than with your knowledge.
VM: It was amongst the first ones in Brazil, yeah.
Over the next few days, his head was swollen with abscesses, and in fact his eye was so infected that they had to take it out, and by February of 1941, this poor man was on the verge of dying.
They were starting to run out of penicillin, so what they would do was run with his urine across the road to re-synthesize the penicillin from his urine and give it back to him, and that worked.
It's a global issue affecting both rich and poor countries, and at the heart of it, you might say, well, isn't this really just a medical issue?
It's a fairly cheap drug.
She tried to look up her oncologist's phone number on the Internet and she found it, but she found something else too.
And three years later, it's still getting thousands of views every month.
It's right at our fingertips, literally.
Here's how No MAS works. It's very simple.
So now, what I've been working on for the last four years is to develop smart biomaterials, which are actually materials that will work with the body, helping it to heal and helping it to allow the wounds to heal normally.
It allows them to feel what they're doing, where they are, and tells them how to act and how to behave.
So that means if you put it onto liver, it turns into something that looks like liver, and if you put it onto skin, it turns into something that looks just like skin.
So that means if you put it onto liver, it turns into something that looks like liver, and if you put it onto skin, it turns into something that looks just like skin.
Now, in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself, our material is able to stop that bleed, and it's because it actually goes on and works with the body to heal, so it reassembles into this piece of meat, and then the blood actually recognizes that that's happening, and produces fibrin, producing a very fast clot in less than 10 seconds.
So now this technology, by January, will be in the hands of veterinarians, and we're working very diligently to try to get it into the hands of doctors, hopefully within the next year.
He walked over to a palm tree and carved off a fern, threw it in the fire, applied it to my foot, threw it in a pot of water, and had me drink the tea.
When it came back, I went to see the shaman again.
But as you all know, it's rapidly disappearing.
Top half carbon sequestered in the forest where it belongs, bottom half carbon in the atmosphere where it's driving climate change.
And if it looks like this picture is out of focus because it was taken in a hurry, here's why.
But let me conclude by saying, this work can be spiritually rewarding, but it's difficult and it can be dangerous.
It gives me time to speak with each person and to look at them, in silence, while they look back at me.
It will fit for the 2,000 train spotters in Norway.
We brought it on air in November 2009.
It belongs to a guy called Erik Hansen.
And it's people like those two who took a firm grip of our program, and together with thousands of others along the route, they made the program what it became.
We turned it into a complete TV control room.
It made it possible for us to take close-up pictures of people 100 kilomteres away, like this one.  People called us and asked, how is this man doing?
So we could either take something long and make it a topic, like with the railway and the Hurtigruten, or we could take a topic and make it long.
But this is Slow TV, so you have to keep this picture until it really starts hurting your stomach, and then you keep it a little bit longer, and when you keep it that long, I'm sure some of you now have noticed the cow.
But this is Slow TV, so you have to keep this picture until it really starts hurting your stomach, and then you keep it a little bit longer, and when you keep it that long, I'm sure some of you now have noticed the cow.
So my point is, the longer you keep a picture like this, and we kept it for 10 minutes, you start making the stories in your own head.
When people smile, it might be a very good slow idea, so after all, life is best when it's a bit strange.
The reason it's happening is because, as the cost of storing this data has plummeted, the police departments simply hang on to it, just in case it could be useful someday.
Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it's not there.
Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it's not there.
["Evict Twitter"] Somebody sent me this photo a few weeks ago, and it shows what is happening on the ground in San Francisco, and I think you can actually try to understand that through looking at a map like this.
So my favorite online dating website is OkCupid, not least because it was started by a group of mathematicians.
He said, "Dear Professor Dweck, I appreciate that your writing is based on solid scientific research, and that's why I decided to put it into practice.
You never had to be taught this rule, you just understand it.
You can take a word and you can kind of squish it down a little bit.
Can it bring down walls? Yes.
You cook it with rice and chicken, and you flip it upside-down.
It's the best meal ever.
It sent me over Mass. Ave., Massachusetts Avenue, the shortest route from Boston to Cambridge.
Poetry does that; it sews up the wounds of exclusion.
It opens doors. Poetry works as a mirror.
Martín Bustamante: The heart chews tears of time; blinded by that light, it hides the speed of existence where the images go rowing by.
When we find the grave, we take out the dirt and eventually clean the body, document it, and exhume it.
So the question is, okay, altruism is the answer, it's not just a novel ideal, but can it be a real, pragmatic solution?
Two thousand years of contemplative study said yes, it is.
It shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain without tipping over, and it's able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials, which is what we traditionally use to make robots, and soft materials.
And it survives, bounces on the table, it's incredibly robust, and of course survives quite well until we lose it because it's very tiny.
And it survives, bounces on the table, it's incredibly robust, and of course survives quite well until we lose it because it's very tiny.
So this is a micro-fabricated energetic material, and we can create tiny pixels of this, and we can put one of these pixels on the belly of this robot, and this robot, then, is going to jump when it senses an increase in light.
It's only four by four by seven millimeters in size.
And a brain-machine interface is not rocket science, it's just brain research.
What you're listening to is the sound of the brain of this monkey as it explores three different visually identical spheres in virtual space.
We got it out of the drawers, and we proposed that perhaps we could get a human being that is paralyzed to actually use the brain-machine interface to regain mobility.
Of course, he will have it whenever he wants.
It can receive thoughts and it can deliver feedback, and when Juliano makes the decision to kick the ball, you are going to see two streams of green and yellow light coming from the helmet and going to the legs, representing the mental commands that were taken by the exo to actually make that happen.
So if I'm understanding correctly, one of the monkeys is actually getting a signal and the other monkey is reacting to that signal just because the first one is receiving it and transmitting the neurological impulse.
Now, if you flip without telling the monkey the dimensions that each brain has to control, like this guy is controlling x and y, but he should be controlling now y and z, instantaneously, that animal's brain forgets about the old dimensions and it starts concentrating on the new dimensions.
But after the food goes through the digestive system, when it is thrown out as crap, it is no longer fashionable to speak about it.
And when it is full, it is blocked and it can go to the next.
It is always a 24-hour water supply because water gets polluted very often when you store it -- a child dips his or her hand into it, something falls into it.
It happens right here, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
It has caused almost four million deaths.
It has destabilized most of Central Africa for the past 18 years.
And I was one of these people, and I shared this culture, so I know all too well how powerful it is.
Now again, what's interesting about this myth is that although it's basically a myth, there is a grain of truth to it.
But in fact, what happens is that if you analyze the pattern of hits and misses statistically, it turns out that it's nearly always at random.
I've tested the device on my grandfather for about a year now, and it's had a 100 percent success rate in detecting the over 900 known cases of his wandering.
It makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do.
Loneliness won't just make you miserable, it will kill you.
It even suppress the functioning of your immune system, making you vulnerable to all kinds of illnesses and diseases.
The little boy next to her watched this happen, then turned to his box and and burst into tears without even touching it.
And you have to break this kind of negative cycle before it begins.
Why would we want to go and damage it even further?
So when you get rejected, the first thing you should be doing is to revive your self-esteem, not join Fight Club and beat it into a pulp.
And your journey is simple -- it's made of steps.
Although they very carefully preserved the stomach, the lungs, the liver, and so forth, they just mushed up the brain, drained it out through the nose, and threw it away, which makes sense, really, because what does a brain do for us anyway?
The place where this was recorded was in fact a gibbon reserve, which is why you can hear so many of them, but in fact the most important noise that was coming out of the forest that time was one that I didn't notice, and in fact nobody there had actually noticed it.
It's the second highest contributor to climate change.
The moment a sound of a chainsaw is heard in the forest, the device picks up the sound of the chainsaw, it sends an alert through the standard GSM network that's already there to a ranger in the field who can in fact show up in real time and stop the logging.
then we believe it's an entirely upcycled device.
What you are sending, in many ways, is actually a postcard, and it's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can actually read the entire contents.
What you are sending, in many ways, is actually a postcard, and it's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets to the recipient can actually read the entire contents.
If we want to have privacy online, what we have to do is we've got to go out and get it ourselves.
So the key challenge is to take Bob's message and to get it to Alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message.
So what we have to do is we have to encrypt it before it even leaves Bob's computer, and one of the tricks is, we encrypt it using the public key from Alice.
So what we have to do is we have to encrypt it before it even leaves Bob's computer, and one of the tricks is, we encrypt it using the public key from Alice.
And that's actually the key design challenge: How do we take all this complexity, all this software, and implement it in a way that the user cannot see it.
Go ahead, throw it in any direction so that you can find someone else at random.
So you have the giraffe, go ahead, throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random.
Do you have it?
Now, I want you to take the bill and fold it like this, lengthwise, so it becomes like a rectangle, and then again -- really fold it, really crease it -- and when you have it, please fold the bill again into a little square like this and let me know when you have it.
So even if nobody comes onstage and switches the bill, I don't have enough time to go open the bill and close it and see what I don't want to see.
How about something like a roulette game, where you try the hat on one by one, and then, when someone puts it on, a scary alien breaks through the top screaming, "Ahh!"
I was going to call it "Prime Time Loving."
Only you can choose to dim it, and the sky is the limit, so silence the critics by burning.” And if eyes are windows to the soul then she drew back the curtains And let the sun shine through the hurting.
It has these courtyards in the middle so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air, and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings, so they just feel more comfortable to be in.
And it's also beautiful.
I dedicated the program to my dad, it changed my relationship with him, and it changed my life.
Sarah Littman: I think it would be an eight without animals, because they add so much pleasure to life.
My company, called Freelance Programmers, and that's precisely what it was, couldn't have started smaller: on the dining room table, and financed by the equivalent of 100 dollars in today's terms, and financed by my labor and by borrowing against the house.
And later, as it became sizable, they accepted, "Yes, it is sizable now, but of no strategic interest."
But in my case, it came in the midst of family trauma and indeed, crisis.
I believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility.
And then, on top of that, the Chinese to this day believe that the United States and the West do not accept the legitimacy of their political system because it's so radically different from those of us who come from liberal democracies, and believe that the United States to this day is seeking to undermine their political system.
Furthermore, the United States says that the Chinese political system is fundamentally wrong because it's at such fundamental variance to the human rights, democracy, and rule of law that we enjoy in the U.S. and the collective West.
And I'm essentially taking a piece of your history and putting it inside the framing of the story.
He said a just society is a society that if you knew everything about it, you would be willing to enter it in a random place.
The issue of asylum seekers in Australia has been so extremely politicized that it has lost its human face.
He will come back eventually, because it's a circle, it comes back.
It's much more like an animal call than it is like speech.
It's been well-described and well-observed in primates, but you also see it in rats, and wherever you find it -- humans, primates, rats -- you find it associated with things like tickling.
You find it associated with play, and all mammals play.
And wherever you find it, it's associated with interactions.
The fact that the laughter works, it gets him from a painful, embarrassing, difficult situation, into a funny situation, into what we're actually enjoying there, and I think that's a really interesting use, and it's actually happening all the time.
But then I found out, it already is.
I'm not going to turn it on yet, so go ahead and give it a squeeze.
Now, the diagram that you see here, I know it looks like some kind of sports play, but it is actually a blueprint of the first bacterial program I developed.
You can observe quorum sensing in action in this movie, where a growing colony of bacteria only begins to glow once it reaches a high or critical density.
This particular movie and experiment we call The Supernova, because it looks like an exploding star.
It's so far underwater right now, the only part that's showing pretty much is the cabin.
She sings this song. It's called "Dear Heart."
We took this wild creature and put it inside of a box, practically domesticating it, and originally that was so that we could harvest their honey, but over time we started losing our native pollinators, our wild pollinators, and there are many places now where those wild pollinators can no longer meet the pollination demands of our agriculture, so these managed bees have become an integral part of our food system.
It's built almost entirely from bamboo.
Treat it properly, design it carefully, and a bamboo structure can last a lifetime.
Well, its hinges battle with gravity, and gravity will always win in the end, so why not have it pivot on the center where it can stay balanced?
But if what you've got is skilled craftsmen and itsy bitsy little splits, weave that ceiling together, stretch a canvas over it, lacquer it.
It is beautiful, gold standard. Love it.
The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.
It is everywhere; every municipal building flies the flag.
RM: Okay. So when I moved back to San Francisco in 2008, I researched its flag, because I had never seen it in the previous eight years I lived there.
And I found it, I am sorry to say, sadly lacking.
Design-wise, it manages to both be too crude and have too many details at the same time, which if you were trying for that, you wouldn't be able to do it, and it just looks bad at a distance, but having deep meaning puts that element in the plus column.
And because it's so badass, those flags and crosses are found throughout Amsterdam, just like Chicago, they're used.
Take the name off, and the border might even be made thicker, so it's more a part of the flag.
And I would simply take the phoenix and make it a great big element in the middle of the flag.
If you see your city flag and like it, fly it, even if it violates a design rule or two.
If you see your city flag and like it, fly it, even if it violates a design rule or two.
But if you don't see your city flag, maybe it doesn't exist, but maybe it does, and it just sucks, and I dare you to join the effort to try to change that.
It's a thing. It's a legal thing.
On June 22, 1772, Lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious, and he used the word "odious," that the common law would not support it, and he ordered James free.
It makes us suddenly aware of everything in the environment.
It brutally draws us in to a virtual sensory awareness of the world much like meditation."
It was taken off six weeks later, but even then, I couldn't extend my elbow, and I had to do physical therapy to flex and extend it, 100 times per day, seven days per week.
What is that made of, and how much does it cost?
It's somewhat warm.
And it starts with a problem of confounded evidence that all of us have, which is that we are part of the world.
But the important point here is it provides a little bit of evidence that the problem isn't with the toy, it's with the person.
It was a behavior system -- designed to promote positive behavior at all times.
It had nothing to do with hating my body, I just love it enough to let it go, I treat it like a house, and when your house is falling apart, you do not evacuate, you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides, you make it pretty enough to invite guests over, you make the floorboards strong enough to stand on.

No one ever thinks of us as human because we are more ghost than flesh, because people fear that my gender expression is a trick, that it exists to be perverse, that it ensnares them without their consent, that my body is a feast for their eyes and hands and once they have fed off my queer, they'll regurgitate all the parts they did not like.
I'm also going to talk to you a little bit about our car and allow you to see how it sees the world and how it reacts and what it does, but first I'm going to talk a little bit about the problem.
And it's a big problem: 1.2 million people are killed on the world's roads every year.
And we gave them the car and we allowed them to use it in their daily lives.
And so we gave them two hours of training, we put them in the car, we let them use it, and what we heard back was something awesome, as someone trying to bring a product into the world.
Every one of them told us they loved it.
But at the end of it, he said, "Not only should I have it, everyone else should have it, because people are terrible drivers."
Now, my favorite story is this gentleman who looks down at his phone and realizes the battery is low, so he turns around like this in the car and digs around in his backpack, pulls out his laptop, puts it on the seat, goes in the back again, digs around, pulls out the charging cable for his phone, futzes around, puts it into the laptop, puts it on the phone.

So we're looking at this graph, and along the bottom is how often does the car apply the brakes when it shouldn't.
It doesn't apply the brakes for you, it doesn't do anything goofy, but it also doesn't get you out of an accident.
We're going to have to put more sensors in the vehicle, and we'll pick some operating point up here where it basically never gets into a crash.
I can't tell, nor can any of our algorithms, but in the case of a driver assistance system, that means it can't take action, because again, if it presses the brakes unexpectedly, that's completely unacceptable.
It starts by understanding where it is in the world, by taking a map and its sensor data and aligning the two, and then we layer on top of that what it sees in the moment.
So here the pickup truck in top right is about to make a left lane change because the road in front of it is closed, so it needs to get out of the way.
So here the pickup truck in top right is about to make a left lane change because the road in front of it is closed, so it needs to get out of the way.
And then given that, we can figure out how the car should respond in the moment, so what trajectory it should follow, how quickly it should slow down or speed up.
The car needs to understand where it is and roughly where the other vehicles are.
It was one of the most exciting games in basketball.
It gives me the strength and conviction to do my work every day.
We think, because there are chemical hooks in heroin, as you took it for a while, your body would become dependent on those hooks, you'd start to physically need them, and at the end of those 20 days, you'd all be heroin addicts. Right?
First thing that alerted me to the fact that something's not right with this story is when it was explained to me.
You get a rat and you put it in a cage, and you give it two water bottles: One is just water, and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine.
They almost never use it.
None of them ever use it compulsively.
One of the ways you know it's worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal wants to go back to the old system.
and weird to say it's growing, because you think we're the most connected society that's ever been, surely.
What is real love? How does it work?
Now, the gift is very nutritious, and the female eats it during and after mating.
So, the bigger it is, the better off the male is, because that means more time for his sperm to drain into her body and fertilize her eggs.
While I was in the hospital, I asked for a printed-out picture of my cancer and I spoke with it.
I talked to it and I said, "Okay, cancer, you're not all there is to me.
In our Western cultures, it means eradicating or reversing a disease, but in different cultures, for example, a culture from Asia, from the Mediterranean, from Latin countries, from Africa, it can mean many more things.
Or, as artist Patrick Lichty has done: He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on Thingiverse.
I think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes.
There is a beauty in it that you don't need to translate.
In Rio de Janeiro, I translated this Portuguese poem from Gabriela Tôrres Barbosa, who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela, and then I painted it on the rooftop.
I'm really proud of my culture, and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork.
I don't want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken, as it's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning, as you can enjoy any music from other countries.
Agloe, New York, is very famous to cartographers, because it's a paper town.
I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets, and I learned that iambic pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears.
But, you might ask, why was the Higgs boson included in the standard model, alongside well-known particles like electrons and photons and quarks, if it hadn't been discovered back then in the 1970s?
In particular, the Higgs field helps explain why it's so weak.
Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle of savage, destructive nihilism."] I really believe that these spaces, these communities, have become for a new generation of learners, the kind of communities, the kind of cartographic communities that I had when I was in high school, and then again when I was in college.
And please open it.
You can see it, you can touch it, you can ever smell it.
Again, money is not an objective reality; it has no objective value.
It is actually worth 10 bananas."
Money, in fact, is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans, because it is the only story everybody believes.
You have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your side or the other side, by good guys, or by bad guys.
Quantum biology brings together quantum physicists, biochemists, molecular biologists -- it's a very interdisciplinary field.
After all, it gives us the rules that tell us how the atoms fit together to make organic molecules.
You see, this weirdness is very delicate; and we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs.
It influenced Francis Crick and James Watson, the discoverers of the double-helix structure of DNA.
The nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall, you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall.
In the quantum world, you don't have to throw it over the wall, you can throw it at the wall, and there's a certain non-zero probability that it'll disappear on your side, and reappear on the other.
In the quantum world, you don't have to throw it over the wall, you can throw it at the wall, and there's a certain non-zero probability that it'll disappear on your side, and reappear on the other.
We still don't know yet how important it is; this is still an open question.
It's also still very speculative, but I have to share it with you.
Now, the Earth's magnetic field is very, very weak; it's 100 times weaker than a fridge magnet, and yet it affects the chemistry -- somehow -- within a living organism.
Well, the only theory in town -- we don't know if it's the correct theory, but the only theory in town -- is that it does it via something called quantum entanglement.
Well, the only theory in town -- we don't know if it's the correct theory, but the only theory in town -- is that it does it via something called quantum entanglement.
It's still speculative.
But I believe it's built on solid science.
I also think that in the coming decade or so, we're going to start to see that actually, it pervades life -- that life has evolved tricks that utilize the quantum world.
And it does this by encrypting your IP address and then routing it via several other computers around the world that use the same software.
And the reason is, because although innovation, of course, takes place in big businesses, takes place in world-class universities, it also takes place in the fringes, because those on the fringes -- the pariahs, the outcasts -- they're often the most creative, because they have to be.
The vendor, who would see that I'd sent it, would be confident that they could then send the product to me, and then when I received it, at least two of the three people engaged in the transaction -- vendor, buyer, site administrator -- would have to sign the transaction off with a unique digital signature, and then the money would be transferred.
It's easy to forget that because of its short life, the Internet has actually changed many times It started in the '70s as a military project, morphed in the 1980s to an academic network, co-opted by commercial companies in the '90s, and then invaded by all of us via social media in the noughties, but I think it's going to change again.
We use it for everything from Skype to the search for extraterrestrial life.
And if we're lucky, it might even be important.
With things, if the technology sucks, it just vanishes, right?
So let's try it.
We can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it.
I love this bird because it's a swamp bird, through and through, a swamp bird.
So what happens, then, when this bird flies over the Gulf of Mexico into Central America for the winter and then the spring rolls around and it flies back, and it comes back to this: a freshly sodded golf course?
So sure, the national park is the southern end of this system, but all the things that make it unique are these inputs that come in, the fresh water that starts 100 miles north.
And he gets right over the trap, and I see that he's seen it.
But what the idea was, is that for someone who's never seen this bird and has no reason to care about it, these photos, these new perspectives, that makes this watershed so incredible, so valuable, so important.
Because if we can heal this system, it's going to become an icon for wetland restoration all over the world.
I love that quote, because it's a challenge, it's a prod.
And as a poet, I began working with this subject matter, finding it tragic, hilarious, sometimes even joyful.
"No Signs of Struggle" Growing small requires enormity of will: just sitting still in the doctor's waiting room watching the future shuffle in and out, watching it stoop; stare at you while you try not to look.
Odd that the modest brain never imagined its unique value in research, maybe saving someone else from what it is they're not quite sure I have.
Our tragedy is we can't see it.
It transformed me. It gave me status.
It gave me confidence. It gave me a career.
It helped me to support my family, to bring my family to another country, to be safe.
It was a beautiful country, beautiful, peaceful country.
I remember staring out the window as my dad drove me home from work, thinking I have so much love inside of me and nobody to give it to.
Or is it really just about aerobic exercise, getting oxygen to the brain?
Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise?
In fact, the model is so simple that you could summarize it in six words: have disease, take pill, kill something.
So seductive was this idea, so potent the metaphor of lock and key and killing something, that it really swept through biology.
And it's worked, but it's only worked partly.
It actually grows in a human organism.
And we now know that what you really probably need to do is to change the physiology of the organ, the brain, rewire it, remodel it, and that, of course, we know study upon study has shown that talk therapy does exactly that, and study upon study has shown that talk therapy combined with medicines, pills, really is much more effective than either one alone.
How does it link in?
Economic growth seems to have really helped in the fight against poverty, but it doesn't seem to be having much impact on trying to get to the Global Goals.
Even a flood tide of economic growth is not going to get us there, if it just raises the mega-yachts and the super-wealthy and leaves the rest behind.
It was grey and black, and he thought it looked cheap.
It was grey and black, and he thought it looked cheap.
We heard this story, and it triggered me and my colleague, photographer Tomm Christiansen, and we of course had the obvious question: who were these people?
To me, this is a story about two questions that I think we all share: what is a better life, and what am I willing to do to achieve it?
It's a life in dignity.
It seemed more permanent, NGOs have arrived, a small school has opened.
What I want to do now is tell you what the CRISPR technology is, what it can do, where we are today and why I think we need to take a prudent path forward in the way that we employ this technology.
It makes a very precise break.
And importantly, this complex is programmable, so it can be programmed to recognize particular DNA sequences, and make a break in the DNA at that site.
So when a plant or an animal cell detects a double-stranded break in its DNA, it can fix that break, either by pasting together the ends of the broken DNA with a little, tiny change in the sequence of that position, or it can repair the break by integrating a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut.
So, the opportunity to take a technology like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal, because of its relative simplicity.
And when we sequence the DNA from these animals, we find that the change in the DNA has occurred at exactly the place where we induced it, using the CRISPR technology. Additional experiments are going on in other animals that are useful for creating models for human disease, And here we find that we can use these systems to test the application of this technology in particular tissues, for example, figuring out how to deliver the CRISPR tool into cells.
In my view, such an extension of the Internet can only work if it's almost energy-neutral.
If I turn it off, we see it drops.
I turn it on ...
What's really important here is that a solar cell has become a receiver for high-speed wireless signals encoded in light, while it maintains its primary function as an energy-harvesting device.
And people published it very, very purposefully, to get it up there in the search results.
It reminds one of biology classes, if you remember the human body with all its organs and circulatory systems, like at school.
With 473,000 square meters, it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world.
It is there.
It has also become a very popular backdrop for wedding photography.
It is the story of the people that made it -- 400 engineers and architects that I was guiding over almost a decade of collaborative work that we spent together in scripting this building, in imagining its reality and ultimately getting it built in China.
And, in fact, it was a system where we would layer primarily communal spaces, stacked to more and more individual and private spaces.
It both shows the enormous scale and potential of the project, but also the difference: here, it is a multiplicity of a heterogeneous structure, in which different entities can interact without losing their own identity.
And after the moment of transmission, it's gone forever.
The irony in all of this, of course, is that having just carefully classified all of the signs into a single category, I have a feeling that my next step will involve breaking it back apart as different types of imagery are identified and separated off.
It ends with a special technique called the carp, which allows me to store one to two extra liters of air in my lungs by compressing it.
The more you try to control it, the harder it is to manage.
The more you try to control it, the harder it is to manage.
It's about being at ease in the water.
It's extremely beautiful, very poetic and artistic.
It's already with us.
It comes with the winds, it comes with the swells, and so they can be magnified, but what we are beginning to witness is the change in the weather pattern, which is perhaps the more urgent challenge that we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level.
I said, What about the rest? Why don't you keep it?
And somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple.
And in my point, if you talk about immaterial art, music is the highest -- absolutely highest art of all, because it's the most immaterial.
It turns out, if you want to read the world, if you want to encounter it with an open mind, the world will help you.
Whether I see it in a tweet, in a news headline or the glossy pages of a conservation brochure, that phrase bothers me, because we as conservationists have been sounding the alarms about the death of coral reefs for decades.
How would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs when it's an abstract thing they can barely understand?
If they don't understand what a coral is or where it comes from, or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is, why would we expect them to care about saving them?
What is a coral and where does it come from?
So in the research I do with my colleagues in Curaçao, we try to figure out what a baby coral needs in that critical early stage, what it's looking for and how we can try to help it through that process.
So in the research I do with my colleagues in Curaçao, we try to figure out what a baby coral needs in that critical early stage, what it's looking for and how we can try to help it through that process.
It's growing at something like seven percent per year.
Sometimes it increased very rapidly, then there was a plateau, then it increased rapidly.
It also acts to transport heat across the equator, and the ocean is full of nutrients and it controls primary productivity.
It's called a pyrosome or colonial tunicate, if you like.
It's just a still taken out of that first piece of footage that I showed you.
It's because our friendships -- female friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood, and sisterhood can be a very powerful force, to give the world -- to make it what it should be -- the things that humans desperately need.
It's because our friendships -- female friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood, and sisterhood can be a very powerful force, to give the world -- to make it what it should be -- the things that humans desperately need.
And gender equality, it's like a tide, it would lift all boats, not just women.
So I think there's a real danger that we never really see the sea, and if we don't really see it, if it doesn't have its own iconography, if we miss its majesty, then there's a big danger that we take it for granted.
It's thanks to relativity and quantum mechanics that we've learned what the universe is made from, how it began and how it continues to evolve.
It should be dark, lethal and lifeless.
And the Higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field, except it has a constant value everywhere.
It's all around us right now.
We can't see it or touch it, but if it wasn't there, we would not exist.
We can't see it or touch it, but if it wasn't there, we would not exist.
If it wasn't there, those particles would have no mass, and no atoms could form and there would be no us.
If it were a tiny bit different, then there would be no physical structure in the universe.
Theorists have spent decades trying to understand why it has this very peculiarly fine-tuned number, and they've come up with a number of possible explanations.
It's a thousand trillion trillion trillion times bigger than the number of atoms in the entire universe.
It is clear that the world today is much more dangerous than it was.
I anonymously created a Facebook page and called it "We are all Khaled Said."
It had more fans than established media organizations and even top celebrities.
It was lit only by the dim, green glow of the emergency exit sign.
It wouldn't create the volume that would fill a large space such as the Cologne Opera House.
He had embraced that mess, and it soared.
If there was a television on while they were doing their essays, they couldn't screen it out.
And the groups of four students were asked to figure out who did it, who committed the crime.
But the thing is it was a pretty good album, but also, Carlos Alomar, 35 years later, now uses The Oblique Strategies.
And it was dropping at such a rate that it would have left the drinking water intakes for Las Vegas high and dry.
And even if we succeed in grabbing the water from our rural neighbors, we're just transferring the problem to someone else and there's a good chance it will come back and bite us in the form of higher food prices and damage to the aquatic ecosystems that already rely upon that water.
And if the water's still not clean enough to drink after it's been through this natural treatment process, the city can treat it again when they pump if back out of the groundwater aquifers before they deliver it to people to drink.
And if the water's still not clean enough to drink after it's been through this natural treatment process, the city can treat it again when they pump if back out of the groundwater aquifers before they deliver it to people to drink.
After the water's been through this two-stage process, it's safe to drink.
The water gets put back in the Santa Ana River, it flows down to Anaheim, gets taken out at Anaheim and percolated into the ground, and becomes the drinking water of the city of Anaheim, completing the trip from the sewers of Riverside County to the drinking water supply of Orange County.
And let's do it for our children and our grandchildren and let's tell them this is the system that they have to take care of in the future because it's our last chance to create a new kind of water system.
I said, "How much is it worth?"
It's called bot or not, and you can go and play it for yourselves.
It's called bot or not, and you can go and play it for yourselves.
But basically, it's the game we just played.
You're presented with a poem, you don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer So thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online, so we have results.
Well, Turing said that if a computer could fool a human 30 percent of the time that it was a human, then it passes the Turing test for intelligence.
So, you give RKCP a source text, it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language, and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text. So in the poem we just saw before, Poem 2, the one that you all thought was human, it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called Emily Dickinson it looked at the way she used language, learned the model,
But the important thing to know about RKCP is that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using.
It's just raw material.
Rather, it is something that's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time.
So my final insight is that the computer, more or less, works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it.
We show it Emily Dickinson, it gives Emily Dickinson back to us.
We show it William Blake, that's what it reflects back to us.
We show it William Blake, that's what it reflects back to us.
We show it Gertrude Stein, what we get back is Gertrude Stein.
More than any other bit of technology, the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it.
And much of the conversation is, can we build it?
So that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future, we shouldn't only be asking ourselves, "Can we build it?"
So you wouldn't be making, like, 14 percent muscle and not using it, so it's likely doing something that has a functional role.
They would blend right into the algae, which would also fluoresce red, but they've got great vision, and they go through this long mating ritual, and perhaps they're using it in that effect.
Or is he looking back over his handiwork, the universe and his treasures, just like Michelangelo must have, looking back over his work in the ceiling and proclaiming, "It is good."
They are the motors of this great human engine, driving it forward.
And as Michelangelo proved in his painting, hardship, setbacks and obstacles, they don't limit excellence, they forge it.
That's where it all came about, and it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art, not indeed deface or destroyed it.
Or, "How does the computer know what happens when I press 'play,' how does it know which video to show?"
And I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it and the things Ruby taught me go like this.
This is Ruby's favorite dance move, it goes, "Clap, clap, stomp, stomp clap, clap and jump."
But then we would talk and we would discover that actually, a car is a computer, it has a navigation system inside of it.
And then I had this little girl who came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said, "This bicycle lamp, if it were a computer, it would change colors."
And I said, "That's a really good idea, what else could it do?"
And after we've assembled our computer together, we also design an application for it.
Indeed, we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move, and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion.
It has to coordinate more or less 200 muscles perfectly, because if the coordination is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion.
And if you place the salamander on the ground, it switches to what's called a walking trot gait.
So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot, and as you see, it's a cute little robot.
It looks a bit like a toy, but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat.
So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight, and also very elastic, so you can easily press it down and it will not break.
So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight, and also very elastic, so you can easily press it down and it will not break.
It will just jump, in fact.
Especially, it loses this descending modulation to initiate and modulate locomotion.
We're just less interested in doing it in the first place.
So it actually works.
And to the extent that we need to create economic growth over the long term, we're going to have to pursue it with a better form of economic stance.
Economic growth needs capitalism, but it needs it to work properly.
Economic growth needs capitalism, but it needs it to work properly.
This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality -- the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many.
The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills.
Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China.
And I think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world, the United States, has democracy, liberal democracy, as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism -- to the extent that it is free -- free market capitalism as its economic stance.
Over 2.6 billion people depend on it every single day.
We don't know what it ate during its lifetime, and we don't know what pollution it encounters.
And if it was a large predatory species, it might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday.
It's healthy, it prevents heart disease, and key fatty acids like Omega-3s, which is very different from almost any other type of meat.
If you feed salmon soy with nothing else, it literally explodes.
But it's had a really bad reputation.
This revolution is starting as we speak, it just needs scale.
Now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction.
And if we eat an animal, it needs to be one that had a happy and healthy life.
Who raised it, and what did it eat?
Who raised it, and what did it eat?
It's just a distraction.
And she had drank two glasses of that red juice at the Halloween party, and I mean, who can resist that red juice, right? It's so good.
And it begins with my student Nick.
Glucose is very important, and we know it's involved with diabetes.
When we looked at the glucose of diabetics, it was going up 60 milligrams per deciliter, not just 20.
If it's "pravastatin," the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline.
But we can't have a system that closes that data off, because it is too rich of a source of inspiration, innovation and discovery for new things in medicine.
It's called mass transit.
Could you have a cheaper ride cheap enough that people would be willing to share it?
In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too.
What happens is when the price goes down, people are more likely to take Uber at different times of the day than they otherwise would have, and they're more likely to use it in places they wouldn't have before.
That long neck and long tail help it radiate heat into the environment, passively controlling its temperature.
She's applying for a small-business loan from a commercial bank, because she now has the credit history to prove she deserves it.
Here are some ground rules for social justice comedy: first off, it's not partisan.
Two, it's inviting and warm, it makes you feel like you're sitting inside of a burrito.
Three, it's funny but sneaky, like you could be hearing an interesting treatise on income inequality, that's encased in a really sophisticated poop joke.
So I have to click it right now.
If you didn't know, Couchsurfing is a website that matches people who are looking for a place to stay with a free couch, from someone who's trying to offer it.
Well, you would think it's to match guests with hosts.
I can slow it down, speed it up, make it deeper, add an echo.
So basically, if you can make a color, only then can you see it.
So until then, even though a color might be all around them, they simply did not have the ability to see it.
It was invisIble. It was not a part of their normal.
And so we must continuously challenge our notion of normal, because doing so is going to allow us as a society to finally see the sky for what it is.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
So my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum, it starts swinging faster and faster, until it's at both extremes nearly simultaneously, and that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
But that meant that two years before the building was complete, it was already a part of the community, so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product, there were no surprises.
And it means that a building doesn't have to be beautiful to be lovable, like this ugly little building in Spain, where the architects dug a hole, packed it with hay, and then poured concrete around it, and when the concrete dried, they invited someone to come and clean that hay out so that all that's left when it's done is this hideous little room that's filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made, and that becomes the most sublime place to watch a Spanish sunset.
But it's also damaging health.
It has 3D vision and surround sound for what you're seeing and hearing right now, but that's just the start of it.
It has a sense of your body, pain, hunger, orgasms.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like scenes from your childhood playing before you.
And it has this constant voiceover narrative in your stream of conscious thinking.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.
But it also has some fundamental limitations so far.
On the one hand, it's a datum that we're conscious.
If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass, it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too, the way they are.
Now, I don't know if this theory is right, but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness, and it's been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data, and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.

It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality that underlies it.
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality that underlies it.
It's there right at its heart.
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think it's at least one worth taking seriously.
Okay, so this panpsychist vision, it is a radical one, and I don't know that it's correct.
I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental, than about the second one, that it's universal.
The purpose of these images is to inspire you, to motivate you, so that we can look at them and think, "Well, however bad my life is, it could be worse.
I'm quite fond of it.
It does the things that I need it to do, and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have, and that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well.
It makes life hard for us.
Disability doesn't make you exceptional, but questioning what you think you know about it does.
You don't know where it's going to land.
It's worth revenue, to the tune of billions of dollars a year.
Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most utilized sites in the world.
Gender has always been considered a fact, immutable, but we now know it's actually more fluid, complex and mysterious.
A few days after Malala was born, my daughter was born, my cousin came -- and it was a coincidence -- he came to my home and he brought a family tree, a family tree of the Yousafzai family, and when I looked at the family tree, it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors.
It was called Talibanization.
It spread like a crescendo all around the world.
The computer, using brain scan data alone, decoded that new brain scan to show what it thought the individual was actually seeing.
It might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
So within a matter of weeks, it happens again.
I was burning the pages of the script we had all followed for so long, but if you do not throw that grenade, it will kill you.
It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keep options open, with some strength T, with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S, up to some future time horizon, tau.
How predictive is it?
Does it predict human-level intelligence?
Does it predict artificial intelligence?
And secondly, we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
And secondly, we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.
It senses what I want to do, where I want to go, and then augments my strength and endurance.
It has sensors.
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video's really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun.
Play's a shapeshifter, and it can take many forms, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered anew.
We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human, such that it has a different right than a fetal life.
At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose, and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.
If it stopped twitching, you bury them.
I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.
The Founding Fathers rejected that idea, and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept, and that concept was all men are created equal.
This whole outfit, including the jacket, cost me $55, and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week.
you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses, at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said, shouted, "Perché non parli? Why don't you talk?"
So in this project, we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system.
Then we put a little chip, little tag, onto the trash and then started following it.
But the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear, it's still somewhere on the planet.
It started with a question by the mayor of the city, who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space, in architecture.
There's no doors or windows, but when you approach it, it will open up to let you in.
There's no doors or windows, but when you approach it, it will open up to let you in.
No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down, the architecture almost disappears.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline.
You can see here, it begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters.
We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open, mounted it to an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- you build this yourself, we publish the code for free, you download the software for free.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
It also needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our job to hand those things out.
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it.
And it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.
It could be, let's say for example, a U.S. power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.
Now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors -- so for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code, which is still running during the attack, with fake input data.
It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics, with centrifuges, with uranium enrichment.
So it would work as well, for example, in a power plant or in an automobile factory.
So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising, was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible, to get as many people to see it as possible.
It's unpredictable -- like this odd country road.
And it's also very risky.
It's not even online. It's not even streaming.
It's not even been out into other foreign countries yet.
I mean, I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online.
I mean, it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.
But you didn't need it to describe the large, everyday objects around us.
So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal, and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition, but it needs a little help to do it.
We turned off the lights, and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air, and then we cooled it down Now, all alone in the elevator, the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.

We found it was moving in really weird ways.
Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating, and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this -- like expanding and contracting bellows.
And by giving it a gentle nudge, we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.
And by giving it a gentle nudge, we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.
He showed it to Javier.
It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.
And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to clap your hands if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.
And during that session, we kept the session exactly the way it used to be, but we added one little thing.
It's been seen nearly 200 million times this year.
Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it.
An entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of.
My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain, and my lesson was to learn that, yes, history tried to crush us, but we endured.
A school uniform down to the ankles, because it had to last for six years.
"Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said.
"You have not let it go."
But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.
And getting this idea during winter, I knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically.
And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish.
It's got one knob, on/off.
But the thing is that it's made this simple that whenever I hop on, it sends my data through Google Health as well.
And people will be able, from their homes, to take their blood pressure, send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others, for instance, for over a hundred dollars.
We set up a website and asked the crowd, "If you see an AED, please submit it, tell us where it is, tell us when it's open," since sometimes in office hours sometimes it's closed, of course.
The program is called Code for America, and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.
So you agree to dig it out when it snows.
If you do, you get to name it, and he called the first one Al.
But it's doing something that no other government technology does.
It's spreading virally.
And Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows.
It suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company, as many people think it should.
But what's more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an ossified institution, but as a problem of collective action.
They are frustrated as hell with it, but they're not complaining about it, they're fixing it.
They are frustrated as hell with it, but they're not complaining about it, they're fixing it.
They are frustrated as hell with it, but they're not complaining about it, they're fixing it.
So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in: "Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead.
It connected those two people.
And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed, but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services.
So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time.
If I had really been a egotist, I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.
So an organism could, for instance, learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.

So an organism could, for instance, learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.
It could happen in learning time scales.
And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods that we don't quite even understand.
In fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well when it gets complicated.
And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology, to see how I could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it.
It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch.
It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our struggle.
And yet, in this country, in the states of the Old South, we execute people -- where you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black, 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched.
It will get to you.
And the next morning, I woke up and I thought, now did I dream that crazy motion, or did I actually write it?
And to my horror, not only had I written it, but I had sent it to court.
I've come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice.
And also, even though it's plotted on a log curve on the left, it's curving upwards.
You see, even though aluminum is 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass, it doesn't come as a pure metal.
It's all bound by oxygen and silicates.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth, in 1990 after it just passed Saturn?
He took a famous photo. What was it called?
When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus that it doesn't recognize, it calls the CDC and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place.
It's a game called Foldit.
It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle.
And it showed that, in fact, today, the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers.
That means hit the ball into the outfield, it dropped, it didn't get caught, and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time and the runner was safe.
We can't get rid of it.
Now this story, we have heard it lots of times on Galapagos and other places, so there is nothing particular about it.
That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides, which enables them to reset their baseline.
The U.S. Secret Service, two months ago, froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here, and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen.
Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae, but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis.
Instead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is much more effective. It's showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.
And with a mobile phone, you can record a song, load it up to SoundCloud and become famous.
Hold it up.
Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone, and how it changed my life.
You'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas.
You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people.
I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take back their health."
The funny thing about sustainability, you have to sustain it.
President. They didn't invent the title. I mean, it existed before, but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting.
And it didn't have much more grandeur than the term "foreman" or "overseer."
And that's why the Senate objected to it.
The war and the expatriate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fox fur and add it to a flack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashionable neo-traditional vests.
The worst part is putting this sweater over my head, because that's when you'll all laugh at me, so don't do anything while it's over my head.
Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building more than it needed the elections, which only reinforced polarization and division.
Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine.
And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it, the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence.
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless.
Now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second -- which is several femtoseconds -- I'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide, and that packet of photons, that bullet, will travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than an ordinary bullet.
Now, if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion, do you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie?
So, in the future, when this femto-camera is in your camera phone, you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it.
It's going to bounce, go inside the room, some of that is going to reflect back on the door, and then back to the camera, and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
Can we see it in full 3D?
The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America.
I live near this house, and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but by the next day, the wall was entirely filled out, and it kept growing.
You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, it's just never done. It's never done.
That means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and "Aha!" moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid-30s.
It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive.
I don't know what cat gut is, but let's assume it's formidable.
She's the author of "Strangers on a Train" and "The Talented Mr. Ripley," books that are all about how jealousy, it muddles our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy, the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant.
Fiction alone domesticates it, invites it to the table.
That question stayed with me, and it simplified a little.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think, and on days when it is really bad, you get used to it rather quickly.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a form of respiration or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
If they're not taking away trash efficiently and effectively every day, it starts to spill out of its containments, and the dangers inherent to it threaten us in very real ways.
It's not a birth defect. You can't catch it.
It's not a birth defect. You can't catch it.
Another tactic that he used is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it.
I have to tell you, it's very boring, but before I did yoga, I was a stand-up comedian who can't stand up.
This was a part that I was literally born to play and they gave it, they gave it to a non-palsy actress.
I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it, and I knew I would never get invited back.
We can, we must, but these four elements must all be present: Political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem; institutions must support its solution; It must really be a technological problem; and we must understand it.
We can, we must, but these four elements must all be present: Political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem; institutions must support its solution; It must really be a technological problem; and we must understand it.
It was just three days away.
I'd like you to notice the color of the door, the material that it's made out of.
I ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory, but also investigating it, trying to understand how it works, why it sometimes doesn't work and what its potential might be.

It is entirely untethered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull.
The idea behind the memory palace is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember -- the crazier, weirder, more bizarre, funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is, the more unforgettable it's likely to be.

Let's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech and you want to do it from memory, and you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it if he had been invited to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.
We often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift, but that is not the case.
To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows, about building it.
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort.
Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.
I'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others.
But trust, in the end, is distinctive because it's given by other people.
But you watch that movie enough times, and you start to realize how unusual it is.
It did not start that trend.
It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis.
And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis.
Aden saw an opportunity and seized it.
It's about creating a social impact.
Finding it randomly would be the equivalent of locating a needle in a haystack, blindfolded wearing baseball mitts.
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom -- it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago.
But to an outsider, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.
Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning.
